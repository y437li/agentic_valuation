[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kelyn Brannon, Chief Financial Officer.  This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2014. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website.  During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook and industry innovation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our Form 10-Q and recent prospectus, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our inaugural earnings call as a public company. I am pleased to report that we had a good second quarter. Strong customer demand for our products drove Q2 2014 results that exceeded consensus estimates. From a geography perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 74.8% of our sales. We are investing in global expansion of our international distribution.  Revenue grew by 65.2% year-over-year to a record $137.9 million, driven by sales of our flagship 7500E Spine and X-Series Spline platform. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 67.9%, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $0.35, as we grew profitably in a competitive and dynamic industry. Favorable mix and lower OpEx spend, especially in G&A, contributed to this outcome. In terms of customer trend, cloud scale economics and the need for OpEx reductions is driving data center infrastructure spend. It is a top of mind and growing priority for customers across our 4 principle verticals. There is also a clear understanding that the economics of the hyper-scale cloud are achievable within the enterprise using similar clarification approaches. We now have more than 2,700 customers going from a typical 1-a-day customer acquisition in 2013 to 1-to-2 a day at the present.  This quarter, we continued a breakthrough leadership via new product innovations and important standard space consortium. Arista furthered industry-wide open standard for announcing partnerships including Puppet Supported Program Certification for server automation, AVnu Alliance for Audio Video Bridging certification and a 25 and 50 gigabit Ethernet consortium with Broadcom, Google, Microsoft, Mellanox and Arista. Since then, the IEEE Standards and additional vendors have endorsed the approach of this consortium. Arista introduced the industry's first leaf switch with 100-gigabit Ethernet uplinks, the Arista 7280, for high-end storage and streaming content application. We believe we have once again outpaced the industry with this disruptive product. Arista also introduced the industry's first universal 40-gigabit Ethernet optic, designed to work on both multi-mode and single-mode fiber. Arista showcased advanced EOS software capabilities with Smart System Upgrades, SSU, at the leaf switch level with close to 0 downtime for software upgrade versus the typical minutes required by legacy alternatives. We also released the Arista 7500-based DANZ, Data AnalyZer, and OpenFlow 1.3 support as network visibility tools. In terms of architecture, Arista's universe of cloud-network approach is a fundamental shift from the old-school networking approach of pulling and reacting to a much more modern proactive model. We believe applications must be handled universally across a state-based programmable and open network. This migration from the archaic policy per app to a universe of cloud network based on modern workloads and workflows is crystal clear in Arista Network design. The legacy 1990s web, file and database tier in client-server architectures with north-south traffic is migrating to universal telemetry and automation for east-west and server-to-server traffic in the 21st century. In terms of wildcard topics, I'm frequently asked about our views on Facebook's Wedge announcement made in June of 2014. We welcome it, in short, as a validation of Arista. Arista has codeveloped API with Facebook, which run on our switches and offer functionality for specific applications in Facebook's network. Facebook's Wedge proposal is a reference design that is not attempting to address broad data center use cases. We believe Arista's EOS is a complimentary approach to Facebook's Wedge. The granular programmability across all elements of an Arista EOS switch has entailed more than 1,000 man year of engineering development in building that centralized shared system database state-oriented OS, which represents a decade of engineering investment from Arista.  Today's white boxes have limited support for these advanced capabilities. They are, if you will, more engineering building blocks and represent the LEGO approach to networking. We see these as complementary use cases for solo versus multiple applications.  Today, on our inaugural call, I'd like to highlight a special partner, VMware. We are very pleased with the growing partnership with VMware. It continues to get stronger and evolve at both a joint development and go-to market level. Arista's software architecture treats the entire network holistically across physical, virtual and cloud-based infrastructure without necessarily reinventing VMware's industry-leading installed virtualization platform. Arista is interoperable and adds value with existing VMware-based networks. We are committed to working with VMware products, be they ESX, vSphere, vCloud, NSX or vC Ops to optimally combine VMware's overlay and Arista's programmable underlay physical networks for the best network-wide virtualization deployment. Our joint efforts span 3 pillars and 3 phases. One, we have paid careful attention to the visibility of applications, flows, virtual machines and layer 2, 3, 4 addresses for a powerful troubleshooting suite of techniques across virtual and physical workloads with the right instrumentation and tools. Example, VM Tracer and Log Insight. Two, we've worked closely with VMware on OpenStack and OVSDB development as well as interoperability using VXLAN, virtual extensible LAN, a specification we both co-authored. Three, we offer a cloud network for private and hybrid cloud stack with support for the best of breed multi-protocol and multi-hypervisor environments. Our joint efforts and overall partnership represents 4 years of engineering and customer deployment for total network-wide orchestration and visibility. We look forward to seeing many of you at our booth at VMWorld in San Francisco later this month.  In summary, I'd like to recap by reminding all of you that Arista pioneered the concept of two-tier leaf spine in 2008 through 2010. And later in 2013, we introduced the one-tier spline for cloud networking.  Five years later, the cloud network is much more mainstream. While our peers are still trying to mimic this visionary approach, they lack the fundamental modern software technology or scale to achieve it. Throughout the years, we witnessed many failed attempts to lock in customers with proprietary fabrics, and yet our customers demand an open, agile and standards-based IP framework for their dynamic cloud applications.  With that, I'll wrap it up and turn the call over to Kelyn Brannon, CFO of Arista Networks. Kelyn Brannon : Thank you, Jayshree, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll walk through our unaudited statement of operations and compare the second quarter ended June 30, 2014 to the prior quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2013, and after that, I will briefly discuss the balance sheet. I'd like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation of selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Non-GAAP results exclude noncash expenses such as spot-based compensation and a one-time item that includes an unrealized gain on a note receivable. Revenue for the second quarter came in at a record $137.9 million, an increase of 18% compared to the $117.2 million for the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of 65% from the $83.5 million in the second quarter of 2013. Our business displays seasonality, and the second quarter is traditionally sequentially stronger than our first quarter. Q2 of 2014 was no exception. Second quarter comparisons year-over-year showed strong growth on a top of a record Q2 2013 with significant spend by our 4 principle verticals. International revenues comprised 25% of total revenues in the second quarter, an increase from 18% in the prior quarter of 2014 and an increase from 17% in Q2 2013. The geographic mix of revenue was 75% in the Americas, 15% EMEA and 10% APAC. The sequential and year-over-year quarterly increases reflect our existing U.S.-based global customers building out their data centers utilizing our international direct fulfillment centers for efficient purchasing. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 67.9% down from 69.6% in the prior quarter and up from 64.7% the year-ago quarter. The sequential decline primarily reflects a onetime benefit in Q1 2014 from a cash settlement that was not repeated in Q2, offset by reductions in required warranty reserves in the second quarter of 2014. In comparison to the prior year quarter, margin improvement resulted from reductions in required warranty and inventory-related reserves. Our performance in Q2 2004 clearly reflects movement in gross margin in accordance with our long-term business plan. Without the onetime benefits in Q1 2014 and the reduction in warranty and inventory-related reserves in Q2 2014, a normalized non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately 67% for both quarters. We expect our gross margins to average in the low- to mid-60% range in the long term. However, it can fluctuate up and down from quarter-to-quarter due to customer mix, product mix and the seasonality of our business. Turning to operating expenses, non-GAAP R&D spending was $31.4 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase from the $31 million from the prior quarter of 2014 and an increase from the $20 million in the corresponding period in 2013. The sequential increase reflects increased headcount offset by timing of prototype expenses. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the increase reflects headcount addition and project-related expenses supporting our development activities. Non-GAAP sales and marketing spending was $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase from the $17.2 million compared to the prior quarter of 2014 and an increase from $12.4 million in the corresponding period of 2013. The sequential quarter increase for the second quarter of 2014 reflects additional sales and sales engineer headcount, higher commissions in line with revenue growth and incremental marketing activities. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the increase reflects additional sales and sales engineer headcount and higher commissions in line with revenue growth. Non-GAAP G&A spending was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2014, a decrease from the $6.6 million compared to the prior quarter and an increase from the $3.2 million in the corresponding period of 2013. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower accounting fees and finance-consulting expenses. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the increase was driven by the cost associated with becoming a fully operational public company litigation expense and a corporate bonus accrual. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of 2014 was $37.4 million, an increase as compared to the $26.8 million in the prior quarter of 2014 and an increase as compared to the income of $18.3 million in the corresponding period of 2013.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 31%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2014 was approximately $23.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share using 67.5 million shares compared with a non-GAAP net income of $12.3 million or fully diluted earnings of $0.20 per share in Q2 of 2013 assuming the full quarter conversion of our IPO shares and the conversion of our notes payable and preferred shares to common shares. Our non-GAAP Q2 2014 fully diluted earnings of $0.35 per share was significantly impacted by a material movement of G&A spend into future quarters as our OptumSoft litigation was delayed, as well as certain accounting and finance compliance activities. Finally, OpEx spend was favorably impacted by timing of headcount additions in the back half of the quarter, which will have a full quarter run rate beginning in Q3 2014 as well as the onetime benefit from the reduction of warranty reserves. Turning to the balance sheet, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $397.2 million at June 30, 2014 including net IPO proceeds of $238.7 million. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2014 was $63.9 million and $55.3 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in the 6 months totaled $8.6 million and were primarily related to purchases of development, testing and manufacturing equipment. The accounts receivable balance was $67.9 million, an increase in the prior quarter balance of $63 million. Linearity in the quarter improved, which helped improve average days sales outstanding to 45 days down from the 48 days last quarter. Current and noncurrent deferred revenue was $61.7 million, an increase of $5.6 million over the prior quarter and primarily service-related. The increase resulted from new service agreement and renewals. Inventory was $71.1 million, a decrease of $7.9 million from the prior quarter of 2014, yielding inventory turns of 2.4, an increase from the 1.9 turns in the prior quarter of 2014. Let me now move to our guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, our revenue target is $142 million to $150 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 64% to 66% range. This excludes approximately $500,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margins in the range of 19% to 22%. This excludes stock-based compensation of approximately $8 million. We estimate DSO will be in the high 40s to low 50s, and inventory turns remaining around 2 per year. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events that may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Arista will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brian Marshall with ISI. Brian Marshall : Can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that revenue ramp going forward? Obviously, the numbers are getting bigger. Absolutely large numbers are just kind of kicking in, but you're still growing at a pretty phenomenal clip. Can you just talk a little bit about that? And I have one quick follow-up. Jayshree Ullal : Brian, as you know, we live in a competitive dynamic situation, but we also have a large total available market opportunity. We have -- we continue to acquire new customers, and we believe that our 4 principle verticals will drive majority of our growth, which is the cloud titans, the Tier 2 service providers, the financials as well as the high-tech enterprise. Of course, some of these types of customers tend to be lumpy, so while they're hard to predict for the quarter, we have received good acceptance and believe we can continue the growth and guidance we are sharing with you for Q3. Brian Marshall : Great, Jayshree. And Kelyn, quick one for you. If you think about your gross margins, obviously the longer-term guidance has forced some erosion there. If you look at the first half of 2014 versus the first half of 2013, you're obviously having some gross margin expansion. So could you talk a little bit about the drivers of what's pushing, propelling the margins up a little bit here? Kelyn Brannon : Thanks, Brian, for the question. Our gross margin is lumpy. It does vary a lot by product and customer mix, and so as we look forward into Q3, as we said, we're looking at a 64% to 66% range, and we still feel very comfortable with our long-term model of around 60% to 65%. Operator : Your next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : Did you have any 10% customers in the period? And if so, can you tell us how many and let us know what percent of revenue these customers represented? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, thank you very much. I'll take the question. We have only reported one 10% customer to date, which is Microsoft. And while we will not be reporting any customer concentration on a quarterly basis, that continues to remain our one customer concentration. Jess Lubert : And then on the operating margin, it sounds like some expenses slipped into Q3. So I want to understand if Q3 should reflect the low watermark for operating margins, off which we see gradual improvement moving forward. And do you expect them to remain in the high teens or low 20s for at least a few quarters? Any kind of color on how we should be modeling that going forward? And if we do see additional revenue upside, can we expect that to continue to flow through the bottom line? Kelyn Brannon : I'll let Jayshree address the additional revenue piece, but as I think about OpEx, I will not say that Q3 will be the low watermark simply because we have a number of things we're working on. So as you know, there's some litigation expense going on. By its very nature, it's going to be lumpy, so I can't say that Q4 or Q1 next year might have different impact. It's going to be a long process. Additionally, we have just started our SOX compliance work and continued to invest in our infrastructure, and that's going to continue in the short to medium term. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think you answered the question, Kelyn. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : If we could get a sense of the data center projects, most of them are very large cycle and project-specific, your overall visibility and pipeline outside of that and how you see the cycle spend by some of your larger customers; and overall, the visibility that you see from now, maybe perhaps at the end of the year as you accelerate your new customer addition. So kind of are some customers actually peaking? But are you actually seeing multiple cycles on top of that? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Mark. I'll take the question. First of all, you're absolutely right that data center projects tend to be very large. But for Arista, they first start out small. So every customer acquisition tends to be first a small project and then we have to earn the right to win the data center, if you will, which can be anywhere from 9 months to 2 to 3 years, right? So what you're seeing, for example, with a very large customer like Microsoft or any of our top 10 customers, is that progression from where we start with a small project to obviously becoming the mainstream data center vendor of choice, and that can be over a period of time. So we believe that in all our 4 verticals, we've got tremendous opportunity to deepen our engagements and relationships with every one of them and get more share of wallet with these data center projects. They could be in the area of compute, storage, virtualization, private cloud. You name it. But plenty of opportunity and plenty of market there, especially for 10, 40 and 100-gig. Mark Sue : And just on the 100, who are some of the early adopters? And as they move to 100 from 40, are you seeing the interest level and a pattern replicate itself from your other expanding verticals customers so they also have a line of sight from 10 to 40 to 100? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think it's safe to say that the majority of the market we see is really 10 gigabit to the server and compute, but we are starting to, as a result of so much 10-gig deployment, see both 40-gig to the storage especially from a peak traffic there as well as 100-gig between spines or as they interconnect between leaf and spines, I should say. 100-gig deployments tend to be future-proofing themselves for very high-performance content and media applications. They tend to be service providers and content providers and is especially reflected in 1 or 2 of our main verticals. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Northland. Jeffrey Kvaal : My first question, Jayshree, delves in a little bit more into your cloud titans commentary. When we assemble the CapEx numbers that come out of those cloud titans, there will inevitably be ups and downs in the CapEx numbers that come from them. How should we interpret that in terms of thinking through your results? I'm thinking in particular the Microsoft numbers this quarter weren't that great and yet you seem to have done fairly well. And then Kelyn, on your side, will you be reporting any book-to-bill or progress of services/metrics going forward? Jayshree Ullal : Go ahead. Kelyn Brannon : I'll take the last one so I remember it. So we have no plans to disclose any book-to-bill. We actually view customer acquisition as a leading indicator and bookings quite simply as a lagging indicator. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Kelyn. Thank you, Jeff. I think it's fair to say that we seek tremendous opportunity in getting pieces of the cloud titans' CapEx budget because they're all very big. They're in the billions going to trillion, and the networking piece of that is a small component. Very clearly, we've also said that 2013 was a peak year for both Microsoft in terms of their CapEx as well as Arista in terms of being deployed in Microsoft Azure. We continue to enjoy a very good partnership and relationship with them. But as our numbers get larger, we expect a percentage of customer concentration to specifically come down from that specific cloud titan as other titans pick up. We also see some movement between cloud titans and Tier 2 cloud providers and service providers. It's very possible that some of them that we described in the report says 1 of the 7 titans are small and some other ones may emerge. So I think the message to take away from this is the cloud is a mainstream intent not only for public cloud providers but also for service providers and Tier 2 cloud providers who expect to become primary ones, and therefore, additive opportunity in all of those cases for Arista. Operator : The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan with Juda Group. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : Two questions. First on the key verticals. All 4 verticals clearly going well. But Jayshree, I was wondering if there is some color, which are you think over the next 18 months the fastest-growing pieces. And also wondering if you could speak about the competitive environment given product constructions from your major competitors. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think -- thank you, Subu. I couldn't point to one of them being faster growing than the others because, especially this quarter, we were equally balanced across them, and so we believe -- there's nothing that stood out in any one particular vertical being favored over the other, if that was your question. In terms of competitive dynamics, I think the competitive pressures for us continue to be as they have been in prior quarters. No change, but always aggressive. We respect our peers a lot. Many of them have dominant and monopolistic positions and are not afraid to cut price to 0 and often bundle with their other products, and it's something we have to selectively choose to compete against or walk away from. So no change from previous quarter but ongoing competitive pressures. Operator : Next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum : A couple of things. Kelyn, can you give us a sense -- I know Microsoft weren't going to give a number, but can you at least give us a sense as to whether, on an absolute basis, whether they were up or down or kind of flattish from last quarter? And in your guidance for the following quarter for Q3, what are you expecting them to do kind of just directionally? Just give us a sense on that. That would be awesome. Second thing, share-wise, you're obviously growing much faster than all of your competitors. So technically speaking, I know you're giving share. But are there any accounts that you can point to of material size where they were incumbent with somebody else and you actually took share away, as in -- I mean, I guess the key word here is away, as in an opportunity that they should have -- your competitors should have one that you actually took some. And then finally, the 7280, the high-end storage market, that seems to me it'd be an incremental opportunity on top of the standardized data center switching market that you kind of were originally in it before the 7280. Can you give us a sense as to how large that market could be and what could that grow into and when do you start seeing that? Jayshree Ullal : That was a lot of questions there, Ehud. Ehud Gelblum : I agree. Jayshree Ullal : [indiscernible] Kelyn Brannon : Well, you did that very skillful. So I'm going to go first, so I can get the -- I'll get the Microsoft question out of the way. Microsoft is going to always continue to be a very important customer to us. And as we look at them, we said that we were looking at them kind of flat year-over-year, and that's the trend we're seeing. I would expect over time that they're going to settle in. They're going to be a 10% customer, but they're going to be somewhere in the teens. Jayshree Ullal : So your second question was, did you take share from competition and what's the reception on the 7280 then? It's -- we haven't seen the numbers yet for Q2, but we do believe it's a great software than the market, and we've typically grown 1 to 2 points every year that it wouldn't be surprising to us if we took share this quarter. But we don't have concrete numbers there, just a good wild analytical guess there. And the 7280, I'm very optimistic about this product and a number of customers have been very bullish. First of all, it's very unique value add. It's one of its kind. It's unbelievable and unimaginable that you can compress this kind of poor density in a 1RU Form Factor with 10 and 100-gig with multi-terabit of fabric in full layer 2, layer 3. The kind of applications we are seeing, as I pointed out, is there's a lot of customers who are interested in migrating to more scale out storage, extremely high-density, integrating with their high-performance terabits, storage clusters. This is probably the biggest one we see. And then in some cases also, there will be a slow-and-steady migration from fiber channel to Ethernet. Ehud Gelblum : So should we be looking at the fiber channel market as the opportunity that this can grow into? Jayshree Ullal : I think it's both the Tier 2 Ethernet market, which is more immediate, and then the long term. There is definitely a fiber channel to Ethernet migration. Ehud Gelblum : Okay. And Kelyn, can you just give us a direction on Microsoft? Did it go up or down from last quarter in Q2? Jayshree Ullal : I think what we want to give you in guidance is for the year, we expect it to be flat and become a lower concentration of our total revenue, most likely the teens. But we don't plan to give quarterly guidance on Microsoft. Operator : The next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Alex Henderson : I was hoping you could step back a little bit from your perspective. You've got a much better read on the overall cloud spending patterns than any of us. Most of the cloud titans are pretty tight on talking about their CapEx plans, but I would assume that you have some better vantage point than the industry as a whole on the financial side with half of that. Can you give us your read of what you think the rate of growth in the aggregated CapEx of those players is doing, whether it's sustaining at a high rate or whether it's accelerating, decelerating? Any color would be very helpful. Jayshree Ullal : I'll probably have to give you a short answer. Believe it or not, our customers are careful and cautious in informing us too, so we probably have a 1 to 2 quarter visibility, but not a 1 to 2 year visibility, right? And what's very clear is every one of our major customer prospects are in build out mode. They're in early stages mode. They're in customer acquisition mode, and they are responding to their customers. So it's not like the old days where they said, \"Build it, and they'll come.\" They build it in real time when they come, and so that requires us, as you can tell, to really respond very quickly to their needs, both from a lead time and future point of view. But I think our visibility is also in the 1 to 2 quarter time frame. Alex Henderson : If I could just ask one question on the financial side, and then I'll cede the floor. So obviously, you guys sharply outperformed expectations for the June quarter and your guide as well above what people had expected. I'm questioning whether you think that we should be trying to take that substantial upside surprise on the June and the September results and extrapolate that to higher levels as we look out over the next 3 or 4 quarters. I realize you don't want to give guidance that far out, but I think you've done a great job of keeping the expectations in check, so I just want to make sure that they stay commensurate to what you're looking out over more than one quarter for. Should we be assuming that you're able to ramp expenses faster than revenues at some point over the next 2 or 3 quarters to get those -- to bring those margins back under the 20% vicinity? Kelyn Brannon : Yes, I'm going to take the first part of it and then we can talk about what kind of what those operating margins look like. Today, you now have 3 out of our 4 quarters for 2014, 2 quarters of actuals and then our financial guidance. And if you look, you can see that we continue to experience very strong revenue growth, but the year-over-year growth percentage is declining as our overall revenue increases, so we expect that to continue onwards. And additionally, if you look kind of -- we can peek at Q4, but historically, Q4 is in line with the Q2 and Q3 numbers. And then I'm going to caveat it all by saying our quarters are very lumpy, and we really do keep a weather eye on our competitors because our competitors continue to be very aggressive out in the market. Alex Henderson : So costs will or will not catch up with revenue growth? Kelyn Brannon : I think, as I said, as we look over the next 12 to 18 months, we really benefited in Q2 by lower G&A and the push out of some of the litigation expense and SOX compliance work. And so you're going to see starting in Q3 going through 2015, if not into early 2016, increasing cost there as well as us getting SOX compliant by the end of 2015. Jayshree Ullal : And of course, we continue to aggressively invest in engineering that is the hallmark of this company, as well as sales and systems engineering. So we are making the investments, and we're reaping the benefits of investments we really made last year, this year. Operator : Next question is from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : A couple of questions, if I may. First, can you talk about -- you mentioned earlier about international expansion. Can you give us some more granularity on what you're doing to grow your business internationally? Obviously, you have a good exposure to North America, but international is still a small part of your overall revenue. Some granularity around that, and then I have a follow-up question as well. Jayshree Ullal : Well, Brian, thank you. We are continuing to be focused on the same 4 verticals that we identified in North America. Internationally as well. So a lot of them are global companies, so just making sure we adequately support them and expand our global footprint for major -- a lot of these companies as one aspect. The second is good old-fashioned investment both in our distribution and our channels. We are especially focusing on the developed country, so you can imagine that would be U.K., Germany, Nordics, Netherlands; and in Asia PAC : Japan, Korea; selective parts of the Asia subcontinent; Australia as well of course. So rather than doing a broad sweep of everywhere, we're really focused on the places internationally where -- which favors large data center projects. Brian Modoff : Okay. Fair enough. Will this be -- will you also work with large distributors in terms of anything international that you would expand into? How that could be [indiscernible]? Jayshree Ullal : Absolutely. Thank you for reminding me of that. Absolutely more so than the North America is the international is heavily dependent on distribution, and the distribution and partners are much, much more capable. It's almost -- the capability is proportional to distance, and so a very large part of our strategy is signing up, and we have already signed up important distribution in some of these major countries. Brian Modoff : And will you see the impact on the revenue side from these efforts? Kelyn Brannon : I think that and going back to our roadshow, we talked about that we are making investments in international and that we expect to see -- start to see fruition of that in the next 2 to 3 years. Brian Modoff : Okay. And then my follow-up question is in my understanding, Andy and Arista helped define the future set of Xpliant, which is the company Cavium purchased, and you're one of its lead customers. When do you expect to begin shipping products with the Xpliant switch? And what features and advantages does it have over your -- the competing solutions? Jayshree Ullal : I can't address the specific company or switch or product, but I can tell you that we appreciate silicon diversity. We have 3 architectures in our product portfolio already, and as new ones come in, we'll definitely evaluate them and look at them and build to them as they're good working products. Operator : The next question is Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : [Audio Gap] impact to cloud titans. The way it kind of came across in recent months is that there are several cloud titans that you guys are going to pursue. And I'm wondering 3 months in since we last spoke about this, how close are we to ramping one of these new ones materially? Is it something that you would expect over the next 12 months? And I'm just thinking how that might impact your financials because you previously implied that, that's probably going to be gross margin dilutive. Obviously, it didn't really have much of an impact this quarter. I'm just wondering going forward, is that something that you still expect? Then the second question I have is more linked to gross margins for your business full stop, which is that there's a cloud pressure maybe that comes. I understand that. But how about the 2 other pressures that you're dealing against the, as you said, monopolistic competitor and they can respond? Have you seen any evidence of that recently? And then the next one, gross margin, is just that if you do integrate with VMware successfully, isn't there a risk that you have a commoditized part of the deal? And is that really a 60% gross margin business long term? I'm just wondering how you see all those dynamics playing out. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. You managed to get in 3 questions. I'll try to answer them backwards. First of all, I want to address the VMware friend or foe very clearly. We believe that we have formed a very technical and customer-driven partnership with VMware, and I don't know why the industry thinks that it needs to be a foe or a friend. Because really, VMware has brought tremendous status and market and customer capability and virtualization, and companies like Arista are doing the same with physical networks. What's lacking right now is the best of both being combined. They're really 2 different islands, and we believe the ideal customer solution is not companies fighting, but in fact, integrating and bringing the migration from physical to virtual to cloud. And so we very much believe it's complementary. We very much believe a good programmable underlay requires a good set of overlays. We couldn't be more pleased. And architecturally, we view it as not one versus the other, but better together. So in terms of cloud pressures and cloud margins, and et cetera, we have always said that margins from our cloud titans, because they're driven by large volume, is lower than our standard margin. Our margins are deeply tied to volume. And obviously, as a customer buys more volume, they get to influence the pricing and, therefore, our margin. We do expect new cloud titans to come in. We don't know if they'll be over 10% in customer concentration. In fact, most likely they may not, but there may be many of them at less than 10% customer concentration, and we're kind of like that. That's part of the balanced verticals that we are aiming for from a strategy perspective, but absolutely, we expect more than the ones listed today. Kulbinder Garcha : And then the final one, Jayshree, just on the pressure from the -- your major competitor. Have you seen any change in how they're behaving in the market? Have you factored any of that in? Jayshree Ullal : No, it's been predictable and the same. Operator : Your next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : A couple of questions. I wanted to follow-up on international Puppet first. Can you talk a little bit about the nature of the international customer base? Are they similar to the U.S. customers in that they're mostly large cloud properties? That is, are we likely to see equal amounts of lumpiness out of the international customer base? Or is there a different make up there? And then along a similar line or similar and related question is, how should we think about the tax rate going forward? Should we expect it over time? Eventually, you will have more of your revenue earnings to abroad, and that would typically bring down your effective tax rate. If so, over what time would you expect that to happen? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so thanks, James. The answer to your international question in a nutshell is we are in 84 countries with the right demo depots and customer support and subsidiaries. We believe out of those 84, at least over 50 of them are purchasing Arista product in some fashion or the other. They tend to be very similar to the way we started in the United States in America, which is start with small projects and then expand to bigger ones. It's too early to call which ones are the bigger ones because we're just beginning there, so give us some time. But hopefully, they will mimic the pattern. But so far, we see that it's very similar. They're in similar verticals, the financials, the high-tech media, the high-tech enterprise. They're in service providers. They're in cloud providers. So the pattern is similar, but the size of the project is smaller. Kelyn Brannon : And then as for the kind of rethink about our effective tax rate, as I mentioned, the Q2 effective tax rate was around 31%. As I look forward to Q3, we're looking at a very similar number between 31% and 32%. And then as we continue to drive, you see the split in our international business. So over the medium term, as our international business grows, it's going to have effect and drive -- help reduce our effective tax rate, but not -- but it's over the medium term as we invest in international and continue to grow that business. What will probably have more of an impact for all of us and including our competitors and all companies will be the reestablishment of the R&D tax credit hopefully happening in Q4. That will have a more of a near-term impact on us versus the international versus domestic split. Operator : Next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have 3 quick questions. First one is the -- when we spoke about margins for the year, this year, you saw that margins -- after you reported Q1, you saw that margins for the year will be 12% operating margin, and that's why we model about 10% for the rest of the year. You're coming up at 27%, which is not -- it's more than 5% of us. So the question is what changed in the quarter that only a few weeks ago you thought that this year will be 12% and now suddenly it's almost double that level if we just continue in the fourth quarter? So what happened in the quarter? Or what happened in the last few weeks since the IPO? Second question is when VMware said that they have $109 of revenues in the space, it was kind of a surprise for a few of us. It was a big number, and the question I have is how much of your growth is done through VMware or together with VMware? And how much of it is done directly with the customers? And I'm trying to understand your independent participation in the market versus participation in certain ecosystems. The third and last question is an easy one, why is 2Q strong always? Last year was the strongest quarter of the year on a sequential basis. And at least according to what we expect this year, it's going to be again. What's happening now that is not happening in other quarters? Jayshree Ullal : Tal, thank you very much. So I -- while Kelyn is getting ready for answers, I'll address the VMware one, and then we'll go to your operating margin and Q2 question. So I think the $100 million from NSX was quite impressive, and it shows the power and importance of OpenStack and vShield and layer 4 to 7 and bringing all of these technologies from a networking perspective in a virtual fashion. We are independent, but we jointly sell together especially at a technical level with VMware. In other words, our systems engineers worked together and often provide network designs, and it's still early days. We're only formally announcing the partnership today for the first time on this call, and you'll see subsequent announcements later. But I'd say that network virtualization and the drive to bring multi-hypervisors and networks together is really one of the biggest use cases of SDN, and many pilot projects are starting today, and we expect to see a growing set of customers and more applications in the next few years. Kelyn Brannon : So as your question on gross margins, as I mentioned in my script that operating margins really, really benefited by a push out of some spend that we had been anticipating in G&A primarily around the OptumSoft litigation. Also, we were -- during the IPO process, we had a patent troll that suit us that we had budgeted litigation expense for which we successfully settled a couple of 3 weeks ago, right before the end of the June quarter. And additionally, we had planned on starting SOX work and public company compliance work within Q2 and actually just hired our director of internal audit towards the end of June, and so that spend has now been pushed out for Q3, Q4 and for 2015. Additionally, gross margins benefited primarily around a release of some warranty reserves that are not required to continue on, and that's kind of a onetime benefit. So those actually were the major impacts if you think about kind of operating margins and how we came down to our non-GAAP EPS. Tal Liani : Did you disclose the amount of the warranty reserves that were reversed? Kelyn Brannon : Yes. It's -- the gross amount of the reserve was about $1 million, and it's in the 10-Q, which you'll see later today. Tal Liani : Okay. And why is 2Q so strong on seasonality basis? Jayshree Ullal : This is just customer buying pattern. Technically, come out of a weak Q1. January and much of February is usually very slow and then they get on track, so we see this every year, and this is no surprise. Operator : And the next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Sanjiv Wadhwani : [Audio Gap] and whether would that product being available? Has there been any sort of change in pricing dynamics from that company? Jayshree Ullal : Sanjiv, we missed the entire first half of your question. We only got the last few words. Can you repeat it? I'm sorry. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Okay, so just trying to figure with Cisco's ACI now generally available, whether would those any customer feedback that you might be able to share in terms of what you're picking up? And then generally in terms of pricing from Cisco, again with the ACI, has there been any change in terms of pricing dynamics from that company? Jayshree Ullal : I think you know this better than I do, but we have not seen the effects of ACI because the promise of ACI has been greater than the delivery and shipment. I believe it was announced to ship June 30, so it's too early to call. So we'll probably see the impact of ACI more in the second half of this year and next year, but I think it's been more marketing than reality until now. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Got it. And then, I guess, same applies for pricing dynamics. No sort of shift because it's... Jayshree Ullal : That's not true. Pricing dynamics goes beyond one specific product. It is continuously a day-to-day combat for Arista to deal with, and I think it's a lifetime issue for Arista to coexist and interoperate and compete with our competitors especially the one we respect, so that hasn't changed, and it doesn't change. It's not on a product basis. It can be a specific product. It can be a bundle. It can be a discount. It can be a figure. It can be a variety of techniques. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : So following up in terms of kind of the bridge questions, particularly on gross margin. I think you were anticipating a lower gross margin this quarter. You put up a very nice gross margin. So could you help us understand the bridge between what you had expected 90 days ago and what you reported? And then take us to essentially the bridge or trajectory of why you think your gross margins will come to that lower range that kind of 60% to 65% range over time in terms of what about the decline is relative to international or competitive environment. Just help us understand the levers there. Kelyn Brannon : So I'll take the first part of the question and then turn it over to Jayshree. But if we think about -- when we look at our gross margin, it really varies a lot by product and by customer mix, and so that played a big part. We also, in the quarter, we planned for aggressive tactics from our competition whose products are not yet generally available, so we had planned for that. But in addition, gross margin also benefited from that onetime warranty benefit from the change of estimates that impacted and drove our gross margin up, which is a onetime effect. Jayshree Ullal : Simon, just to add to that. If you look back on our history, we've had gross margins of 64.6% and 65%, so depending on the mix and the concentration and the volume and the type of customer. It is -- and if you look at the standard gross margins in the switching industry, they do tend to be in the 60% to 65% range. I think our aggressive engineering focus on cost reductions and also being selective on what markets we are targeting and were not in the mainstream commodity market allows us to, if you will, manage our mix and our gross margin. But I want to make one thing clear. We are going to favor lower gross margin to gaining footprint and market share, and so we'll continue to signal to you guys that our long-term goal is 60% to 65% in favor of gaining share. Now if it doesn't materialize 1 quarter, it might the next or the following, right? So understand our long-term goals doesn't always vector into the short-term quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Lucia with JMP Securities. John Lucia : I know you said you didn't have any concentration in a specific vertical this quarter overall, but you said you're adding about 1 to 2 new customers a day versus 1 in 2013, and I was wondering if there's a concentration in 1 or 2 verticals or for new customers specifically. Jayshree Ullal : That's actually a good question, John. We're actually seeing more additions on our new customer acquisition in the high-tech enterprise, where we've been noticeably more absent in the last few years. So while we're adding in every vertical, I would say that vertical is getting more new customers. John Lucia : Okay. And then one more question. Can you talk about how your partnership is with the layer 4 through 7  players like Palo Alto and Aruba progressing? How often are you working with these partners? And how often are they bringing you into deals? And are you bringing these vendors in to compete against your largest competitor when it sells bundled solutions? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think the partnership with 3 companies you mentioned, Aruba, Palo Alto and F5, are very strong. They tend to be more, again, in the business development and joint systems engineering, so we don't force the sales teams to work together. They have to be customer-driven. To give you examples, in the case of Aruba, we're doing some very interesting work on wired and wireless controller integration. With Palo Alto, we've already demonstrated some really cool capabilities on how you can expand your firewall flows and migrate from 10-gig all the way to multi 10-gig and even up to 100-gig. With F5, we've had a long-standing partnership integrated into their iRules, and they're also doing some very interesting work on workflows and Smart System Upgrades all the way from layer 1 to 7. So every one of them are not just a logo we put on the release but really a technology linkage, and therefore requires systems engineering cooperation, and it's something we do directly and together with the customer. Operator : Your next question is from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin : Actually just had a couple of follow-ups, one for Jayshree on VMware and Kelyn on margins. Jayshree, on VMware, obviously, you're formally announcing the partnership today. You highlighted and talked about some of the technical benefits. My question is really around how are you viewing that relationship relative to broadening your footprint in the enterprise? Is this a go-to market opportunity for you? Obviously, you're very strong on the cloud side, but what's your view relative to VMware opening some doors for you on either enterprise or service provider account? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, now that's a -- hey, Brent, that's a good question. I certainly think VMware has one of the strongest and broadly installed base of products with ESX hypervisor and vCenter and vC suite. We also believe that the -- so therefore, based on that, I would say VMware can certainly help Arista open doors in the enterprise. But we also think the NSX and the integration of NSX and the programmable Arista EOS is a joint opportunity for both companies to implement OpenStack and private cloud as well as in public cloud and service providers, and -- so we see that, yes, we could get some help on the enterprise but we could also help them and work jointly together in cloud projects. Brent Bracelin : Certainly sounds like something you highlighted, and want to certainly follow with you more on that one. Kelyn, on margins, I wanted to go back here to op margins. I mean, obviously, if I go back over the last couple of years, 16% was the lowest quarterly operating margin. You're guiding to 19% to 22% in Q3 including litigation expenses that are starting to ramp up. Why shouldn't we think about high teens as kind of a low watermark for operating margins for this year and next? Or is the gross margin the big variable there that gives you a little caution? Just trying to understand margins and what we've seen this year and in the past. And why shouldn't that kind of high teens be the low watermark going forward? Kelyn Brannon : So from my chair, and I'm going to put gross margins to the side because that's always the big equalizer, right? But I would look at over 2014, 2015 that if you think about, yes, we will be kind of in those high teens as kind of the low watermark, and we do, and as you notice, we do again focus and can continue to manage operating expense. As we move through the work that's going on with litigation and public company compliance, we would expect at some point in the medium to longer term to return into the -- into the 20s, low 20s. Operator : The last question is from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum : A very quick follow-up. Can you just, Kelyn, give us the quarter ending share count? And what we should be looking at for share count for next quarter? Really simple. Kelyn Brannon : So absolutely, so for next quarter, if I was modeling, I would be looking at that 70 million to 71 million. We're very conscious of the movement in our stock price. So the higher the stock price, you know what that does on the waiting of the share count. And so for this quarter, the Q will be filed around 5 :00 tonight, and I believe it was around 61 million. Chuck Elliott : Okay. Well, this concludes the Arista Q2 2014 earnings call. I'd like to say thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

During the call all participants will be in a listen only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relation section of the Arista website following this call.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott :  Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Bechtolsheim, Arista Networks Founder and Chief Development Officer and Kelyn Brannon, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2014. If you would like a copy of the release you can access it online at the Company\u2019s website. During the course of this conference call Arista Networks\u2019 management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2014 fiscal year and industry innovation which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our Form 10-Q and recent prospectus and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal :  Thank you Chuck. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our second earnings call as a public company. I am pleased to report that we had a good third quarter. Strong customer demand drove results that exceed the consensus estimate. From a geography perspective our customers in the Americas generated 81% of our sales. We are investing to improve our global expansion. Revenue grew 53% year-over-year to a record $155.5 million, driven by our flagships 1500E series Spine and X-Series Spline platform. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 65.2%, resulting in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 as we grew profitably in a competitive and dynamic industry. We now have 2,885 customers, going from one new customer a day last year in 2013 to more like one to two a day at the present. We have now shipped a cumulative of 3 million cloud networking ports. Our first million ports took us approximately 48 months or four years. Our second million took about 18 months and our third million has arrived at about nine months, more than five times faster than the original million took us. This quarter we further expanded our product line and continued aggressively to drive open standards in conjunction the key partners. We announced seven new leased platforms, ranging from our cost effective 7010 to our 128 port 7050X, all available now and all based on one common EOS image. We delivered Arista\u2019s EOS 4.14 software release for enhanced network virtualization, Virtual Extensible LAN, VXLAN and resiliency using Equal Cost Multi-Path ECMP and Layer 3 functionality. We indentified and quickly fixed the Shellshock Linux BASH vulnerability across all our platforms in just five days from first disclosure by September 29, 2014. Our single-image software architecture across our products made it possible to this quickly and efficiently. We formally announced our joint efforts with VMware for total network-wide orchestration, including key initiatives for EVO Rail converged infrastructure structure at VMworld in San Francisco. Our other three ecosystem announcements were participation in A10 Security Alliance, the Orion Alliance with Nebula and SYNNEX for turnkey private cloud solutions and Riverbed-Ready Alliance for cloud application-aware management.  Arista's newly introduced 7280E switch with 100 gigabit Ethernet uplinks and large buffers continues to be well received by the market as an industry first. We are undergoing many pilots with this switch in high-end storage and streaming content application. Today\u2019s hot topic is Arista\u2019s 10th Anniversary. As we celebrate our first decade, I would characterize Arista\u2019s journey in three phases. Our first phase as we began as Arista Networks in Palo Alto in October 2004 with innovative founders and funding. Andy, David and Ken pioneered a new class of software that the industry calls FDN but is now adopted by Arista customers as Arista EOS, our Extensible Operating System. In the next phase 2009 and beyond Arista has fulfilled its disruptive vision for our customers which softly driven cloud scale networking, both for cloud type, hyper-scale web customers as well as the financials. In our next phase, 2014 and beyond Arista EOS is indeed a fitting example of our Company\u2019s evolution from products to platform, as we move into mainstream acceptance, growth and market share. Our strategy is based on the foundation of R&D investment with Merchant Silicon diversity, distributed system, state driven software, agile releases and modern methods for tools, kernel and open programmable functions. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Andy Bechtolsheim, Arista\u2019s Founder, Chairman and Chief Development Officer as our guest speaker to look back at these 10 memorable years. Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim :  Thank you, Jayshree. When we started Arista 10 years ago we had three fundamental beliefs. First, we believed that great software was the most important element in building a differentiated Ethernet switching company. Second, we believe that Merchant Silicon would allow us to build superior switches compared to traditional ASIC designs. And third, we believe that cloud data centers would continue to grow rapidly and would require network architectures with a scale and robustness that are fundamentally different from traditional legacy network designs. All of these three beliefs have proven to be true and have guided us well. On the software side we created the most programmable and resilient networking stack in the industry, our Extensible Operating System. On the Silicon side, working with our Merchant Silicon suppliers has allowed us to deliver superior performance and pull away from proprietary ASIC switch designs and our cloud customers are using our products to build cloud networks on a scale that is simply unprecedented. In summary, we have built the right architecture for the cloud and continue going forward with the same focus on software, best of breed silicon and scale. I now want to cover most of highlights in our history. We spent roughly the first four years in software and hardware product development, started shipping our first product, which was the ultra-low latency 7124S in Q3 of 2008. Jayshree and myself joined the Company at that time and business when we officially launched the Company as well. Our initial market focus was on high performance computing and on financial applications involving high frequency trading, which despite the financial crisis in 2008 took off rapidly and established Arista as the leading provider of switches for high frequency trading. However, our real ambition from the beginning was to build large scale cloud networks. For this we developed the Arista 7500 modular switch, that was the first product that allowed customers to build cost effective large scale leaf spine architectures. The Arista 7500 received the Best of Interop Grand Prize and the Best of Networking Award in 2010 and then again in 2013 for the 7500E update, which supports up to 280 40 gig ports, making the Arista 7500 the only product in the history of Interop that has received this very prestigious award, not just once, but twice. We now have over 20 switching products in our Spline X-Series, which includes the 7050X, 7250X and the 7300X families that all has become extremely popular building blocks for building highly scalable, programmable and reliable enterprise and cloud networks. On the software side, we have driven programmability into all levels of the network stack which has allowed us to integrate with a wide variety of third-party management tools including Splunk, Chef and Puppet. We have innovated with features such as Zero Touch Provisioning, Zero Touch Replacement, [Lanz, Stanz] and unprecedented network visibility. A key milestone in the history of our Company has been the introduction of the VXLAN certification in 2012, which we co-offered with VMware. VXLAN allowed the dynamic creation of essentially unlimited number of layer 2 networks over layer 3 networks, eliminating the legacy silo problem. We have also partnered with Broadcom, Google, Microsoft and others to define a standard for 25 and 50 gigabit Ethernet, which we believe will become very important as soon as it\u2019s commercially available. Which brings us to the present, we\u2019re very excited about our new product and development and our innovation pipeline has never been stronger. Our open software driven approach to networking based on the programmability of our Extensible Operating System is resonating with customers and partners who are looking to build best of breed, scalable and resilient networks. And we\u2019re looking forward to the next 10 years on this journey. With this, back to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal :  Thanks Andy. So while our peers are still trying to mimic Arista's approach, they fundamentally lack the architecture to achieve this. As Andy described, our journey has just begun. We are looking forward to serving our shareholders and sharing our inflexion points and aspirations in the continued journey and quests further. With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Kelyn Brannon, our Chief Financial Officer of Arista for more details on Q3. Kelyn Brannon :  Thank you, Jayshree and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll walk through our financial results for Q3 and our guidance for Q4. I\u2019d like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation of selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Q3 revenue grew 13% sequentially and 53% over the prior year quarter to a record $155.5 million. Third quarter comparisons year-over-year shows continued strong growth on top of a record Q3 2013 with continued significant spend by our four principle verticals. International revenues comprised 19% of total revenues in the third quarter, a decrease from 25% in the prior quarter of 2014 and an increase from 16% in Q3 2013. The geographic mix of revenue was 81% in the Americas, 14% EMEA and 5% APAC. This sequential decrease reflects lower deployment by our U.S. based global customers into their international data centers. The year-over-year quarterly increase reflects our U.S. based scalable customers deploying to their international datacenter as well as an expanding international customer base. Gross margin for the third quarter was 65.2% down from 67.9% in the prior quarter and up from 64.1% the year ago quarter. This sequential decline primarily reflect an increase in the number of large volume customers as well as an increase in overhead cost. In comparison to the prior year quarter margin improvement resulted from reductions and required warranty and inventory related reserves and scaling operations with our revenue growth. Our performance in Q3 clearly reflects movement in gross margin in accordance with our long-term business plan. We expect our gross margin to average in the low to mid 60% range in the long-term. However it can fluctuate up and down from quarter-to-quarter due to customer mix, product mix and the seasonality of our business. Turning to operating expenses. R&D spending for Q3 was $31.9 million, increasing sequentially from $31.4 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $25.3 million in the corresponding period in 2013. The sequential and year-over-year increases reflect headcount addition offset by timing of protocol expenses. Sales and marketing spending for Q3 was $18.6 million, relatively flat compared to the $18.8 million in the prior quarter and an increase from the $13.8 million in the corresponding period of 2013. The sequential quarter change reflects seasonally fewer marketing activities in the quarter offset by additional sales and sales engineer headcount and higher commissions in line with revenue growth. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the increase reflects headcount addition and higher commissions as we expand our sales and marketing activities to support the growth of our business. G&A spending for Q3 was $9 million, increasing sequentially from $6.2 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $4.8 million in the corresponding period of 2013. The sequential quarter increase reflect additional accruals for the corporate bonus program and increases in insurance and taxes. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the increase was driven by cost associated with becoming a fully operational public company, litigation expense and a corporate bonus accrual. Operating income for the third quarter of 2014 was $42 million increasing sequentially from $37.4 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $21.2 million in the corresponding period of 2013. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 30.5%. Net income for Q3 was approximately $28.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share using 69.7 million shares compared with a net income of $14.4 million or fully diluted earnings of $0.23 per share in Q3 2013 assuming the full quarter conversion of our IPO shares and the conversion of our notes payable and preferred shares to common shares. Our results for Q3 were significantly impacted by continuing movement of OpEx spend into future quarters from the timing of headcount and prototype expenses, as well as certain accounting and finance compliance activity. Turning to the balance sheet, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $408.6 million at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the nine months period ended September 30, 2014 was $98.7 million and $87.9 million respectively. Capital expenditures in the nine months totaled $10.8 million and were primarily related to purchases of development, testing and manufacturing equipment. The accounts receivable balance was $84.1 million, an increase from the prior quarter balance of $67.9 million. Day sales outstanding was 50 days in Q3, up from 45 days last quarter. Current and non-current deferred revenue was $77.7 million, an increase of $16 million over the prior quarter and primarily resulted from new service agreements and renewals. Inventory was $62.6 million, down from $71.1 million in Q2 \u201814 yielding turns of three. The decrease primarily resulted from a reclassification of spare parts from inventory to other assets. Let me now move to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 our revenue target is $160 million to $168 million, gross margin is anticipated to be in the 63% to 65% range and we anticipate operating margins in the range of 22% to 25%. We estimate DSO will be in the low 50s and inventory turns remaining around three per year. As a reminder, Arista will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sanjiv Wadhwani :  A couple of questions. I know in the prepared commentary you talked about all your four verticals doing nicely. I was just wondering if you could sort of highlight maybe one or two that did exceptionally well and then looking out over the next 12 months what your expectations are? And then second question, competitively Jayshree, I was wondering if you could update us on what\u2019s going on comparatively, given that your biggest competitor obviously has volumes that are picking up with their new products. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal :  Thank you, Sanjiv. Yes, so regarding our four verticals, the pattern was very similar to last quarter. We are continuing to see a very nice balance across all four of them. Usually we expect more lumpiness with our cloud titans, but both calendar Q2 and Q3, we\u2019ve certainly received important orders from our cloud titans, but that\u2019s been very nicely balanced by two other important verticals, our financials and our service providers and Tier 2 cloud providers. So I would say to you that it was very smooth and balanced across our high-tech enterprise, financials, cloud titans and service providers. In terms of competitively, no major changes. We continue to see aggressive pricing behavior and aggressive discounting whenever Arista is in a deal. We continue to co-exist many accounts. Many of our customers are demanding and necessitating better technical solutions and also wanting deal source vendors. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Faucette :  I just wanted a follow-up on the question on the customer base, just wondering if that balance in business that you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters as you look into the December quarter and the visibility you may have beyond is, is that balance persisting kind of across different verticals or should we expect a little bit more lumpiness as you said particularly from the cloud titans in the next couple of quarters. And then I just wanted maybe a clarification from you Kelyn, and just you talked little bit about OpEx coming in as maybe being delayed or pushed out a little bit, related especially around new hiring et cetera, should we take that to mean that things were pushed from the September quarter to the December quarter or that they\u2019re being pushed in the December quarter out into 2015. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James. I\u2019ll take your first question and Kelyn will take the second. As you might recall we experienced lumpiness with the cloud titans in Q1, where one of our customers, Microsoft especially was a large piece of our customer concentration. We\u2019ve seen more balance in Q2 and Q3. It would not surprise me in Q4 to once again experience some lumpiness that typically ends up being a strong quarter, our largest quarter usually for the year and also typically a quarter where we experience large customer concentration purchases. It may not necessarily be one particular titan. It could be a different one, but we fully expect that. In fact we are presently surprised to see the smoothness and balance the last two quarters. Kelyn Brannon :  And then James to your question on OpEx, we have seen a push out from Q3 into Q4, particularly around as we think about ramping up our stocks compliance work and both remediation work as we work through our stock compliance and it will also push out into the first half of 2015. And then as far as hiring is concerned, we continue to have a very high bar as we hire, and we\u2019re out bringing more folks in, in all of our functions primarily around sales and marketing and R&D but we\u2019re going to continue to keep our standard high and hire thoughtfully. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Modoff :  Yes, few questions, one on the, you had the 10% customers in the quarter and second is around pricing, what you\u2019ve seen on the pricing environment competitively, what kind of pricing pressures you\u2019re seeing on a per quarter basis? Is it kind of moving to your expectation or are you seeing anymore aggression out of perhaps Cisco or maybe even Juniper. And then finally for Andy, the 25 gig and 50 gig products you're looking to bring to market, has that targeted at the cloud titans again and should we expect to see those in the market rents? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So, Brian, I\u2019ll take the first question and then Andy of course will take the 25 gig, 50 gig. In terms of was there any customer concentration, we continue to only have one customer, who is going to contribute to the concentration and while their percentage contribution continues to come down, I think we shared with you last time, it has come down, the teens and double digits. We do not see anything more in terms of contribution greater than 10%. In terms of pricing pressure, the 10 gig market, as you well know has been exploring in ports, and we Arista have been progressive and almost proactive in bringing down the cost of 10 gigabit port, so that customers can more quickly move to 1 gig. So we do see not pricing pressure but aggressive price points that Arista themselves are providing on 10 gig. We have also witnessed a greater acceptance of 10G-BASE-T as an alternative to 1 gig, but I would not say we\u2019re getting any greater pricing pressure than we always get and we consistently get from our competition. The number one and only competitor we really see is the major market leader as you know in the industry and everybody else we see occasionally and rarely. Andy Bechtolsheim :  Okay, on the 25 gig and 50 gig question, this is a feature or function that's supported by future, next generation Silicon, which is in development. We cannot comment on this call about the availability dates on such products, but the key thing is and the reason to build this consortium is we have to respect that the silicon vendors can build the silicon too so that when it arises as the product in the market it\u2019s actually fully compatible and this is the effort that we are participating with to ensure the earliest availability of such products. Brian Modoff :  Okay, and then targeted customers for that? Andy Bechtolsheim : Well, it is available to any customer of course. We do believe that cloud, the large cloud customers will be the earlier adopters. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha :  Thanks, I\u2019ve a clarification. Jayshree, did you say -- you did have a 10% customer. Microsoft was an over 10% customer this quarter, I just want to clarify before I have my main question. Jayshree Ullal :  Just to clarify, we only have one 10% customer and that\u2019s Microsoft. Kulbinder Garcha : Got it, okay and then my question for you is, just in terms of, given the customer traction that you\u2019re seeing, can you speak about the various forms of distribution for Arista\u2019s product portfolio that you guys are beginning to think about maybe more international diversification, that kind of thing? And my question for Andy is, I think around the time of the IPO you did mention that Arista, given the technology advantage you have would look at adjacencies. Where is the thinking on the product roadmap? Any discussion there would be helpful as we look into next year? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, I\u2019m going to take the question for Andy. While we\u2019ve talked about long adjacencies, we have been very clear both in the road show and our public calls that our maniacal focus is the data center, especially for 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig. This is such a tremendously large market opportunity, anywhere from 6 billion to 10 billion in the next few years that Arista wants to be focused there and be the absolute best of breed there and today we are the number two player and we look forward to improving that market share. Kulbinder Garcha : And then on the distribution? Jayshree Ullal : On International Kulbinder, there is clearly room for improvement here, this is an area that will take time. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight in the quarter but it\u2019s an area we\u2019re making investments this year and we look to see the fruits of our labor in the next couple of years. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead, your line is open. Alex Henderson :  Thanks, just two data points. Could you just give us a headcount and what you think the tax rate could look like as we get closer to next year here? And then operationally I was wondering if you could give us an update on your thinking on two technical issues. One, what\u2019s going on with the customers added to this towards the BiDi adoption of 40 gig multimode versus the 100 gig single mode and second, obviously ACI has now been out for almost a year. I would assume that you\u2019ve been getting a lot of feedback on issues, whether there are challenges to actually using ACI and whether your customer base has finally gotten through the testing and evaluation process on that product? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Alex you asked three questions there. I\u2019ll part those and Kelyn is going to answer the first one. You asked about the employee count. We typically don\u2019t talk about specific numbers well. Kelyn Brannon :  We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t on a quarterly basis talk about specific numbers but the second part of your question was on tax. So as you know I indicated that we were at 30.5% effective tax rate. If I look out to Q4 on a non-GAAP type ETR, I would expected between 29% and 31% and on a GAAP ETR to be approximately 31% to 33%. If I think about next year and I make an assumption that my international revenue mix stays very similar to what it is in 2014, our tax rate will be very similar \u201815 to \u201814. Having said that is the R&D credit gets initiated in let\u2019s say 2015, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis that would have about 350 basis points or 3.5% impact on the ETR but you would see that if the R&D credit comes in, of course every high tech company out there will benefit in a very similar way. Does that give you what you need? Alex Henderson : Yes, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay and I\u2019m going to turn it to Andy for the buyback question and then I\u2019ll answer the ACI. Andy Bechtolsheim :  Great, so the Cisco BiDi Optics is a completely proprietary tech design that goes over duplex fiber for 40 gig multi-modes, maybe 80 meter range. Last quarter we introduced much superior optics, which we call the Universal 40 gig optics, which has three significant advantages. Number one, it has the longer reach over multi-modes, 150 meters or more. Second its standard space. It uses the 40 gig LR for standard. But the best part is you can actually use it with both multi-mode and single-mode, which is why we call it universal so the customer can make a choice, how to deploy it, initially multi-mode, going forward single-mode. So we do believe this is a much better solution and there really is no other advantage to BiDi. Jayshree Ullal : And on the ACI question and I think I answered this before. We just had a 10th anniversary customer event and let me give you first the customer perspective, which is they\u2019re all pretty underwhelmed and many of them don\u2019t understand what exactly the problem is that one is trying to solve with it. Because what\u2019s really happening in the new datacenter market is you cannot really tailor and customize policy per application. The applications are pretty universal, whether it\u2019s workloads for big data or Hadoop or virtualization or VDI or high performance media transaction. And what customers really want is a universal workload architecture, with really good workflow visibility and good work load orchestration. So having an open non-vendor lock-in, non-proprietary and highly programmable underlay and infrastructure has been fundamental. This has been Arista's mission. This is what we provide in our products, and we have the right APIs to work with different types of overlays, whether they are controllers, that are single function devices or more broader network management devices. So quite frankly we have not seen any enthusiastic reception of ACI. It\u2019s possible that we are not witnessing the typical traditional enterprise customer that maybe interested in ACI. But given it's been a year, the traction and the competitive nature of it versus the Arista has been minimal. One must also understand there's a difference between announcing it and shipping it. I think while it\u2019s been a year since it's been announced, it probably hasn\u2019t been shipping for more than a quarter. So it\u2019s possible it\u2019s also been too early. Alex Henderson : The last part of that question was, if they had finished evaluating it and are now making decisions. Jayshree Ullal : I can\u2019t really answer that because I haven\u2019t seen examples of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is open. Mark Sue :  I am trying to get to map out historically how networking companies have historically seen success in the U.S. and then subsequent growth overseas. So perhaps Jayshree, the sequence of opportunities and the replication of datacenter wins overseas, since they are several years behind us in the U.S. and how do you see the length of the run rate, recognizing you're making investments now. And what that -- when you win datacenter Telco deals over here, how that portends to our Arista wins over there? Jayshree Ullal : I think it\u2019s fair to characterize that one of the reasons our international business growth can improve better is because we\u2019re doing so well in the U.S. Our growth in U.S. is so good, it\u2019s sort of hiding and shadowing any contributions we make internationally. But if you actually parse our international business like I\u2019ve had a chance to do, we are being well received in the more developed countries. So for example if we look in Europe, well received in United Kingdom, Germany, Nordics, Netherland, those are typically the places. In Asia I would point to Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Japan as three examples. So you would expect us to invest here and do much better than we\u2019re doing even now in these countries next year and the year after. Having said that I think as you rightly pointed out, the international risk aversion to new technologies in some of these intentional countries and I think the success of the U.S. will naturally help in followers internationally. So I believe our timing and our investment is appropriate right now. It isn\u2019t really missed opportunity but we expect to see the fruits of our labor in the next one to three years. Mark Sue : And then separately just on the lock up, we're less than one month away before the official explorations, just thinking behind the early lock up. Jayshree Ullal : I\u2019ll explain it then I\u2019ll turn it over to Kelyn for further. There are two complaints we received during our IPO offering and beyond, which is we didn\u2019t have enough shares on the slope and there was tremendous volatility on our stock. We believe by the leasing the lock up, we can address for our investors both of those concerns and we took a longer term view on this. We also believe that we\u2019re helping some of our long-term employees, many of who have been here much more than five years, especially our rank and file employees, please note that none of the senior officers or directors or executives and large shareholders will be selling. So we wanted to make sure that there was enough time in the tax year for both investors to invest in Arista and for employees to have some liquidity. Kelyn you want to add to that? Kelyn Brannon :  When I think about the employee base and we enter into Q4, the lock up would have expired on December 2nd and the trading would have begun on December 3rd. It really only provides a trading day for our employee base and our shareholders that have been subject to this lock up to trade before the blackout period begins on December 15th. So by this slightly early release, we\u2019re allowing our employees, not employees, but our rank and file to have the opportunity to have an additional 15 days of trading before we go into the black out period. Operator :  Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes :  Jayshree, can you comment on your partnerships, particularly VMware. How is it going so far and when do you expect it to be material and how that develops. And then one follow up is, with EMC now taking in the VCE, is there a potential that you could do some business with them, within their converged infrastructure, when perhaps it was previously all Cisco all the time. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Ben. I would characterize our VMware partnership as very strong, both on the engineering side and now more recently on the go-to-market side. Most people think that it is only an NSX integration with the prior Nicira acquisition, but it actually goes well beyond that for a lot of the ESX and market leadership that VMware has and server virtualization with vCenter and vSphere. So we actually have multiple touch points with VMware in NSX, ESX [indiscernible], and we continue to drive further standards in technology with them. In terms of go to market, it\u2019s too early to call material revenue, but we are seeing a lot of customer activity between the two sales teams, tremendous synergy and it\u2019s also being very welcomed by our customers who are looking for building that best of breed cloud stack and they don\u2019t want to do it with each side individually themselves. With sort of leads to second question, which is converged systems. I think the data of converged systems coming from one vendor and then settling for mediocrity is changing to more best of breed storage, scale out storage, best of breed network virtualization and best of breed programmable networking. So we are optimistic about working with a number of storage vendors. EMC has a lot of new announcements coming that we work closely with, as well as other scale out storage partners based on flash NAND scale out SDN storage software. Operator :  Your next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ehud Gelblum :  A couple of questions. Kelyn, a clarification first, can you give us a sense at least of what the services breakout is from product. I know your revenue historically has been pretty much all product. There are some services but its small compared to other companies. Just give us sense as to whether it has gone up or gone down and do you expect -- where is that just percentage wise and gives us a sense, if you think it stays that way. Then on your large customer Microsoft, that was again a 10% customer. The year progressing as you had thought with the lumpiness hasn\u2019t come down in Q1. You\u2019re hunting it may go up a little bit in Q4. As we look at next year, should we be looking for dominant player like Microsoft had been in 2013 or do you think that balance continues out into next year.  And then two more things if I could. Kelyn, you had also -- appreciate the forecast on taxes what we should be looking for in taxes. If I remember right, there was some procedure that you were working on or maybe thinking about working on with respect to creating new tax structures internationally. With all the noise about tax inversions and either tax quote over the last quarter, did some of that change your thinking in terms of what you could up doing over the long-term. And then finally Jayshree, on -- again going back to the IPO, there was some talk and discussion about whether in a white box switch world, you\u2019d be willing to sell EOS as a standalone product to put on anyone else\u2019s hardware and just follow up thoughts you may have on whether that's still a possibility what it would take to get there. Appreciate. Kelyn Brannon : I\u2019m tired from listening to the question. Ben Reitzes : It took me a lot of time to come up with it. Kelyn Brannon : So I\u2019ll kind of walk through the first three in sprightly manner. So services today continues to be less intensive spend and so therefore we don\u2019t break it out. Services as you saw continue to grow. You saw the increase in differed revenue that talked about in my remarks. We expect it to continue to grow. It\u2019s going to cross over the 10% threshold at some point and we will break it out. We\u2019re very pleased with the new services attached that came through the quarter and our renewal. Moving on to Microsoft, as we mentioned in the Q2 call, we expect them to still be a 10% customer. We don\u2019t disclose quarterly. We will annually. We expect it through come to down to be in the teens. And as far as how we think about Microsoft this year, as how we were planning and how we discussed it during the IPO and in Q2, it\u2019s playing out as we had expected. As far as looking forward to next year and thinking about could someone else be a 10%, could Microsoft? As we look, one of the nice things that we\u2019re seeing is ever increasing customer base, that we have more volume customers today than we did last quarter or the quarter before and we continue to grow the base. And as we continue to grow the base, the nice impact or effect that has on us is that we don\u2019t suffer from the same type of customer concentration. Jayshree Ullal :  Okay. And finally Ehud to answer your question on white box, first of all let me go back to some history on the company since we're on our 10th anniversary. When Andy and Ken and David started the company, the initial thinking they had was that they would build a software only company. So EOS has always been architected as fundamentally a very highly resilient, highly available, highly programmable software and that\u2019s what the E in EOS tends for, extensible, right. Now what we found is that our customers were looking for us to provide that full integrated experience of software, silicon diversity with our Merchant Silicon, but we\u2019ve always had an abstraction layer that can work with different types of silicon and different types of hardware if we needed to, and if our customers demand that. We have basically brought forward customized components of that over time. For example our virtual EOS, or VEOS image is VM image, a Virtual Machine image that any customer can implement on the control plane. We\u2019ve been shipping that and we\u2019ve been improving that and this is something you can look at as basically a controlled plain white box experience that people want to play with our software. You will see us as we evolve EOS as a product, EOS as a platform, also more customizations, more APIs more SDKs and more ability for customers to build on top of it and this is something I alluded to last quarter with Facebook on the wedge example. A number of customers will take our version of EOS and customize it for a variety of their applications to get better application control. But I don\u2019t look at that as white box. I look at that as their custom box, but using EOS as a fundamental foundation. Kelyn Brannon :  And Ehud, I just realized that there was one question that you asked about our tax structure and our thoughts around that, and the recent announcement out of Ireland and our tax structure has been well in place since 2008 and there has not been any changes to that. In the announcement they talked about companies that do have the type of tax structure are grandfathered in until 2020. As we look at this, they did reemphasize again that the corporate tax rate of 12.5% in Ireland is not changing and so we continue to want to invest, both in A&L, our Irish subsidiary and just internationally and continue to grow our international business and there is not going to be any changes at this time in the short to near term as we think about our tax structure. Operator :  Your next question comes from Georgios Kyriakopoulos with SunTrust. Please go ahead, your line is open. Georgios Kyriakopoulos :  On the cloud guidance, the main question is how the ramp account look like in the absence of Microsoft growth? Can you give us a sense in what team we are, with this group collectively and if the ramp so far resemble the ramp you experienced with Microsoft and then more specifically, is there one or more of these accounts further that along with the Arista deployments and how much are they in the mix? Jayshree Ullal :  Thanks Georgios. So, obviously Microsoft is a high contributor to our growth and we continue to expect Microsoft by the way to be a 10% customer next year in 2015 as well. But having said that, clearly our growth and contribution and in fact equal or faster growth is coming from a number of major customers in all four verticals, including other cloud titans, tier 2 cloud providers, service providers and financials. While these are not as large in size like Microsoft, they\u2019re definitely growing equal or faster. Georgios Kyriakopoulos : Okay, great and then if I look back in the last two years, Arista grew sequentially in the March, quarter despite weak seasonality from service providers and overall January and February slow deployment activity among the customers. Now when I look ahead to your March quarter of 2015, should we expect bigger [ph] historical performance? Are you saying that the business normalizes to go customer spend in [indiscernible]? Jayshree Ullal : Georgios I\u2019m not smart enough to tell you how we\u2019ll do next quarter, let alone next year. But I can\u2019t say that Q1 tends to be seasonally our lowest quarter. We tend to be flat Q4 to Q1 or sometimes even down. Q2 and Q3 are about the same and then Q4 is usually our strongest quarter. This is the pattern we\u2019ve seen so far. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jess Lubert :  Question is also on 25 gig and 50 gig and now that Juniper, Cisco and others are developing solutions, do you believe you have any competitive advantage here that maybe enables you to gain shares as these solutions come to market. And then I was hoping to clarify on the lock up, if the release applied to the David Cheriton Trust or if they were still restricted at the moment? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Andy will take the first question on the 25 gig and then Kelyn on the lock up. Andy Bechtolsheim :  Yes, so the 25 gig look at vendor standard consortium came in to being early this year among companies who were all highly motivated to bring this type of solution to market as quickly as possible. So it is available in next generation Merchant Silicon. Having said that, unless you were very insightful and we\u2019re planning ahead a long time for your ASIC upgrades, you\u2019re not going to see that in any non-merchant implementation anytime soon. So this will create somewhat of a split in the market between the merchants [indiscernible] has the ability to support 25 gig and 50 gig legacy switches that will not have that capability. Jess Lubert : Is it your thought that these other vendors are not planning to leverage the merchant silicon? If I look at some of the high end switches coming out from Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, they\u2019re also using some of the same merchant silicon. Is there any reason to believe that they wouldn\u2019t be move again the same path? Andy Bechtolsheim : I didn\u2019t say that. What I said is that anybody using the merchant silicon would have access to these 25 gig and 50 gig modes. However legacy E6 such as proprietary switch designs did not anticipate this, will not see 25 gig anytime soon. Kelyn Brannon : On to your question on the lock up, so again, I just want to reemphasize again, this partial release does not apply to any executive officers, any directors, any employees that\u2019s entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or non-employee stock holders. So this partial release is not available to the David Cheriton Trust. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : I had two questions. First Jayshree, you upfront mentioned strength in the chassis, which is the 7500E X series line. I was just trying to understand is the mix between modular platforms and fixed platforms changing for you towards the modular platform side and did you talk about price before trends in those two segments. Then more broadly, and if you look at 2015, this year was a year of some transitions and competitive product side as well as 10 gigabit option accelerating. How are you looking at 2015 for the market itself recognizing of course you\u2019re not guiding to revenues at this point. Jayshree Ullal : You and I have talked about this before. The mix of modular Spine to leave has remained relatively the same. What I would add to that is the 7500E acceptance has been very good. What\u2019s very clear to us Andy, Hugh [ph], Ken and the team have done some real world and simulation testing? And this is the only platform in the market where 10 gig, 40 gig, 100 gig at adequate density, poor density capability in the small footprint and the right size of buffers, almost 1,000x better buffering than anybody else and people think large buffers need large latency Actually large buffers need better application latency for your customers. So I think the acceptance of the 7,500, particularly in Spine particularly in 10, 40, 100, and particularly in Big Data applications by our customers has been heartwarming for us. We also are seeing this climb in 7300 and they really are taking two different market segments in the chassis and Spine world. In terms of price support, no major changes quarter-over-quarter but we have always seen changes year-over-year. We continue to aggressively offer price supports and AFCs that can be in the range of 10% to 20% lower every year and you can see that in the 10 gigabit Ethernet price support trends. We see 10 gigabit Ethernet, especially 10 gig BC [ph] as these options for a couple of rack servers and leaf connectivity and the spines are certainly adopting more 40 gig and 100 gigs. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : And 2015 broadly Jayshree, how do you think about that? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. When I was saying what I did, I meant that for 2015. We are not seeing major change in 10 gig being the leaf of choice and 40 and 100 being the uplink and spine of choice. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein :  Jayshree, if I'm looking at the numbers correctly and I apologize if you said this earlier, but it looks like your revenue in the Asia-Pacific region was down by about $6 million. If I look at the trend line, I would have expected it to be over 10 million in terms of the delta. One would have expected what you actually put up. Is that a function? Were there a couple of major customers that contributed a significant piece to the $14 million you did in June, they step back just volatility, or can you tell us what\u2019s going on there? And then I have got a couple of others. Jayshree Ullal : If we did -- business actually did quite well. But as you know we also attribute our global customer footprint to the geographies and that\u2019s where source. So some of our larger providers, titans will purchase for a datacenter located in Asia one time or Latin America another time or Europe a third or U.S. So that\u2019s what effected the mix and that\u2019s the change you saw between Q2 and Q3. We haven\u2019t seen a significant decline or increase for that matter in [APJ] business, we\u2019re doing okay but we can do a lot better. But that particular change was due to mix or specific customers deployed to their centers. We are more beholden to where the datacenters are located in terms of purchase. Paul Silverstein : And then on Microsoft, if I understood your comments correctly, it sounds like there is a change in your outlook. I think previously you've been forecasting or expecting Microsoft to be relatively flat. I thought I heard you say earlier in the call that you now expect it to be -- or that you expect it to be up, albeit, use the rest of your customer mix for stronger growth not unexpectedly. But is that in fact a change in what you\u2019re seeing or what you expect from Microsoft? Jayshree Ullal : No change, I was simply highlighting the fact that they were very strong in Q1 and obviously as a percentage of our revenue they are coming down every quarter, from the 22% in Q1 down and we expect that to continue. However Q4 for every customer, including Microsoft tends to be a stronger quarter. Paul Silverstein :  And then two quick others. Kelyn, I know you don\u2019t typically break it out but can you give us some insight on the revenue contribution from new customers versus existing customers? I think last year was running about 85%-15% existing versus new. Can you update that? Kelyn Brannon :  We will try and give you some annual guidance but we don\u2019t do that on the quarter basis. But I think we continue to derive a strong amount of revenue from our top 50 and top 100 customers. Is it 85%? Probably not that high, because our new customer acquisition is also growing at a remarkable rate. But we don\u2019t do the breakdowns by quarter Alex. Paul Silverstein :  All right. And one last question if I may. I've got to ask you, but I know Doug Gourlay and couple of other seniors -- somewhat senior execs left recently, and I trust or would hope that the function of IPO and folks have been working hard, wanting to cash out, but can you share with us any thoughts? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Absolutely. We lost a couple of good talented executives this quarter, who have been with us five years Doug Gourlay, formally VP of Marketing and then more recently our VP of Systems Engineering looking for [indiscernible], our Senior VP, as well as David Watkins who was running our EMEA region for Mark Smith. And look, our attrition is extremely low. It\u2019s in single digits and we fully expect that some individuals who had tremendous financial success and also wish to move on to other things -- in the case of Dave, he's going to be retiring. In the case of Doug, he is resting for now but I\u2019m sure he will explore life beyond Arista. So we wish both of them very well and we would rather they explore other things than rest and risk and I think it was extremely friendly and amicable parting in both cases and a natural part of the evolution of the Company. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Genovese :  Do you have the appreciable amount of revenues from any verticals outside of your main four and is there any quantification you could give us there. And on a related note what about [VAR] expansion as you move from more direct to also a VAR channel. Can you give us any update on how many VARs you added on a quarter or any other metrics that we could use to track that? Jayshree Ullal :  Thanks Michael. We do not have -- outside the four verticals, since we lost a lot of our customers into the high-tech enterprise, there is not one I can really specifically identify or callout this quarter. So the answer to your question is no, there is no particular one to single out. And in terms of VARs, this is an area that Mark Smith has been sowing the seeds and putting some ground work. We typically pull through almost 100% through distributions of VARs and resellers but a lot of our selling efforts have been direct to date because of the complexity of our technology and intimacy our customers require directly with us quite honestly, and frankly for the large purchases they do. We do believe in 2015 and beyond we will be selectively working with value added resellers worldwide and really taking two tiers of distribution. One is what we call the elite VARs, where we work closely with them and they would be an extension of our sale organization. And the other would be broader distribution for fulfillment like we do today. So we expect then -- perhaps in one of our wildcard topics we'll actually cover this in more details when we're ready, but definitely an area of strategy and expansion and opportunity Arista. Michael Genovese :  Okay. And then finally from me, looking at the December lock up, could you tell us whether 10b5-1 plans have been established for the senior executives and any detail you can give on that, and how should we think about the share count as we move into 2015 and the first half of that year, second half of the year? How should we model share count? Jayshree Ullal :  So if we think about the 10b5-1 plans, I will tell you that a number of our executives have entered into 10b5-1 plans and we of course are supporting that and encouraging that. As I think about the share count for Q4, given the lock up volatility and stock price, thinking about the treasury stock method and how we calculate it and thinking through exercisable options that get exercised and then are not out of the fully diluted calculation, if I was making a range I\u2019d say share count would be for Q4 between 70 million and 71 million. In this particular quarter because of the lock ups expiring, there is more moving parts in it. Michael Genovese :  And we think about the share count obviously continue to move up. So by the time we got to Q4 \u201815, I know you don\u2019t guide that for out, but do you want to give us any goal posts around share count a year out. Unidentified Company Representative :  Not at this time. We\u2019ll address that in our Q1 call. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Northland. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal :  Yes, thanks everyone very much. I was going to ask you about revenue growth trajectory a little bit as well. Obviously being probably north of 50% is a great number to be at. At the same time I think that we can see that the revenue growth trajectory has slowed quite a bit from 2013 and 2014. Could you perhaps talked to us a little bit about what sorts of things are underlying, what you think the growth trajectory may look like going forward and maybe Microsoft for example being a sizable chunk of your revenue is sort of flattish and that\u2019s driving things down, maybe that you\u2019re expecting a big pick up in Europe. So how are you feeling about how the trajectory has been and what should we look for going forward. And then I have a follow up as well. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal :  When I look at the revenue trajectory Jeff, I think what you're really seeing here is the lone large numbers right. We obviously can\u2019t grow on a base of what\u2019s going to be a $500 million year the way we did when we were $250 million or $300 million. So I think you\u2019ve seen a natural decline in percentages because of the large growth, but you\u2019re not seeing any fundamental changes in the fact that Arista is growing much faster than the market growth of our segment and Arista\u2019s customer acquisition and penetration into these customers continues to be very strong. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into any particular vertical or our growth rate itself, barring any kind of recession or crisis or change in market conditions, I would say our growth is well above the average of our market segment. Jeff Kvaal :  Okay, thank you, that\u2019s helpful and then Kelyn, my follow up is for you. I think last quarter you moved a little bit of differed -- product deferred revenue from not deferred into the actual revenue line. Is there -- are there any other similar movements underfoot in this quarter? Thank you. Kelyn Brannon :  And as I said in my remarks, deferred revenue is primarily made up a service deferred revenue. And so no, there has not been any movement of -- there has not been movement of product deferred revenue into revenue. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open. Simon Leopold :  Hey, thank you very much. A couple of hopefully relatively simple questions. One is can you tell us the number of shares that would be available for this early lock up exploration that are held by the employees. That\u2019s the first one. Second one, and I\u2019m sorry if there was an update that I missed but just wondering if there is any status you can offer on the lawsuit with OptumSoft, even any insight on what kind of legal expenses you\u2019re incurring? And then the last thing, I was hoping to get a better understanding of what you did discuss earlier was the lower operating expenses in the quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re having a little bit of trouble in terms of hiring people of the quality you\u2019d like to hire and I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is how does that change? How do you manage to find the people and hire to have the resource you need to grow the Company? Thank you. Kelyn Brannon :  So, I\u2019ll take the first one Jayshree on the number of shares. So, if we look at the release and if you go into the 8-K that filed, we have detail there of the exact numbers, but we will release 3.7 million shares of common stock and 1.8 million of vested option on 1111 for a total of $5.5 million. And again I want to remind everyone that this as a release of only kind of 50% of what that holding is for employees only. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, and I\u2019m going to answer your second two questions. You asked on OptumSoft. There was not much to discuss there. So there's no real change in status. The trial is still in discovery mode and the hearing date has been set for 2016. So there isn't a quarterly report really. No news is no news. Simon Leopold : And the legal expenses have been as expected? Kelyn Brannon : Our expenses have been as expected and they are included in our pro-forma numbers and have not been pulled out. So there is just really no news there. Simon Leopold : Okay, and then the last part, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, on the last part on us having difficulty in hiring, I would not say we're having difficulty hiring but I would say we are holding the quality of our hires and that bar very high. And also some of our prototype expenses are moving out based on our new product dates and introduction. So it's that combination that\u2019s contributing to our expenses being lower than we are planning. So in terms of hires, some of the things we\u2019ve done as a post-IPO company is move away from stock option to more [RSUs] to better adjust. We have also for the first time instituted a bonus plan for 2014 that we\u2019ll obviously continue into 2015. We are looking in engineering to expand our geographic locations beyond our headquarters in Santa Clara. Today we\u2019ve locations in Canada and India but we will expand beyond that as well and stay tuned. And in terms of sales and marketing, we are aggressively hiring, but we have always favored experienced, high quality hires over just sheer coverage models. So we'll continue to deepen our four verticals, as well as internationally and really do smart sales and marketing. Simon Leopold : And just to follow up on that very briefly, your guidance does imply that operating expenses are growing significantly faster than sales at the midpoint. I just want to verify that, that\u2019s your expectation for the December quarter? Kelyn Brannon : We haven\u2019t executed as well to this -- to the top line Simon, but I can\u2019t promise that will be our actual. Jayshree Ullal : So Simon, as I said in my remarks, we have really kicked off the software [indiscernible]. There are other ancillary things that will be falling through G&A as we continue to be ready to be SoCs compliant. We\u2019re continuing to make investments in our ERP system, not only for SoCs, but also to prepare ourselves to be able to scale as we continue to grow our top line. So you will see OpEx growing as we continue down the path of getting completely compliant and being a public company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ittai Kidron :  Many of my questions have been asked. I do want to ask though about the gross margins. They have fallen to where you expected them to fall longer term, that\u2019s correct. But can you talk a little bit about the disparity in gross margins between large deals and smaller deals? I'm just a little bit concerned that you implied in your gross margins that large deals -- your gross margins are much, much lower and as you start becoming a bigger component of your customers and they start relying more and more on you, is there a risk that that gross margin range starts drifting down even lower going forward. Jayshree Ullal : First of all gross margins, we\u2019ve been predicting will come down and you guys didn\u2019t believe us and I guess we finally did show you we can come down in gross margins. So there are two reasons our gross margins came down. One was the customer mix and the other was overhead in operating COGS that Kelyn will cover. I\u2019ll talk about the first one. There is no question that our gross margins and our pricing to customers is priced to volume. And there is a difference between a customer who buys a few units and a customer who buys thousands, if not millions of ports, right. So there is a delta. However the delta alone does not contribute to our gross margin. What happened this quarter was a combination of both that customer mix, as well as our overheads and both were equal contributors to our decline in gross margins. Kelyn you want to add to that? Kelyn Brannon : No that\u2019s absolutely correct. So again it was the customer mix and the volume discounts, which we\u2019re very pleased to see. We\u2019re expanding foot print. And then secondly we did have some increased manufacturing overhead that we absorbed into our cost. Jayshree Ullal : And as I've always said, when we\u2019re in market growth phase, we are absolutely going to make some tradeoffs for gross margin in favor of market share. We will do that in a thoughtful and balanced and sensible fashion, but we will absolutely do that. Ittai Kidron : And second, just following up on Simon\u2019s question regarding hiring. I understand that\u2019s you\u2019re being selective and as you should. I guess the question is with the stock being at $80, from a stock option standpoint, do you find those sales being somewhat limited in how generous you can be in bringing in the right talent? Is hiring suddenly becoming very expensive for you just because of where your stock is right now? Jayshree Ullal : I think we hire a different profile of folks, who are less about the stock options and more about joining a company that isn't risky. So it\u2019s a different profile of still very capable people and who see the upside and the growth and the future over the next 10 years can be very exciting and can be very rewarding as well, both for their career and financially. But you bring up a good point that at stock options at $80, we are less likely to grant stock options and more likely to have base salary, bonuses and RSUs. Operator : Your next question comes from John Lucia with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Lucia : I have two questions. The first one is on international. You guys noted lower deployments internationally by U.S. based global customers caused weakness internationally and I just want to understand why you think that\u2019s happening? What\u2019s driving that and also what kind of customer concentration there was with those lower deployments internationally? Was it just a handful of global customers that didn\u2019t deploy or was it a boarder issue? Jayshree Ullal : I\u2019ll take another stab at that answer. So if you think about it as our global or U.S. based global customers deploy, they\u2019re not going to necessarily consistently deploy every quarter in Singapore or Japan. They\u2019re going to deploy in a datacenter in one particular geographic region, and then they\u2019re going to deploy in another geographic region. So we really haven\u2019t seen -- if you think about what we saw was a significant deployment that happened in APJ last quarter but if you look at our overall international mix this quarter to previous quarters and look at that trend, we still run around that 80-20 split and have consistently been there. And again, our percentage -- our international revenue as a percent of revenue gets overshadowed by the rapid growth of what\u2019s happening in the U.S. and the top line there. But has not been absolutely no deterioration in our international business. Unidentified Analyst : And then my second question, you guys noted the quarter was well balanced from a vertical perspective, but can you speak to where you are seeing the most growth from new customers? Last quarter you indicated some good traction with the high-tech in particular. Could you just update there? That would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal :  We just see growth across all four verticals. If there's one I would want to point out, it would be service providers and Tier 2 cloud providers. We saw good growth there. Chuck Elliott :  All right. This concludes the Arista Q2 2014 earnings call. I\u2019d like to say thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator :  Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; Kelyn Brannon, Arista's Chief Financial Officer; and Marc Taxay, Arista Vice President and General Counsel.  This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the Company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2015 fiscal year and industry innovation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, in our most recent Form 10-Q and recent prospectus and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.  These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter and an overall impressive year of $584.1 million in revenue with a 61.7% annual growth. Consistent with prior quarters, customer demand and our new products drove results that exceeded consensus estimates. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 81% of our sales in Q4. We are investing to improve our global expansion, including recent hires of our EMEA's and APJ sales leaders. Q4 revenue grew 51% year-over-year to a record $173.5 million, driven by our flagship EOS-based 7000 Series platform. We've recorded the largest quarterly revenue ever achieved as an independent switching company. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 67.4%, resulting in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 as we grew profitably in our fast-paced and dynamic industry. Our customers were balanced across 4 major verticals, proving our broadened adoption into mainstream enterprises. In terms of customer concentration, Microsoft, our only top 10% customer, reduced from 22% of 2013 revenue to 15% in 2014.  This quarter, we once again differentiated ourselves with key software innovations in our architecture. We announced our flagship EOS+ with a single common image for virtual and physical instances. The EOS+ platform delivers radical and foundational improvements over legacy approaches, with our multi-process shared state model, SDK toolkit and vEOS, a virtual machine version of our software. Arista EOS provides at least 6 types of programmability to take advantage of prebuilt and custom EOS applications. Meaningful integration with our technology partners ranging from A10 Networks, Ansible, Aruba, Cloudera, Nuage, Palo Alto Network, Puppet Labs, Pure Storage, Red Hat, Splunk, VMTurbo, VMware and Zscaler is an important hallmark of our EOS+ solution.  We further illustrated our EOS+ use cases with endorsements from 2 of our most strategic customers, Microsoft and Facebook. As I reflect on our first experiences as a public company, I'd like to highlight some key milestones we have achieved in our short history. We have now shipped over 3 million cumulative 10, 40 and 100 gigabits Ethernet ports with a base of more than 3,000 customers. We believe that we have gained market share in this segment throughout the 2014 year and this quarter.  We forged a strategic relationship with VMware. Both companies were named as the top 2 visionaries in the Gartner Magic Quadrant of February 2014. Arista pioneered the 25-gigabit Ethernet and 50-gigabit Ethernet consortium with Broadcom, Google and Microsoft as initial founding members. We introduced the industry's only 100-gigabit Ethernet 1RU leaf big buffer switch, the 7280E, for both content and storage applications. Arista was named #15 in Glass Door's Top 50 Best Small and Medium-sized Companies to Work For and we have now crossed over 1,000 employees, doubling in the past 2 years. Many of you had inquired about the Cisco lawsuit. I would like to now turn it over to our General Counsel, Marc Taxay, for a legal update followed by Kelyn Brannon, our CFO, who will review our financial highlights. Marc? Marc Taxay : Thank you, Jayshree. Before I get into the details, I'd like to use this time to briefly discuss how we view the litigation. Cisco has filed several complaints against Arista, 2 in the ITC and 2 in the Northern District of California, so they can really be broken down into 2 different disputes. The patent case involves patents covering a number of different software features and functionality. We believe these cases are really about defending our rights, the EOS innovations that we've developed from a clean sheet of paper over the last 10 years. The copyright case relates to the Command Line Interface, which is used by customers to configure our switches. We view this as an issue of open standards, in reach of copyright protection, which we believe affects the entire industry. We've hired an excellent legal team to represent us : Wilson Sonsini, Fish & Richardson and Keker & Van Nest. And we are very confident in our strategy. With that, let me get into the details.  On December 19, 2014, Cisco filed the 2 ITC complaints against Arista for alleged violations of Section 337 of Tariff Act, based upon the importation of our products into the United States. The ITC instituted 2 investigations, designated as a 944 and 945 investigations. The 2 investigations involve the same 12 patents that is subject of the district court case. They were simply split into two 6-patent cases in the ITC. The initial determination date for the 944 investigation is scheduled for January 27, 2016, with a target date for completion of May 27, 2016. Based on the current schedule, we expect that the hearing will be sometime in October 2015.  As for the 945 investigation, the initial determination date is now scheduled for April 26, 2016 with a target date for completion of August 26, 2016. The hearing is currently set to take place in November of this year. In a nutshell, we do not expect any ITC decisions in these investigations until mid-2016. Regarding the merits, we'll point you to our responses to the 2 ITC complaints, which were filed on February 11, 2015 and we denied the claims asserted against us.  In addition to the ITC investigation, Cisco filed 2 complaints against Arista in the Northern District of California on December 5, 2014. In the first case, Cisco asserted claims of patent infringement with respect to the same 12 patents. Because of that overlap, the case has been staved pending resolution in the ITC. Consequently, there will be no activity in this case until the ITC cases are completely resolved through appeal. This could be sometime in 2017 depending upon the ITC schedules.  In the second case, Cisco alleged that our use of certain CLI commands infringe various aspects of the copyrighted works and, further, that our products infringed 2 additional Cisco patents. We do not yet have a schedule for this case. Our first case management conference is likely to be sometime this spring and we should have a better idea at that time what the schedule will be.  On the merits, we filed a response in February 13, denying the claims asserted against us. In summary, this lawsuit is going to be a multiyear battle and we intend to litigate this in the courts, not in the media. We don't plan to blog on every routine-procedural matter. If blogging won cases, we'd blog, we intend to win. Ultimately, our primary focus is on the continued supply of our award-winning products to our customers.  I will now turn the call over to Kelyn Brannon, our CFO. Kelyn Brannon : Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I walk through our financial results and guidance, I'd like to note that, except for revenue numbers that are GAAP, our financial numbers are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation of selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. We reported record revenue of $173.5 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase from Q3 2014. Gross margins for Q4 was 67.4% up from 65.2% in the prior quarter and down slightly from 67.6% the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase was primarily caused by a reduction in inventory overhead costs and favorable customer mix. Our gross margin will continue to fluctuate up and down from quarter-to-quarter due primarily to customer mix, seasonality of our business and product mix. We expect our gross margins to average in the low to mid-60% range in the long-term, but will fluctuate above and below this range on a quarterly basis. Turning to operating expenses. R&D spending for Q4 was $39.7 million, increasing sequentially from $31.9 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $29.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increases reflect headcount additions and higher bonus expenses, in addition to increase development activity for new products.  Sales and marketing spending for Q4 was $23.1 million, increasing sequentially from $18.6 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $16.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase reflects additional sales and sales engineer headcount, higher bonuses and commissions attributable to our strong revenue growth and an increased marketing activity to support our customer base. G&A spending for Q4 was $7.2 million, decreasing sequentially from $9 million in the prior quarter and an increase from $5.7 million in the year-ago quarter. In Q3, we recorded an additional corporate bonus to G&A that was subsequently allocated in Q4 across other departments, which largely caused the sequential quarter decline.  Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $47.1 million, increasing sequentially from $42 million in the prior quarter and an increase of $26.3 million in the corresponding period in 2013.  Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 19.1% triggered by the enactment of 2014 R&D tax credit during Q4 and tax structure reorganization efforts. Net income for Q4 was $37.3 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared with a net income of $17.5 million or fully diluted earnings of $0.27 per share in Q4 2013. We doubled our net income to $105.5 million or fully diluted earnings of $1.54 per share compared to net income of $52.6 million or fully diluted earnings of $0.84 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet. We had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $449.4 million at the end of Q4. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for 2014 was $114.5 million and $101.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2014 totaled $13.1 million and were primarily related to purchases of development, testing and manufacturing equipment. Accounts receivable was $97 million, an increase from the prior quarter of $84.1 million. DSOs remained steady at 51 in Q4.  Current and noncurrent deferred revenue was $106.5 million, an increase of $28.8 million over the prior quarter and primarily resulted from new service agreements and renewals. Inventory was $80.5 million up from $62.6 million in the prior quarter, yielding terms of nearly 3. The increase primarily resulted from increased volumes to support our revenue growth. Let me now move to our guidance. I'd like to emphasize that although our rapid revenue growth has minimized the impact of seasonal factors, Q1 has historically been a seasonally weak quarter followed by stronger sequential revenue growth in Q2 through Q4. We expect this trend to continue in 2015. And as a result, for the first quarter of 2015, we expect our revenue to remain flat from Q4 and have set a target of $164 million to $172 million, which represents 40% to 47% growth year-over-year.  Gross margin is anticipated to be in the 63% to 66% range based on forecasted customer mix and seasonality and we anticipate operating margins in the range of 22% to 25%. Starting in Q1 '15 and subsequent quarters, the above guidance excludes legal costs related to the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, which has been removed from our non-GAAP results. We anticipate that these costs will range between $5 million to $7 million for Q1 '15. Non-GAAP effective tax rate is forecasted to be in the 30% to 32% range. We estimate DSO will be in the low 50s and inventory turns remaining around 3 per year And as a reminder, Arista will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jayshree Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Kelyn, and thank you, Marc. In summary, we've had a momentous 2014 with many memorable metrics. We have done this as a team with dedicated focus : focus on pioneering innovation, focus on customer dedication and focus on Arista's results with the right values. It's a cocktail of doing the genuinely right thing that we call in Arista, the Arista way. It means we thrive on fair competition and we welcome that. Our customers though, do not come to us for old school legacy systems or copied code. They seek open innovation. They are embracing Arista for our disruptive programming software model to transition to the new cloud initiatives.  So let me be clear. The lawsuit has not impacted our business. In fact, I am energized by our unwavering customer acceptance and the momentum ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : Your growth rate seems to suggest a meaning -- significant market share gain. Do you feel now that you're seeing a narrowing of the field when it comes to high-end switching 10, 40, 100? Who are you gaining market share from? And it doesn't seem the lawsuit has any impact to your bookings trends. Maybe if you could give us some qualitative trends of why you are still continuing to gain share. And also, lastly, just on the white box switches, how the needle might be swinging the other way from the initial hard base [ph]. Jayshree Ullal : Right. Thank you, Mark. I think when you have such a large total available market opportunity, as you know, the market for 10, 40 and 100 gigabit is $6.9 billion in 2014, according to Dell'Oro/Crehan Research, going to $13 billion in 5 years, it is very possible for Arista to gain market share with sheer execution. And that's what you're seeing here. With a disruptive product, with a software that no one else has, and the customers really wanting to move to SDN and cloud, we're gaining share on our own merits, is the number one. We don't have to take share from anyone. We're gaining on our own merits, is the strong message I'd leave you with. We do believe large dominant players are likely to lose share and are losing share but, independent of that, Arista's execution and market share gains are based on Arista. In terms of white box, I think it's important to understand that whether it's white box, blue box, SDN, Merchant Silicon, whatever you want to call it, this market is still very small. It's a $259 million market estimated by Dell'Oro in 2014. So it's -- again, it's another form factor. Once the market gets big enough for Arista, we'll consider participating in it when we have customers who want it. Arista is not participating in the blade switch market, which is a form factor we're not in. Arista is not participating in the virtual switch market which, again, is a form factor we're not in. But when we see a meaningful market and we see our customers wanting for us to be in that, then absolutely -- to date, that $250 million is largely a captive market in engineering-driven companies. Mark Sue : That's helpful. And Jayshree, lastly, now that you're past your 10-year anniversary, do you feel that customers are considering the networking requirements as more of a 2-player environment? Is it forming in that way from your customers' view? Jayshree Ullal : I think absolutely. We've seen that real change in 2014 where much like the service providers where Juniper became the alternative service provider, Arista is clearly being viewed as the alternative innovator in data center and cloud. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Jayshree, just a couple of questions for you. First one is, which of your verticals drove the strength in the quarter and then looking out into your guidance? And then secondly, you said that you're not seeing any impact on the business from the Cisco lawsuit. Can you just expand on that? Is it that customers are not bringing that up as a potential risk? Or is it that they are, but you're successful in navigating around that and able to overcome their concerns? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Thanks, Simona. The first question, we saw very good balance across our 4 verticals which, as you know, are high-tech enterprise, financials, service providers and tier 2 providers and the cloud titans. And in fact, I would especially call your attention to the fact that we feel good that we're entering the mainstream enterprise adoption, but all 4 verticals did well for us in Q4. In terms of the lawsuit, initially we had customers coming to me that they understand that this is because of our success. Literally, quotes from different folks like, \"If they can't innovate, they litigate.\" So no question that they want us to continue to innovate and indemnify their contracts but, frankly, the investors are more worried about it than our customers. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hopefully you can hear me well. I want to talk about competition. Juniper launched a software/hardware desegregation strategy with products and we see standalone products from Dell that are separating again the hardware from software. We see the software companies in this space and then Cisco is very aggressive with pricing. So how do you see the market shaping up first because of Cisco's aggressive pricing? How do you deal with it? And second, the software/hardware desegregation and the fact that you are still integrated software/hardware? Jayshree Ullal : Tal, those are both very good questions. In terms of pricing, we have seen a consistent aggression from our competition on prices. And generally, there are 2 or 3 aspects to our price. First of all, there's the CapEx price where sometimes our competitors will often bundle it and give it for 0, right? It's hard to compete against 0. But I think customers have recognized that their total price is really the operations costs and the total cost of ownership, what the OpEx price is. And over there, Arista does particularly well. So even if CapEx is about the same or we're lower or we're higher, people are valuing the programmability and order provisioning and tuning in a significant way that we're not manual and that it doesn't require large amounts of staff and that we can provide that cloud-like experience that they're looking for in all their applications and storage as well is really playing. And Arista EOS is a key hallmark to differentiate us from a price point of view. In terms of bundling of software and hardware, as I said before, Arista, this is a well-known secret actually, started out as a software company and majority of our resources is still software. Out of our R&D organization strength, over 90% is software. So when you look at our EOS+ announcement, it is all about virtual images of software, it's about software development toolkit, it's about customizing and aligning that capability, so we're not afraid to jointly work with customers and offering programmability to our software. If they want to build their hardware, if they want us to run on a white box, we're open to that as well. We've always said we are. We are waiting to see that market develop, and as and when customers want that, we will absolutely offer yet another form factor and business model. We view that as another member of our portfolio, so not a big deal to us. Tal Liani : Got it. And what about the margin and expense outlook? We see more competition now than 2 years ago. And you mentioned on the call, and we know it, you don't do blade, you don't -- you're not into virtual switches, there are certain parts of orchestration maybe you also don't do, so are you -- do you feel the need to increase expenses and go after these market? Or do you think that where you are is where you're going to stay for the next few years, let's say? Jayshree Ullal : Right. With a $584 million revenue out of a $7 billion market going to $10 billion, $11 billion, I think focus is important. So we're definitely not doing blade switches. We believe that footprint belongs to server vendors. We're definitely not doing virtual switches. We work with the OpenStack community, we work with VMware, we work with NSX, we work with Nuage, so we don't see that we should go into markets and technologies that others have strength in, we want to complement that. And we have plenty of room to grow to become $1 billion or $2 billion company with that large market. At the same time, we do not preclude adjacencies. If it makes sense with our software and technology to expand into markets that are more natural where we can be differentiated, we will absolutely consider that in the next 1 to 3 years. Operator : And your next question comes the line of Erik Suppiger at JMP. Erik Suppiger : Two questions. First off, on the gross margin guidance, are you feeling better about the gross margins? Is that an uptick from where you've been in the past in terms of the guidance for 63% to 67%? Jayshree Ullal : Erik, I'm glad you commented on this and you noticed this. We are feeling good about modeling our gross margins so that we understand it better. However, we do believe -- there's a reason why we gave a wider range this time than normal, that we do believe that our gross margin is quite affected by mix. When we had large volume cloud titans and they're not as balanced, we can swing the gross margin down since they drive on that volume. When we have smaller volumes and more enterprise, or customers who aren't buying as much quantity, then our gross margin increases. So blending the 2 and predicting that mix continues to be a learning experience for us. Kelyn, do you want to comment on that? Kelyn Brannon : No, I would agree with Jayshree. It is still a learning experience, and so we feel very comfortable with the guidance of 63% to 66% for Q1. Jayshree Ullal : Right. And long-term, we've always said that to gain market share and gain footprint, we would not be afraid with a 60% to 65% gross margin range. Erik Suppiger : So can we assume the enterprise growth is giving you some of that increased confidence in terms of the opportunity for the higher end of your guided range? Jayshree Ullal : I think that's one assumption, but you can -- let me add another assumption to that. You can make the assumption that some of our cloud titan purchases moved out of Q4 to Q1. Erik Suppiger : Okay. Secondly, are there any new software apps or tools that your customers are using in terms of some of the programmability in EOS? Is there any new dynamics in terms of customer adoption that's been fueling some of the adoption for Arista? Jayshree Ullal : That's an excellent question, Erik, and I'll try and give a short answer because we don't have all day. But the combination of more programmability is making people realize that more than meeting single-function controllers, what they really need is network management done right. So some of our partners like Splunk, VMware, ExtraHop, software companies that can work very -- Palo Alto Networks, that can work -- Ansible, Chef, Puppet, these are all examples of bringing DevOps and NetOps together and that is becoming more and more meaningful and more and more important. So certainly, Arista doesn't feel the need to be that management tool, but we very much are the underpinning to provide the manageability for that tool. Erik Suppiger : Is that adoption across any particular vertical? Jayshree Ullal : Not really. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan from Juda Group. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : I have 2 questions, first on the 4 verticals. You mentioned very well balanced growth in the quarter. When you think about 2015, I'm curious to see if you could potentially rank order growth and share gain opportunities in those verticals. And then also a follow-up question on the gross margin side. If you can just talk about what were the swing factors that drove this quarter to be higher. Jayshree, I think, you suggested maybe there are some cloud mix or business that got pushed out next quarter or so. Do you expect that to be a predictable swing factor on the lower side for next quarter for gross margin? Kelyn Brannon : So I'll just quickly take the gross margin question. Absolutely, if you think about the higher gross margin, it's to -- it was customer mix this particular quarter in Q4. Additionally, Q3 kind of -- we had some additional overhead costs that got absorbed, but didn't get replicated in Q4, which benefited the gross margin but, primarily, it's around customer mix. And as we look forward into Q1 with the guidance of 63% to 66%, as that play around our volume customers and how they come in [indiscernible] of the quarter, so we feel comfortable with that. Jayshree Ullal : And Suba, to answer your question on were there verticals that grew faster. Clearly, our largest vertical base is the cloud titan, so that doesn't tend to, in percentage, grew as fast, but all the other 3 verticals grew very nicely for us in Q4. Faster. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : And when you look at 2015, are there areas, particularly among those verticals, where you think the share gain opportunity's larger than others? Jayshree Ullal : I think one of the things you'll see us do is just put a deeper focus on all those 4 verticals, and we're not favoring one over the other, but they have so much similarity with each other. There are early adopters, they appreciate technology, they don't fall for B.S. marketing, so all of those make them the natural ones. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Unknown Analyst : This is Fahad [ph], in for Paul. Could you please comment a little bit on the Web 2.0 vertical? What were the trends? You mentioned that it was slightly weaker. Can you provide some color on it? Jayshree Ullal : I didn't mention it was weaker. It was very balanced, it was strong. But I did mention that our overall customer concentration of Microsoft for the year went down from 22% to 15%, which we view as -- Microsoft's an important partner, but we also view as a positive. Our cloud titans continue to be our most strategic partners. We are in 6 out of 7 of them. An example of Facebook and Microsoft endorsing our EOS+ announcement is a very clear example of that, so we're very bullish about that segment and we continue to be so for 2015. Unknown Analyst : And just one follow-up on more architectural questions that have come up recently. A lot of the competitors of yours are talking about integrating security down to the silicon level and really kind of addressing the total cost of ownership. Can you address how is that from a competitive perspective? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We see security as too much of a significant market for Arista to address by itself, so we will be working closely with partners there. Whether that's DDoS mitigation or encryption or firewalls, Palo Alto Networks comes to mind as one of our close partners as well as others, so we will do this in conjunction with key technology partners, not by ourselves. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : A couple of quick questions from me. First, just clarification on the guidance and the exclusion of the legal expenses, just wanted to understand if you're anticipating the legal expenses reaching that $5 million to $7 million per quarter in the first quarter already or if that's something you're taking into account further in the future? And then my second question was kind of, I guess, looking at your customer base and showing the good growth, how should we think about the diversification of customer base? What was your concentration in the fourth quarter? And how much diversification or increased diversification would you expect to see during 2015? Kelyn Brannon : So as far as looking at the legal expense, we decided that, starting off in Q1 of 2015 to be relatively transparent, go ahead and pull it out of the pro formas, but disclose what it is. As Marc took you through the ITC case and then what's going on in the Northern Court of California and the case is in the timeline of those, you can imagine that the expense is going to be loaded relatively throughout that period and it's just -- it really depends. So what I'm going to do is that on each quarter as we do the earnings call, I'll give you the range of what the legal expenses could be for the next quarter. Jayshree Ullal : And to answer your customer question, as I said, it was very balanced in Q4. Throughout 2015, we expect a good balance. So the low of any contribution of a vertical you can think of is 15% and the high as 25% to 30%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : A few questions for you. One, in terms of the margins, did the mix shift to 40-gig help your margins as well? And then how do you see Tomahawk helping your margins later on this year? Let's start with that. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. To answer that question, we saw both 40- and 100-gig adoption to really come in and complement our 10-gig, so I wouldn't call out 40-gig only as a sole contributor to our margins specifically. But it's clear that 10-gig, especially 10GBASE-T has -- resembled more like 1-gig whereas the high-performance sub-links like 10-gig, 40-gig or 100-gig generally are healthier. But I would generally tell you our margins are more affected by volume and customer mix than product mix. In terms of... Brian Modoff : And Tomahawk? Jayshree Ullal : In terms of chip vendors we work with, we obviously work very closely with them. We are in close trials. And no company knows better how to work with Merchant Silicon than we do. We work with 3 or 4 types of them. We look to add diversity there. We don't just take the silicon. So they're very excited about the -- our partnership with Broadcom and all the opportunities it represents. Brian Modoff : And then on the operating expense -- or excuse me, on the legal expense and putting -- taking it out of pro forma. So the logic of that is it's going to be a variable that's going to swing around every quarter depending on court activity? Kelyn Brannon : Exactly right, it could be. Brian Modoff : Okay. And last question, are you taking share versus Cisco on the Nexus 9K? Any feedback on that? And then one other one, if I can squeeze in was Microsoft, a 10% customer in Q4. Jayshree Ullal : So I -- we do not break out concentration by quarter, so I can't answer that. But are we taking share relative to the main competitor? We believe we are. We believe Cisco's market share in 10, 40 and 100, when the results come out it will show that they decreased and Arista increased. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Hendi Susanto : One question. If I look at your new Arista presentation, the data center switching market size estimates have been revised lower. Would you please share some insight on that lower revision? Jayshree Ullal : We don't control the forecast of products, but I'd say they're generally in the range. ASPs of products has stabilized, but obviously, selling prices have in the past years gone down as much as 10% or 15% a year. So I think the $7 billion got revised to $6.9 billion and the CAGR growth is still a very, very solid 14% to 15% a year, which is double-digit. So I wouldn't read too much into it. It's always hard to project the future years, so I think the difference between 2014 at $6.9 billion and $7 billion, which is the original forecast is within the round-off error. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal at Northland. Jeffrey Kvaal : I'm hoping that you can give us a few comments about 2015 in general, as I think last year, you did give us a few comments about the balance of the year, although, obviously later in the year. What can you tell us about how you feel the market is going to develop overall for revenue growth? Do you think that Microsoft is going to continue to -- I think, last year, you said it would be flat, and spending overall in decline as a percentage of sales. Should we take -- could you comment on either of those 2 items, please? Jayshree Ullal : I think it's a little too early for me to forecast any specific customer, but I would, in general, tell you, we -- because of our diversification, we are less reliant on any one customer as much as we were, say, back in 2013. Having said that, because we get such a substantial spend and Microsoft is such an important partner, we expect to get a large spend, but we still expect it to be flat to down this year. Not because we're doing anything wrong or they're doing anything wrong, but because they have spent so much with us. So that may change if Microsoft's strategy to spend more changes but, quite frankly, we don't get visibility to it beyond 1 to 2 quarters. Jeffrey Kvaal : Okay. And then secondly, there's been a lot in the press about what Facebook is up to with its Wedge and 6-pack switches. I think you have in the past, Jayshree, talked about how it's 1 application, et cetera, et cetera. Would you mind providing us a little color on how the relationship between you and Facebook is set to proceed through the course of the year? Jayshree Ullal : Yes -- no. Our relationship with Facebook is stronger than it's ever been. We are very aware of any internal developments. We view them as a customer, a partner, not a competitor. And I think it's a natural progression for them to develop since they have very smart engineers, their FBOSS and Wedge and OCP reference design. And they're very aware of the fact that, that design complements what Arista does. So nothing has changed there in my commentary. I just think you're seeing the examples and evidence of both what we do and what they do, and it really is a joint partnership. So we don't expect substantial change in the Facebook and Arista partnership in 2015. Jeffrey Kvaal : In what sense are they complementary? If you could spend a little more time on that, I would appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : I think I've said this before and then we can go longer at a later time which is because we have so many knobs on our EOS for programmability, control plane, management plane, data plane and scripting capabilities, we're able to work with them in a very customized fashion and we're not just dropping boxes. And we also have a lot of features that we've developed. Our EOS code has gone from 1 million lines to over 8 million lines so it's very different than an FBOSS, a singular application. So diversity and gender-purpose applications we support and the customization we do with Facebook is very different than Facebook's use case. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Georgios Kyriakopoulos from SunTrust. Georgios Kyriakopoulos : Jayshree, just to expand the discussion on Facebook. What is the risk that other cloud titans may decide to go the Facebook or Google route and develop their own solutions in the future? So when you spend time talking to them, what are their plans that you seem to get from them? Jayshree Ullal : Right. So it's really important to understand that Arista is a product built by engineers, for engineers. That's why we do so well with these engineering organizations in these cloud titans. But it's also important to understand that these engineering organizations are continuously developing and experimenting and building products of their own. They're not mutually exclusive. As I said, there's a capital market today that builds their own type of rack switches in a lot of these cloud titans. So we work with them. And where they have solutions, they use their solutions. Where they need a spine or additional type of lease or splines, they use our solutions. So I think it's important to understand, very important to understand that there isn't a uniform network design, which is just all 1 type, and a mix-and-match is very common depending on the use cases. Georgios Kyriakopoulos : Okay. And then on Cisco ACI, there has now been the full quarter since its availability. Although you discussed previously that customers are finishing the test evaluation, can you discuss if you experienced longer sales cycles as customers evaluate the Cisco solution and especially since your guidance for the March quarter is a bit softer? Jayshree Ullal : Actually, quite the opposite. We are experiencing shorter sales cycles because people finally understands the difference between the wafer ware and what ACI really is and, therefore, are embracing the universal cloud networking solution from Arista much more. And again, I can only speak to the 4 verticals. I'm sure that our areas of coverage where my competitors can speak much better to how it's doing. But in my customer domain, the confusion of ACI is far greater than the acceptance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Benjamin Reitzes : I wanted to ask 2 questions. Can you comment how sales in EMEA and APAC trended versus your expectations and sales investments? And I just have one follow-up. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Ben. As you can tell, we can do a whole lot better there and I feel like a bit of a broken record because I've said that for the last 3 quarters. I think the issue here is we're doing extremely well in all regions. So all boats are rising the tides. And because we're doing well in the United States, in some ways, it hides the fact that we're doing well in Asia and Europe as well. But we can do a lot better, I'd be the first to admit that. And our Mark Smith, our sales leader has hired an EMEA leader and we have hired leaders for Asia-Pac, Australia, Japan and Korea, all of who are new, so I'm hoping for improved and even better performance in the next 2 years. But I will caution you all to be patient there just like I'll have to be and realize it's not going to happen overnight. Benjamin Reitzes : Okay. Great. And just with regard to -- a simple question on pricing. Your gross margin was good, your guidance for gross margins seems quite confident, so in terms of the competitive issue with Cisco in pricing, how is that trending? And obviously, it seems like they're aggressive. Is it -- and you're weathering that fine. And is there any other color you can give around that? Jayshree Ullal : It hasn't changed. We're getting used to it. The weathering is fine. It hasn't changed. It's a way of life. And it's a very competitive industry, but it's driven not just by price, but performance and functionality and TCO. So we're holding our own. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Jayshree, can you talk -- give us an update on channel development? What's going on there? Will you guys be spending more dollars and time building that in 2015 versus 2014? Jayshree Ullal : Sanjiv, that's a good question. On one hand, logic would suggest we should. On the other hand, as you know, our 4 verticals are less channel-dependent. They look to buy from Arista and also [ph] through a [ph] channel. So the best answer I can give you at the moment is we will be extremely selective in our choice of channels, picking only elite partners who truly want to disrupt and change the landscape and not just be yet another enterprise provider. So you're not going to see us just sign up volume channels for distribution. And we are especially going to rely on channels internationally. We're also going to be looking at key technology partners, SIs and really the V in value-added resellers and channel is going to be important to us. So look for us to be more selective than sort of carpet bomb channel strategy. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Got it. So no change in terms of the amount of time or money that's going to be spent this year versus last year, it looks like. Jayshree Ullal : We will invest more, but no change in strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : My question is how diversified, let's say, by the end of last year, Jayshree, was your business with the other cloud customers outside of Microsoft? And where are we in the penetration of those customers? I'm talking about the other 5 that you have. I'm trying to figure how big that business really is. And is the opportunity really ahead of you? Or have you reached an acceptable run rate you already have with those customers? Jayshree Ullal : Kulbinder, you're fading a little in volume. I'm going to just rephrase the question. How does diversified were you with the cloud titans outside of Microsoft? I think we made big strides in 2014, but we have still a lot of scope and a lot of room in 2015 with our other cloud titans. I don't believe we are as penetrated in them as we are in Microsoft. Operator : The next question is from Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex Henderson : First question is on the tax rate. The tax rate guidance for -- that you gave last quarter, is that still accurate and, again, assuming no R&D credit? Kelyn Brannon : Right. So assuming a very similar kind of international to U.S. split, which is around that 80% to 20%, 20% internationally along with no R&D tax credit, that guidance of 30% to 32% holds. Alex Henderson : Can you talk a little bit about the ability of the company to hire attractive people? I know you guys are pretty picky about who you hire in both the R&D and in the marketing side of the ledger? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I'll speak to that. Kelyn, you may want to add to that. We continue to hold the bar very, very high. You're absolutely right. It's getting increasingly competitive to find damn good engineers here in the Silicon Valley. And many engineers in networking we wouldn't hire here. We are expanding our focus and facilities beyond Santa Clara, we already have Bangalore, India and Vancouver, Canada as identified sites to expand internationally and we'll be adding more. Alex Henderson : I guess the question really isn't are you adding them, obviously, you are. But when you grow your top line at 50% clip, I don't think you can find people at that rate. Are you finding it difficult to sustain your growth based on the number of people you're able to hire is the question. Jayshree Ullal : No. We're not. Because I think if we can't hire them here, we'll hire them elsewhere. We're not lowering the bar, but we're continuing to put emphasis on hiring. We're pleased with the rate of hiring we've done actually. Alex Henderson : Then last question then I'll cede the floor. You've talked a lot about the cloud titans. Can you give us any guidance or any thoughts at all on the rate of change in spending in that arena? Has there been any hiccups in terms of the last couple of quarters in the spending rate that might cause a change in either acceleration or deceleration as we go into 2015? Jayshree Ullal : So I'm not able to answer that Alex because I think our visibility is short-term, but we haven't seen any hiccups but we always see lumpiness. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu, in for Simon Leopold. I just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on the partnership with VMware and how the pipeline is developing based on that. Jayshree Ullal : Again, our partnership with VMware is one of my favorite and never been better. I think we have a common vision, common strategy. And the integration with both ESX and NSX as well as other touch points we have, is the best it's been. It's still early days. We announced this partnership in August, September last year. We have a number of customers together already on ESX, and we're now developing our customer base for NSX as well. Victor Chiu : Okay. Great. That's helpful. On the international front, I just wanted to ask if you guys were seeing any impacts from foreign exchange or any currency impacts, if that was a driver at all and are you expecting it might impact your results in 2015? Kelyn Brannon : Absolutely not. We -- as I think about our currency balance, although we -- and our subsidiaries, we have pretty much natural hedges in place. And so we only have the 1 quarter back in Q3 with the euro that had a little bit of an impact, but not really. But it's not -- I'm not seeing an impact from an OpEx perspective, and we're not seeing an impact as we think about our top line growth over there. So no, we're not exposed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert at Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : I also had 2 questions. First for Jayshree, another one on the channel and to what degree you're finding partners interested in working with you. Are you seeing competitors make it difficult for you to develop your channel? And how important of a growth driver could the channel be in 2015? Jayshree Ullal : I think the channel will be a very important growth driver for us, internationally. In the U.S., we are going to look for a different breed, those that are capable of selling innovative technology are focusing on new markets like Big Data, data analytics, the virtualization, the cloud, the software-defined networks. And so traditional channels, we will continue to use for fulfillment. But for value-add, I think our criteria is going to make it a more unique requirement. So are we having difficulty? No, because, I think, just like our hiring, we're putting a different bar on it, we have a different criteria. We'll be more selective and we're not going to measure our success by how many channels we sign. We're going to look for quality over quantity. Jess Lubert : That's helpful. And then for Kelyn, I had a modeling question. The operating outlook for Q1 was a little better than I would have expected given some of the SOX cost we talked about in the past and the need to invest for growth. I'd like to understand how we should be thinking about these items through the remainder of the year. And assuming we see sequential revenue growth beyond Q1, which I would expect, is there any reason we shouldn't also be modeling sequential operating margin improvement from Q1 levels? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Kelyn Brannon : As I think about it, we have in our annual operating plans all the -- we believe we captured all the costs that's going to take to get SOX-compliant, get the 404 opinion from our auditors, Ernst & Young. But as we kind of give the guidance out, there is a flurry of activity here and there, and then it slacks off as you are back into testing. And so I think what we would -- what I would ask you to do is wait for the guidance on the next quarter because there could be a little bit of lumpiness there, but everything is planned for. Jess Lubert : Is it fair to assume that you'd expect higher operating margins in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year as those tail off? Kelyn Brannon : Not necessarily. No. Jess Lubert : Any thoughts on what could potentially be the impact there if we do see the growth develop as we expect, what the incremental cost would be to offset that? Kelyn Brannon : Well, I mean, I would tell you that if you think about -- and it's certainly my area, G&A, we're relatively a fixed -- we're relatively fixed with headcount and what we're spending with kind of consultants and getting through SOX, and also investing in our ERP system. So if we do see significant growth on the top line, you'll see -- from a G&A perspective, of course, you will see leverage. Having said that, you'll also see us use the opportunity to continue to invest in R&D both in headcount, and as we think about development activities around new products and new silicon coming in and also in our sales and marketing organization. So if you think about on the bottom line, we feel comfortable for Q1 at that 22% to 25% and, of course, G&A later on if revenue grows, will get leveraged, right, and you would see, as a percent of revenue, improvement there. But we could use those investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra at Buckingham. Rohit Chopra : A couple of questions, Jayshree. Just given there was a slight shift in the cloud titans, I just want to get a sense on adoption of other platforms, so below the high-end, maybe the 7150, 7280, I know there were some trials of that, so adoption there. And then the other thing I want to ask, just back to legal. I know Marc gave his comments there, but are you guys having to make or are you thinking about making any changes as a contingency? And should we expect R&D to tick up for that as well? Jayshree Ullal : I'm going to answer the first question, I'll let Marc answer the second. In terms of acceptance of platforms, the flagship platform is really our EOS, and then everything else is form factor, right? The 7500E has been particularly well received because it's the only platform in the industry that's a spine platform that can do 10, 40, 100 with the right buffering. It's surprising to me that no one else does that. And so the combination of EOS and 7500E has been just very well received. The 7280 is a cousin of that platform. It's a miniature version, so that's being very well received as well. The 7150, particularly well-received for certain use cases like data analytics, monitoring and VXLAN virtualization. So we really have different folks and different strokes and different platforms and different use cases. But in general, the common thread through it all would be EOS and our spine platforms. Marc, you want to comment on the legal side? Marc Taxay : Sure. So I think the nature of litigations, we all know, really is that the claims, learning more about the claims and how they impact the products are going to be developed over time. That comes out through discovery and just through litigation process generally. We clearly have a number of different options that we're going to be considering as part of the defense, some of which may include potential design-arounds, of course, but those things are going to be developed over time. Jayshree Ullal : Too early to call what they would be. Operator : And the last question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum : A couple of things. First of all, Kelyn, just a couple of clarifications. Were there any legal costs in Q4, so we can comp it to your guidance going forward? And then OpEx, it seems to be flat going into Q1, flattish. Given the growth in international sales and marketing, just want to just get a sense as to how that TAM's in there. Then on some larger picture questions. Jayshree, are you even running into the 9K at all? Cisco says the 9K is now in 1,700 customers, but out of a platform of, what, 40,000, to 50,000 customers. So there could be large gaps in that customer base where you're not even running into the upgraded 9K. Just want to see how many times you actually go head-to-head with them. And then finally those 4 verticals that you... Jayshree Ullal : One second. Can we just hold on, there's 2 questions, so we can absorb and answer them because... Kelyn Brannon : So as far as legal, there was no legal expense pulled out of Q4 whatsoever. As you know, Cisco, sued us in early December and so no real meaningful legal expense related to Cisco. And OptumSoft litigation, that's consistently been put into the numbers throughout 2014 since that lawsuit occurred in April. And so now, there's nothing pulled out there. And then as far as the OpEx, flattish to slightly up Q4 to Q1, we feel good about the investments that we're making there and we're continuing to hire and we have our marketing programs in place and we have spending there for what we need for any type of prototypes with new products coming on, so we feel good about the number. Chuck Elliott : What was your second question? Ehud Gelblum : Okay. And then I had actually a follow-up. So that question was, are you even running into the Cisco 9K, given that the number they give seems to be a small number of customers overall? Jayshree Ullal : Look, I think Cisco needs to answer what percentage of their overall switching business the 9K is. I think that's small and, therefore, we don't run into it as often, but we do see it occasionally. And we're able to compete against it very effectively because we've been working with Merchant Silicon a lot longer than they have. Ehud Gelblum : Okay. Then let me ask you 2 quick follow-ups. One is you talked about your big 4 verticals, and you talked about the whole $7 billion data center market. What percent of that market can you hit by just staying in those verticals? What happens if you push too far into the channel? And then as a follow-up to that, when you do push out beyond those in the more mainstream enterprise, as you say you're looking to do, are those mainstream enterprise guys looking to use the same parts of EOS that your big 4 vertical guys are using? Or are there different aspects to that that attract them? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I'll answer your second question first. The pace of adoption is really defining the 4 verticals, right? And they tend to be the most sophisticated in features and capabilities and in demanding things from us. So the follow-on enterprises tend to use similar features or less of it. So in other words, if we can do these 4 really well, these are our toughest, most mission-critical use cases, so the other ones are natural subsets of that, if you will. We are seeing acceptance in a couple of enterprise verticals that seem to be promising, including education and research labs and media and entertainment. So I do believe we can branch out very easily from the high-tech enterprise into some of these others, but at the moment... Ehud Gelblum : And you're seeing that for the same reasons or for different reasons? Are they -- what are they attracted to in EOS, the same things as the big 4? Jayshree Ullal : Well, similar. Like I said, they're more about pace of adoption not -- the reasons are similar. They're just not at the same early pace of adoption as the first 4 verticals were. So that's consistent uniform cloud networking with programmable features, it's what makes us unique and differentiated from other proprietary lock-in systems. We see all the workloads, and all the workflows have to be handled in a similar fashion rather than customized for each enterprise and application like the mainstream workloads. So not only do the 4 verticals like it, but all the follow-on verticals love that, too. But it does take time to change an old habit. The enterprises have been around for 20 years, and I think that's what we're dealing it. That's when our next 4 verticals would come up when it's time for them to disrupt and change. Ehud Gelblum : Okay. And out of the big 4 verticals you're big in right now, what percentage of the market do they represent, gives us a sense? Jayshree Ullal : I don't know. We've not really broken it down, right? Kelyn Brannon : No. Jayshree Ullal : I don't have the exact... Ehud Gelblum : And how far can you run with those guys before you have get too far into the mainstream? Chuck Elliott : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. This concludes the Arista Q4 2014 Earnings Call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional perspective on our 2014 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. And this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Bechtolsheim, Arista's Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and recent Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.  Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation -- reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our Q1 2015 Earnings Call. I am pleased to report our fourth consecutive beat as a public company. Consistent with prior quarters, customer demand for our 7000 Series products drove our results that exceeded the consensus. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 71% of our sales. A significant and major contributor to the international increase came from the U.S. cloud customer expansion to both Europe and Asia. Without this, our organic international was 20% and the Americas was 80%. Revenue grew 52.8% year-over-year to a record $179 million. For the first time, service contributed more than 10% of the overall revenue as we are now breaking it into a separate category. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 66.1%, resulting in a doubling of our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.50 since Q1 2014, growing profitably in our competitive and dynamic industry.  We now have over 3,200 customers and continue our acquisition trend of 1 to 2 new customers per day. This quarter, our key highlights include, we announced our flagship Extensible OS as a disaggregated cloud-based-software-only purchasing model. EOS as a Subscription, called EaaS, offers customers balanced CapEx and OpEx flexibility. We expect the results of this model will be more measurable in the next 1 to 3 years. We formalized our converged infrastructure solution with Supermicro systems for high-performance 10- and 40-gigabit Ethernet computer networking. We forged technology alliances with Lawo at NAB 2015 for frame-accurate IP-based video routing and Infinera for metro-optical networking solutions. We believe that Arista is the first data center networking vendor to receive application marketplace certification from ServiceNow called Store. Customers can now have a more complete configuration archival, versioning and merging of DevOps and NetOps for cloud business platforms. In March of 2015, Crehan Research published their 2014 market share numbers for high-performance 10-, 40- and 100-gigabit Ethernet switching, minus blades. We believe this is a more holistic switching category than individual port speeds, which are less precise. Arista grew both in port share from 6.7% to 9.3% and in revenue share from 5.3% in 2013 to 7.7% in 2014. While quarterly trends may vary, we continue to expect that we will gain market share in 2014 -- 2015.  Finally, for the first time, leading analyst, Gartner, recognized Arista as a leader in the 2015 Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. It was based on a number of factors, including our high growth, our technology solutions and our flexible software. Given that there's been no leader in the data center sector since its inception, we are particularly honored by this validation.  Now I would like to turn it over to our Interim CFO, Andy Bechtolsheim, for Q1 2015 details. Andy? Andreas Bechtolsheim : Thanks, Jayshree. Before I discuss our financial results and guidance, I would like to note that except for revenue numbers that are GAAP, all financial numbers I will discuss are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.  Also we, starting this quarter, will break out service revenue, which has become more significant to us and will break this out separately along with the related costs.  Let me first comment on the 8-K that we filed earlier today, disclosing that we're going to amend our 10-K for 2014 due to a classification error in our 2014 statement of cash flows. The error was the result of a duplicate reporting of excess tax benefits associated with our equity incentive plans, resulting in a $17.4 million understatement of cash from operating activities and a $17.4 million overstatement of cash from financing activities. There was no change to the ending cash balance and there was no impact to our net income or the balance sheet. The error occurred due to inadequately designed controls surrounding our statement of cash flows, which resulted in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to remediate this control deficiency in the coming quarter by including additional review procedures to ensure the accuracy of the calculations and related disclosures in our cash flow statement.  Now let me turn to our Q1 results which reflect our continued market momentum as our customers embrace our innovative and best-of-breed software-defined cloud networking solutions.  From a top line perspective, total revenue for Q1 was $179 million, an increase of 52.8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We grew profits faster than revenue with net income of $35.5 million, up 117% from a year ago, and fully diluted EPS of $0.50 a share, up 100%. Our fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.34 a share, up from $0.20 a share a year ago.  Gross margin in Q1 was 66.1%, down from 67% in the prior quarter and 69.6% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance due to favorable product and customer mix during the quarter.  Our operating expenses were $67.1 million or 37.5% of revenue compared to $69.9 million or 40.3% of revenue in Q4 2014. The sequential decline in operating expenses, down 4% quarter-over-quarter, was primarily due to additional year-end bonuses that were accrued in Q4 '14. Operating expenses did increase 23% year-over-year, reflecting increased investments in headcounts.  Operating income for the first quarter was a record $51.3 million, increasing sequentially from $47.1 million in the prior quarter and an increase of 92% from $26.8 million in Q1 2014. Our non-GAAP results exclude expenses related to our litigation with OptumSoft and Cisco, which totaled $6.7 million for the quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet. We had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $484.3 million at the end of Q1, growing nearly $35 million from $449.5 million in the prior quarter. Accounts receivables was up $16.1 million from the prior quarter to $113.1 million, resulting in DSOs of 57. Inventory increased $10.7 million sequentially to $91.2 million in Q1, yielding turns of 2.5. The increase in accounts receivable and inventory resulted from increased volumes to support our revenue growth. Total deferred revenue was $132.8 million, an increase of $26.4 million over the prior quarter. This resulted from increased product deferrals and new service agreement renewals. Let me now move to our guidance for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance.  We expect total revenue between $183 million and $191 million, gross margin in the range of 63% to 65%, and we anticipate operating margin in the range of 23% to 25%. As we said previously, our gross margins will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, depending primarily on product and customer mix. The above guidance excludes expenses related to the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, which we anticipate will be in the range between $10 million and $12 million for Q2 '15. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 28% to 30%. As a reminder, Arista will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  With that, I will turn the call back to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Andy. And thanks for doing a fantastic job as our acting CFO this quarter. Andy and I are also pleased to report that we have completed our search for a Chief Financial Officer for Arista. Effective Monday, May 18, 2015, Eda Brennan [ph] will be Arista's new CFO. Eda [ph] brings over 2 decades of finance, executive and operating skills that align closely to Arista's culture, values and goals. We welcome her enthusiastically and wholeheartedly to our leadership team. So in conclusion, we are off to a good start this year. I am not only proud of our results, our customer traction and our growing market share, but very encouraged and excited by Arista's increased market opportunities ahead. Chuck Elliott : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Jess Lubert : Let's see if I can squeeze 2 in here. But I had a question first on the outlook. You're guiding below seasonal trends during the June quarter, so I was curious if you pulled some business forward into Q1 that was maybe impacting Q2 or if there was some other reason you're expecting less seasonality in what is typically a stronger period, especially for some of your cloud Titans? And then the second question, I was hoping you could provide some more details regarding which products are being made available on a subscription pricing basis, how broad of a customer set is interested in this method of consuming your offerings and the impact that the availability of subscription pricing is likely to have on growth going forward. Jayshree Ullal : All right, Jess. I'll take your first question. I think our guidance is cautiously optimistic and conservative. Not having a new CFO, we stayed with the current consensus estimates for the most part. The cloud Titans were a large contributor to Q1. Q1 is historically our weakest quarter seasonally. And then Q2, Q3 and Q4 are all strong quarters. So I wouldn't call our Q2 as the only strong quarter. Hopefully, all 3 will be. And so we feel comfortable with that guidance. I think we have an opportunity to meet it and maybe beat it. Jess Lubert : And then on the subscription pricing? Jayshree Ullal : So specifically, we introduced EaaS specifically on our high-volume platforms, the top-of-rack switches, the 7050 Series families, the main one, that comes in different form factors, 48-, 64-, 32-port, 40-gig, and the goal here really is to start offering our customers options. We've always said we're a software company, and we can now make software available on the Arista blue box, if you will, on a monthly subscription basis. Most people, most comfort buyers, like to see the 2 bundled, but I think, as I said, I think this will take time to absorb. But particularly with top-of-rack switches, it makes a lot of sense because the lifespan of those switches are 2 to 3 years rather than 5 to 7 years. Jess Lubert : Can you maybe just talk about the customer that's showing interest in this? Is this mostly cloud customers? And what are you hearing from... Jayshree Ullal : And you've now come to your third question, Jeff, so you will be off the charts now already. But no, typically, cloud customers tend to look at scale and volume. This would apply more to entry-level customers who are starting with small projects or smaller companies that don't have immediate large-cap expend and are looking for that CapEx, OpEx balance and flexibility in their budget. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to ask, I guess, a couple of related questions and hopefully we'll count those as one. First, we've started to hear about new products from competitors based on some of your suppliers, Merchant Silicon, anticipated for later this year. And I'm just wondering if you can talk about timing for that and your expectations for being able to maintain market advantage and I guess, time-to-market advantage. And then I guess kind of consistent with that, also wondering if and where we might be seeing an expansion of the use of Arista's switching products in applications that are not necessarily directly switching, but are more akin to routing, et cetera? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So as you know, our software has always been architected to support multiple software architectures. Today we support 3. And we are very nimble and very agile and usually being the first vendor to support new silicon architectures. So our leading vendors here had been Broadcom and Intel. We will be looking to add silicon diversity, both in new chips from these vendors, and we will be looking at other vendors as well. But we tend not to preannounce it. Usually, the silicon vendors will announce the silicon, and product from Arista can be anywhere from 9 to 12 months after that. Andy, do you want to add something to that? Andreas Bechtolsheim : Yes. I mean, we obviously don't preannounce future products, but I will say, we expect to be among the first who will ship new silicon once it's production-worthy and if it's -- once we get production parts. Jayshree Ullal : And we're particularly excited about not just the 40- and 100-gig options, but also the 25 and 50 that's emerging later this year. What was the second question? James Faucette : Sorry I was just asking about if you're seeing any cases where customers are using your products outside of traditional switching applications like, for example, in -- that you just typically assume routing. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So to us, switching includes routing. We have always been shipping options for both switching at Layer 2 and wire speed switching at Layer 3, a.k.a. routing. So when you look at our leaf and spine, now, products, many of them, a large level of them go out with routing features. And this has been true for us for the last 3 to 5 years. We will be looking to expand into routing adjacencies beyond that as well, so routing features vary depending on whether you're on the leaf or whether you're on the spine or whether you're on the core. Arista does not address the core routing market today. We largely interoperate with Juniper or Cisco or Alcatel in that case. But some of these core features, one could argue, are changing and particularly with the advent of large-scale ECMP and MLAG and VXLAN, where you can scale to 6 million nodes at L2 over L3, there's no reason a data center interconnect could not be a core routing or L2 over L3 fabric as well. So I think many routers, the noun, will turn into routing, the adjective, and Arista's already in the middle of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff of Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : Can we just talk a little more around the new products? And we got Tomahawk coming later this year. How do you see that impacting your business? And can you give us your opinion to what you think about its clients? And then how do you see the 25- and 50-gig port offering? Do you see that as additive? And then finally, just kind of back on your guidance, you're saying then you feel like your guidance right now is really just the fact that you have a new CFO and you're not about to put aggressive numbers out there for the new CFO to deal with? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So I think just to reiterate, we feel good about our guidance, we want to be able to meet it, and there's always room for improvement. But I'd remind you that we're still growing at double digits on a fairly large base of revenue. So don't knock that guidance too much. But going to back to your question on new products, Tomahawk, yes, very much an important silicon for 25- and 50-gig. I think much of this is the tail end of the year, really an impact on 2016. That's important to remember because it takes customers time to test, qualify. We don't look at products as just silicon and hardware. We also have a tremendous amount of software releases coming. We tend to go at the rate of 3 or 4 software releases a quarter. Andreas Bechtolsheim : A year, a year. Jayshree Ullal : Our last release -- sorry, a year. And our last release just had 120 new features across the leaf and spine and in many cases, core routing as well. So very comfortable that not only are we expanding our performance and scale, but also our feature velocity and programmability in many of these cases. So -- and yes, we will look to add silicon diversity, but we're not ready to talk about chips that are not available. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : I just have a question really around customer concentration and the verticals and geographies. Just Jayshree, can you just clarify? Did you say that Americas grew 80% and international grew 20%? Did I hear that right? I'd say that broke up in the call. Am I... Jayshree Ullal : No, no, no. I said the Americas contribution was 80% and international was 20%. And I was clarifying that that's the organic international. If you take the expansion of our cloud customers who deployed internationally, then it was 70%, 30%. Kulbinder Garcha : And then basically, in terms of customer concentration in the quarter, just how many 10% customers were they? And are all 4 verticals roughly still running at 25%? And is that something that you can hold as you go through this year, do you think? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So first of all, we don't break out customer concentration on a quarterly perspective and -- but I'll reiterate that the only customer concentration that we have announced and we still would talk about is Microsoft. So they remain the only one, if we were to have broken it out. The cloud Titans contributed very strongly this quarter. And so they were more than 25%. All 4 verticals did contribute. But in order of contribution, I would say, cloud first; service providers and Tier 2, second; high-tech enterprise, third; and financials, fourth. Kulbinder Garcha : And just one follow-up on that. And if that's the case, your gross margin still exceeded. And so is there something about the gross margin structure of the business that is presently continuously surprising because I would have thought the mix was that high towards cloud. It would have brought you more towards perhaps the lower end of your gross margin rate, but obviously, it hasn't. Jayshree Ullal : No. Look, I think we -- you should continue to expect to see our gross margins trend downwards, not only because of the cloud concentrations, but even as mainstream customers buy high volume, that they're going to get a cloud type of discount. So I wouldn't want to leave you with the message that our high-gross margins this quarter is a trend. I will continue to reiterate that our long-term view is 60% to 65%, and then our guidance for next quarter is 63% to 65%. So we're executing very well. We're managing our discounts with great discipline. But we continue to favor high discounts and low gross margin for large customers in general, including the cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Jayshree, I wanted to clarify first on the EOS as a service product. Of the customers you've attracted so far, have they been new customers to Arista who are deploying that? Or has it been existing customers who are choosing to use that payment structure? And then I also wanted to ask you about the strategic significance of your tie-up with Infinera. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So first of all, it's a very new introduction. We just introduced that in March. So it's still too early to call in terms of a lot of new customer wins. They've been mostly been in single digits. But of the ones I recall, all of them have been new. Simona Jankowski : Okay. And then on Infinera? Jayshree Ullal : I think Infinera is an example of an important strategic interoperability and solutions tie. It highlights, Simona, something you know very, very well and you've discussed, which is we can't be everywhere and we work closely with our technology partners to provide the best of capabilities in each one of us. So what we are really participating in Arista is in the data center and intra data center opportunity and obviously, a lot with third-party optics. But what we like about Infinera and particularly with their Cloud Xpress product line is we can now interoperate and offer solutions inter-data center across much longer-haul and distances. So there are obviously more operating at Layer 1, and we're doing still more at Layer 1, 2, 3 and 4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger of JMP. Erik Suppiger : On the litigation, you were about $7 million in the quarter, and that's going to $10 million to $12 million. Do you think that $10 million to $12 million is a reasonable base to go forward in terms of the litigation cost on a quarterly basis? Jayshree Ullal : It's hard to predict litigation. I will tell you this is a complex case and expensive. I'm going to ask Marc Taxay if he can answer that question. We feel good about $10 million to $12 million for Q2, but now we are at the peak of our activity, aren't we? Marc Taxay : I think that's right. I think Q3 actually -- Q3 of this year actually is probably going to be a little higher. The expectation will be just because the hearings in the ITC will be occurring then. But otherwise, I think, what we've got there is pretty consistent. Jayshree Ullal : That sounds like a norm, but there will be some peaks. Okay? Erik Suppiger : Okay. And then one other quick one. Cisco was talking yesterday about some good growth in their IPFIX customer adoption. What are you seeing on the SDN front? How is that market evolving from your perspective? Jayshree Ullal : I have to be honest here. It almost feels like we're in 2 different planets. I haven't seen any of the IPFIX customers, so they must be very, very much Cisco-specific applications. The 9K, which is also considered to be a strong contributor, my guess is it's 3% of their total switching revenues. So again, it's pretty insignificant. And our real focus is on building open programmable systems where customers are going from yesterday's enterprise applications to tomorrow's modern cloud killer application. So I think we have to make a distinction between IPFIX being bundled to customers and what's really in production. According to leading analysts, there's very few in production. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan of Juda Group. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : My question was on adjacencies. Jayshree, you talked about this briefly, but when you think about WAN opportunities, be it a more routing-like functionality, maybe optical integration into packet platforms, can you talk about where you are in kind of the process of providing that functionality and when that can start to become meaningful from a revenue perspective? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Subu. First of all, I want to highlight that one of the beauties of adjacencies is we want to be able to develop the ones that our software and our Merchant Silicon is naturally adhering to rather than go off and create a new one. So as we look at adjacencies, they have to be part and parcel of our engineering strength and our go-to market strength. That's a key tenet for us, that we're not going into a completely different market or segment or a decision-maker or buyer. So when you look at the kinds of adjacencies that we've already done, I want to talk about the ones we've already done, there's 2 that come to mind. One is we're already supplying through merchant optics a variety of short-range, long-range, single-mode, multimode, universal optics that provide a huge range of interconnect options for our leaf and spine solutions. And as you know, we were the pioneer of leaf and spine and cloud networking back in 2010. A second example of where they're already in adjacencies will be data analytics. A set of features we introduced over a year ago called DANZ data analysis is now really a nice option where customers don't have to buy a dedicated switch and a dedicated appliance for their data collection and monitoring and analysis. And this is a big deal for big data and structured and unstructured data. And it ends up being just a software option rather than dedicated hardware. And then there's what's you bring up. I think the advent and embracing of large multi-cast and route scale to [indiscernible] is going to be a natural feeder at the signs for us to do more routing. And there's 2 aspects to that. One is [indiscernible] is starting to have larger and larger routes. You're going from 60,000 routes to potentially 100,000 routes, to even 1 million. And the second is our software is getting more and more capable in this area. And this is why EOS has moved from -- what was it, Andy, when you founded the company? 1 million lines of code to over 8 million? And this is what routing and scaling protocols and programmability and working with all of our partners is doing for us. So I hope I answered some aspects of your question, but there's a natural adjacency there and I'm excited about the increase in TAM that could do for us in the next few years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Thompson of Wedbush Securities. Scott Thompson : A question around the Savvis deal. It sounded as if that was strong this quarter. Should we expect that to continue? Could this be a trend where service providers come on strong for a few quarters? Or is it maybe just a sign that things are getting a little more competitive and you guys are mixing it up there? Can you comment a little bit on service provider and Savvis in particular? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I could definitely comment on service provider, but I didn't mention any one by name, Scott, so... Scott Thompson : Okay. Go ahead and comment on service provider. I guess I heard something that was mispronounced or something. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Maybe my accent. Service providers generally come in 2 or 3 flavors for us. There's the Tier 1 service providers. And as you can imagine, they're the most difficult to engage with and penetrate. And you can imagine, we've been working with them in large trials. And we tend to work with them on a project basis. And this represents a tremendous opportunity for us. But today, it's very early days for us. Then there's Tier 2 service providers and Internet-hosting providers and content providers. And this is where Arista has actually shined. We've done very, very well because all of the media streaming and content generation resembles in many ways and then the metro junction resembles in many ways distributed aspects of the cloud typing market. So everything from the scale, the features and the demand they put on us are somewhat similar to that. So I would say our success to date has been in those 3 segments, the Internet-hosting providers, the Tier 2 cable providers and the content providers. And I would say we've got a lot of room and scope there, and we've got a lot of room internationally, and we've got a lot of room in Tier 1 service providers. One of our areas of great focus, in addition to financials, is really a go-to-market and ahead of service providers, particularly in North America right now. So stay tuned and maybe we'll be able to share more wins, but we feel quite good about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : Maybe the economics and the rationale of as you push more into market adjacencies is the goal to expand your wallet share with existing customers. Are they asking you to move into these areas? Or is it more a broader vertical expansion from your part? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should track your early success as you spread your wings further. Jayshree Ullal : Right. I think -- thanks, Mark. I think, first, it's important to reiterate that we've got a long ways to go in our primary market, which is the data center, which is at $10 billion going to $15 billion and within our 4 verticals. Our share, as I shared with you in 2014, is in the 7% to 9%. So we're looking to grow that into the double digits and more double digits and more double digits. No triple digits, for sure. So that's important, and that's where our primary focus is. In terms of adjacencies, the point I'm really making is the adjacencies are coming to us, both in terms of technology and as you rightly point out, in terms of customer demand. They are saying, hey, if we're using an Arista's spine, why can't we make the spine do other things, whether it's a data center interconnect or DANZ features or more optics or more routing. So we're just -- the spine -- and Arista is the only product who has a real spine. Anybody who says they're a spine is not. Many of them are spineless products. And so these have, in my view, the most capacity scale and capability and software advantages to offer our existing 4 verticals the best adjacencies. Mark Sue : That's helpful. And Jayshree, maybe just the Cisco lawsuit, is it having any impact on your rate of bookings? Any color there would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, yes. That's a good question. We said this in the last quarter, now reiterate again. I want to be really clear on that. The impact of the lawsuit with our customers has not been there. We do have to explain it. There's no doubt that we're spending a lot of time and money on the lawsuit litigation process itself, but our customers have been very savvy and understanding. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum : So a couple of things. First of all, just a clarification. When you said, Jayshree, in an earlier question that you don't see IPFIX, I thought IPFIX for the most part it was proprietary and running on Nexus. And so anyone is going to actually consider IPFIX. By definition, it almost has a sort of a pure Cisco deployment to begin with, like they made that -- made the decision already. So I just want to confirm or clarify that it will be odd for you to actually see an IPFIX consideration because you wouldn't have invited that switch party, anyway. I just want to confirm if that's true. And that will lead to my other question about overlay controllers. How often -- obviously, you're partnered with NSX. You're partnered with Nuage. How often are you seeing deployments, if you got the overlay controllers, versus how often are you seeing bare switch deployments? And is that ratio kind of changing or kind of trending over time? And then I have a follow-up. Jayshree Ullal : Yes -- no, they're both good question, really. On the IPFIX, yes, that's exactly right. Maybe we are on 2 different virtual machines and planets. If IPFIX is being installed with catalysts and existing Nexus, there's a good reason we don't see it. But we do see the Nexus 9K, so that's why I'm a little surprised we see that, but we don't see the IPFIX. So I think it really goes down to there's a set of customers, especially our 4 verticals, that really demand open standard innovation. And I'm not really looking for vendor lock-in. And like you pointed out, there's probably a set of customers they're not in, which is more the traditional enterprise that is designed to be end-to-end Cisco, if you will. And so to answer your second question on overlay controllers, as you know, for the 2 years that we've all talked about SDN, Arista's been adamant that we're having to focus on building a programmable underlay software stack. It's taken us the better part of 10 years to do that. It's programmable at, at least 6 levels, kernel, data plane, management plane, control plane, application plane and customer scripting plane and virtualization plane. But our goal has always been BYOC, bring your own controller. And one of our favorite partners is VMware, both with the vSphere vCenter and NSX. We see a lot of customer activity together. It's been early days. It's really been only -- we announced this relationship on -- specifically on NSX last August, so it's been about 6 months. And we are very pleased with the momentum and progress there. We do work with other controllers, and we also connect natively very many times into OpenFlow or OpenStack. So we don't preclude any of those options because we have all the right northbound and southbound APIs. We also have many savvy customers who want to play with our SDK and customize it too. So all of the above options are very, very valid, but it all starts by, \"You can't do much with an overlay controller if you don't have a good software underlay.\" Ehud Gelblum : Right. And finally, your inventory was up $10 million sequentially. Last quarter, it was up $20 million sequentially and you made the comment that it was up so much because \"supporting revenue growth.\" The fact it was only up $10 million versus last quarter's $20 million, how should we read into that? And does it look like perhaps there was -- was some of the strength this quarter due to builds and -- that happened late last quarter, that you got inventory in place for but couldn't quite deliver by the end of the quarter? And so did that help boost this quarter? And are we kind of back to some sort of a normal trend? Is that the best way to read into... Jayshree Ullal : Thanks for helping answer the question and the answers for these. I'm going to ask my CFO to take that one. Andy? Andreas Bechtolsheim : Yes. Obviously, we had an increase in deferred revenue. It's a significant increase in deferred revenue this quarter, which goes hand-in-hand with an increase in inventory. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold of -- from Raymond James. Simon Leopold : A quick clarification that I -- hopefully is easy and then a broader question. I think Jayshree, you talked about a split between domestic and international of 80%, 20%. In the past, you've given us, I think, the split, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pac. I'm wondering if we could get sort of a like-for-like comparison on the regionals. And what I was hoping to ask you about was earlier, you talked about the 4 key verticals and I wanted to really understand the mirror image of that in terms of understanding the progress. How much business have you done outside of the historic 4 key verticals? What's been the progress? What measurements can we take in terms of understanding the movement into the other markets that you've talked about in the past? Jayshree Ullal : Right. Okay. I'm going to take your last question first because otherwise, I have trouble remembering. So if you don't mind. And so our 4 verticals, Simon, really account for more than 90%. That's why they're our top 4 verticals in a huge way. Because even when we do some enterprises, generally, they tend to be high-tech enterprise and we put them into high-tech enterprise buckets. So at this point, I would look at us as very much driven by these main 4 verticals. And there's not a lot we're expanding yet or going into beyond these 4 verticals at the moment. And there's so much to do in these 4 verticals. It's something I'd reiterate. Just to clarify the geography, I hope I didn't confuse you, all. Actual Q1 2015 numbers is Americas at 71% -- or 70% and EMEA and Asia Pac at 30%. And what I tried to say in that 30% is that a contribution to that EMEA and Asia Pac of 30% came from the U.S. cloud Titans deploying there. So if I took those out, it would be 80%, 20%. And beyond that, we really don't break out the EMEA and Asia Pac separately. So it's 70%, 30% or 80%, 20% depending on how you count organic and inorganic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Fahad Najam : This is Fahad in for Paul. If you could provide the total customer count for this quarter? Jayshree Ullal : I think we said it, over 3,200. Fahad Najam : Over 3,200, sorry. And lastly, on the competitive front, can you comment about the increasing threat from top-of-the-rack vendors entering into the leaf part of your business? Do you see an increasing competitive platform in white boxes? Jayshree Ullal : No change for us. I know we've discussed white boxes quite a bit. The heart of a white box is the software. And anybody can build a box, but nobody can build a software. And I think there's really 3 types of software stacks : the classic, what I call Blob-OS; and the Cloud OS, which is what we're building; and then the build-your-own-stack, which you can do with many operating systems. But a majority of the customers don't build their own PC or server, let alone their network, which is so mission-critical. So a lot of discussion, but no change in competitive dynamics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani : Two questions. One -- the easy one is on service margins. We only have 2 data points, we have last year and this year, on the quarter and it went down from 73% to 80 -- to 64% roughly. Can you discuss the service gross margin dynamics? I don't have anything in between, so I don't know if it went up and down and kind of what are the trends there. Second, it's more kind of a broader question. I read an interesting article this morning about Cisco actually having a white box strategy, taking the 3K, stripping out the software and letting Amazon put in their own software on top of it. Whether it's right or wrong, I have no idea, but the hardware is basically the same. Generically, it's the same hardware based on same ASIC that everyone else is using. So the question I have is how difficult is it for your key customer, your large customer, Microsoft, how easy or how difficult is it for them to switch out the vendor, to replace you with someone else? Are they -- can you speak about not the hardware part, but rather the software part? Can you speak about how you're entrenched into their network, into their system? Is it your software or their software, et cetera, et cetera? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So your first question was on service margins and why have they come down year-over-year. As you know, our revenues increased significantly year-over-year. It's an area we're making significant investment, both in people and in Software-as-a-Service investment. So I think 73% was too high and 64% is more real. So that's the first question. In terms of the strategy on leaf and spine and how sticky we are with customers. The spine tends to be a 3- to 5-year decision. It's extremely sticky, both in hardware and software. It's not the kind of thing they easily move from one to the other. And clearly, that's where a lot of our strength comes from. Leaf, in general, tends to be a more disposable unit. Usually, those switches and the silicon churn is every, what do you say, Andy, 18 months, 2 years? Andreas Bechtolsheim : 18 months. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So the product cycle is at least 2 to 3 years. So in every cloud provider, in general, the lifespan of a leaf product is 2 to 3 years. The lifespan of a spine product can be 5 to 7 years. And so our stickiness is shorter in a leaf than in a spine. Tal Liani : Got it. And Jayshree, just one follow-up. Your position, you're entrenched into the 25-gig and 50-gig cycles for next year, you're one of the leaders in the space. I remember that from the beginning early on. The question is where can you innovate there? Meaning, if -- is it just about your operating system and is it -- and I'm asking the question in a dumb way, but is it that important or can it be replicated with other operating systems the same kind of value you bring in? Jayshree Ullal : You actually ask the most insightful questions that I didn't answer in the previous time you asked it, which is anybody can churn chips and build boxes in Asia or here and they can be white or bright or blue. But Arista's -- and our competitors' value-add is really the software and the -- building high-quality rich protocol, stable, single-image software that solves your OpEx and CapEx problems is a nontrivial effort. It's taken us several hundreds of engineers. It's taken us 2004 to 2015, so over 10 years. And there's a real case, and many customers do ask us, would we port our EOS to other platforms? And as I've often said and I've said very openly, to me, that's not a white box, that's a software strategy that we don't preclude. And that's the real differentiator, whether it's on 25-, 40-, 50- or 100-gig. Executing on the hardware, you have to do every year. Executing on the software is a multi-year, multi-decade effort. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Sorry, there's noise in the background, I'm at the airport. But 2 questions, Jayshree. On the international-domestic mix, understanding that they go 70%, 30% because the [indiscernible] is building outside of the U.S. Is that something that we should continue to see? I mean, are we going to see more 70%, 30% mix versus sort of the 80%, 20% you've had in the most recent quarters? And then second question, you kind of the partially answered it with Tal, but understanding that your software is a differentiation. However, there was one other key element with white box that is the support. And are you starting to see more white box in RFPs or more penetration of bright box? And again, I understand the software aspect, but the support aspect seems to be addressed by the bright boxes? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So the 80%, 20% has been pretty steady for the last 4 quarters on our domestic and international mix. We would like to see it improve, and that's why we're making significant investments on international and I'd certainly like to see it go from 80%, 20% to 75% to 85% for starters and then 70%, 30%. The international mix we had this quarter was really due to the fact that many of our cloud providers, who we've been selling to for a long time, first started their deployments in the U.S. and now in their second and third year are adding international expansion. And so that, I believe, contributed this quarter and can contribute to subsequent quarters because more and more of their success in the U.S. will require them to think of how they will do this outside the U.S., since many of them are worldwide organizations. And that's why from a measuring point of view, I want to make sure that Arista measures both the organic and the inorganic international success. So I view this as more cloud success than international success, to be very clear. Sanjiv Wadhwani : And on the bright box, Jayshree? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, on the bright box, honestly, I have to tell you, Sanjiv, the discussion on it is far greater in the news and press and print than it is with our customers. Our customers are really not looking to be switch developers. They want a high-quality switch where they can reduce their CapEx and OpEx. And to the extent our software and our technology can tune both of those, there's not that many questions on how do they build a white box, there's very many more questions on how can they make SDN and cloud technologies work for them to reduce their OpEx. Chuck Elliott : This concludes the Arista Q1 2015 earnings call -- actually, hold on. We've got one more question, who just popped in. Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex Henderson : Jay, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the rate of new feature additions on your software platform look like versus what you see from Cisco versus what you see from the white box competitors? What's the rate of velocity that you're seeing in your feature adds? Jayshree Ullal : Very high. I think that's the beauty of our software architecture, right, everything from the published subscribed model to the high availability. We're able to check in code. We're able to test code. We're able to do automation and diagnostics. And we're able to define a feature, implement a feature and get a feature to a customer in 3 to 6 months that could otherwise take 2 to 3 years in classic traditional software releases. So we see that as a 2-part advantage. One is in our approach to how we write code, but the other is the underlying architecture. It's so programmable that we can compile and test and put it out very, very quickly and with very, very high quality and with very, very little effect on the other software agents because they're still isolated from a software containment and software [indiscernible] point of view. So this is really our hallmark. And this is why when you see the rate at which we've had features, it's faster by 3x to 5x more than other vendors and participants there. And this is because the company -- look, 2004 to basically 2008, 4 or 5 years, just building the software architecture. So it's the hallmark of the company and one we are proud of. Alex Henderson : Could you tell me, do you see, as you track the actual number of feature sets that are added, that... Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so like I said, like I said, we did 120 features in our last release. If I were to compare those to traditional companies, it would be 1/2 that or 1/4 of that or sometimes even 1/10 that. Alex Henderson : How about versus Cumulus? Jayshree Ullal : It's difficult to answer that question to a specific vendor, so I won't try. Alex Henderson : Okay. And then second question, do you think you have a time-to-market advantage as a result of the hypervisor on your switch when the next-generation 25-gig chip comes out from Broadcom? Jayshree Ullal : So again, one of the things -- and I'm actually going to go back to your question on how about white box features. I was able to get an answer. Thank you, Marc. Generally, white boxes add x features, legacy adds 2x and Arista adds 5x. That's a good range of contrast. So -- and going back to your question now. Andreas Bechtolsheim : Time-to-market on the Tomahawk. Jayshree Ullal : Time-to-market... Andreas Bechtolsheim : Let me actually answer that. So the key -- one of the key attributes we have in the company is the single-image EOS across all of our platforms, which really include, of course, the next-generation chipsets as well, which means that customers who receive the next-generation chip technology will be able to run exactly the same familiar and fully proven EOS release that they're running today. So we don't expect any hiccup or any other delays in rolling out the next silicon because, again, the software is exactly the same as we're shipping today. Chuck Elliott : Okay. This time, this does conclude the Arista Q1 2015 Earnings Call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation which provides additional perspective on our Q1 2015 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2015 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our Q2 2015 earnings call. I'm pleased to report our fifth consecutive beat as a public company. Consistent with prior quarters, customer demand for our 7000 Series EOS-based platform drove results that exceeded the consensus. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 77% of our sales and 23% was generated internationally from EMEA and Asia Pacific. We are witnessing continued traction with financials and modern enterprises and significant contribution from many of our cloud titans and service providers. Revenue grew 42% year-over-year to a record $195.6 million. Service contributed more than 10% of overall revenue. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 65.8%, resulting in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54, growing 50% year-over-year in our competitive and dynamic industry. We now have over 3,390 customers and continue the acquisition trend of 1 to 2 new customers per day. This quarter, we had many key highlights. We announced a transformational network-wide state-based management platform called CloudVision. CloudVision is a very meaningful entry into software-based subscription services offering a network-wide operational control. It dramatically improves network change control for many of our customers. CloudVision offers a unique array of capabilities differentiated by a single point of workload integration, network-wide rollback and workflow automation and visibility. We do expect the results of CloudVision to be a multiyear journey and much more measurable in 2016 and 2017. CloudVision has been endorsed by many of our new and existing partners, including VMware, NSX, Microsoft, Hyper-V and Windows Server, HP, Dell, F5, Infinera, Palo Alto Networks, Nuage, Rackspace and Supermicro. Speaking of partnership, we formalized our converged infrastructure solution with HP for Cloud-Class Networking with HP's compute and OneView integration. We believe this is an important step not only for us, but the industry in moving towards converged solution for mainstream enterprises. We have now surpassed 5 million cloud networking ports in cumulative overall shipments. Our first million ports, to put this in perspective, took about 4 years. Our fifth million port was achieved in approximately 1/10 that time. We are therefore forecasting a cumulative revenue that will exceed in excess of $2 billion by the end of this year as we continue to feel good about gaining market share and customer relevance in our 10, 40 and 100 gigabit Ethernet data center market.  Now I would like to turn the call over to our new CFO, Ita Brennan, for further financial details. Welcome, Ita, to your first earnings call with Arista Networks. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to announce the results for the second quarter of 2015, my first quarter with Arista. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 '15 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation expenses and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuit. A reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q2 were $195.6 million, up 42% year-over-year and comfortably above our guidance range of $183 million to $191 million. We experienced good momentum across all key verticals in the quarter, and we're pleased to see our service revenue continued as a model percentage of revenue.  International revenues totaled $45 million or 25% of total revenue. While we are focused on expanding our international footprint, you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployment. Although not impacting our financials at this point, CloudVision has demonstrated some good early market acceptance in the short time since our product launch, and we expect to see good traction into 2016 and beyond.  Overall gross margin in Q2 was 65.8%, down slightly from Q1 at 66.1% and just above the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter. As a reminder, the biggest driver of volatility in our gross margin number is customer mix and to a lesser degree, product mix with large customers earning higher discount level. While our 4 verticals were well represented in our revenues for the quarter, we also experienced good traction with several of our cloud titan customers.  Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $74.7 million or 38% of revenue, up 33% from the prior year and 11% from the prior quarter. Our spending increases were largely focused on additional personnel in sales and marketing and R&D, higher prototype expenses and additional consulting costs as we complete our first year of SOX compliance. Our operating income for the quarter was $54 million or 27.6% of revenue.  Other expense for the quarter was $0.4 million, and our effective tax rate was 27.6%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $38.8 million or 19.8%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was $71.2 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share number of $0.54, up from $0.50 from the prior quarter and up over 50% from the prior year.  Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $9.9 million for the quarter, in line with our outlook on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above.  Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $552 million. We generated $52.6 million of cash from operations in the June quarter, up from $20.8 million in the prior period. DSOs came in at 57 days, flat to last quarter. Inventory turns were 2.7x, down from 2.8x in Q1. At the end of Q2, we held approximately $100 million in inventory, including $28 million of raw materials. Our inventory planning strategy is to leverage inventory [indiscernible] where needed to ensure that we can flexibly respond to our customers' needs. That said, this will be an area of increased focus in coming quarters as we look to improve our inventory metrics.  Our deferred revenue balance was $164 million, up from $133 million in Q1. This balance is largely made of short and long-term service contracts with some product deferrals related to acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days was 59 days, up from 43 days in Q1. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 million. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. We are pleased with our financial performance in the first half of 2015 with revenues up 47%, and earnings per share up 75% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to increase our market share and gain traction across key verticals and customers. The market remains competitive from a pricing perspective, and as mentioned above, our gross margins will fluctuate depending on our customer mix. We will continue to invest in the growth of the business, both in terms of increased headcount and the build-out of infrastructure as we expand our worldwide presence. We will do this in a judicious and powerful manner and within the parameters of our business model, which calls for operating expenses of approximately 40% of revenue.  With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows : revenues of approximately $208 million to $212 million, gross margin of approximately 53% to 65% and operating income of approximately 25%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 28% to 30%, with diluted shares of approximately 71.7 million. Please note that based on our current understanding, we expect that the cost associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $15 million for this quarter, with this quarter representing a peak expenditure quarter as we engage directly in trial activities. I'll now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We're now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. We're expecting a lot of great questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, all. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : Jayshree, if you can talk a little bit about customer mix and product mix. You mentioned all 4 verticals were strong. Were there any particular standouts between the segments and between -- similarly between modular and fixed form factors? And then the other question I had was on carrier. Can you talk about carrier opportunities? How they're playing out this year with Tier 1 telcos and what the applications there may be? Jayshree Ullal : Right. Thanks, Subu. First of all, on the vertical mix, we were very pleased with the balance of all 4. The cloud titans were the top performer, followed closely by the service providers and Tier 2, Tier 2 cloud hosting providers. But I would say, the financials and high-tech enterprise are holding and growing very nicely as well, so all 4 verticals performed in a balanced fashion. Our top 10 customers included customers from all 4 verticals. Specifically, in terms of carrier, as you well understand, carrier cycles are extremely long. It's a process we expect to be multiyear. We're getting early acceptance in the Tier 2 carriers. We're starting to make small inroads in the Tier 1 carriers as well, but nothing we would comment on or describe immediately since they're multiyear journeys. In general, I would say, the mix between modular and fixed remains similar. We've always said that leaf or fixed is, in terms of product mix, about half and then the modular and the optics and associated accessories is the other half. And we continue to see like the most well-accepted sign in the industry and the reception has been very good and continues to be good. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : And if I can briefly follow, Jayshree, on the carrier side. The initial traction, is that for applications within the data center? Or are you starting to see inter-data center applications as well? Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question, Subu. As you know, our focus, our market share, our relevance is all in the data center. The carriers have a lot more expenditure outside the data center, but Arista's focus today, right now, is in the data center. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Jeffrey Kvaal : There has been some concern in the marketplace about the pace of data center spending heading into the second half of the year. I'm wondering if you could share with us what you are seeing from your customers about the pace of their purchasing behaviors in aggregate. And any reasons why you think there might be a slowdown either in the second half of next year -- or this year or heading into next year? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jeff. As far as we can tell, our TAM is still extremely big and we're less affected by macroeconomic situations and paces. Specific to the data center, in the 4 verticals I referred to, we're seeing good pace in all 4 of them. I would highlight that cloud titan as particularly high pace for 2015 in general for the first half, and we continue to remain positive about the second half as well. Jeffrey Kvaal : Okay. So your visibility, Jayshree, then is as good as it's been, if not better? Jayshree Ullal : Jeff, I've always said our visibility is short term with -- especially the cloud provider, so we never know beyond a quarter or 2. So I can't say about next year, but I feel good about this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz : Jayshree, can you just remind us about how you think about longer-term gross margin targets relative to the cloud titan mix as that grows as a percentage of overall revenue? You guys have continued to execute pretty well in the margin line here, and the cloud titan there is obviously the #1 vertical. So is there a magic mix level where they get the 40% to 50% of revenue and you would really expect to see the margins get impacted by that? Or maybe the pricing isn't so bad with that group of customers? Jayshree Ullal : Right. So Alex, first of all, welcome to your first call. I think you -- this is your first one since you started covering us, right? Alex Kurtz : Yes, glad to be here. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, good to have you here. What we've said in the past when maybe you didn't cover us is there is a big difference between the gross margin from our cloud titans and the rest of the customers, and the driver is really volume. Our cloud titans drive significant volume and pricing to our customers, and therefore, gross margin is very much driven by volume. So there is a delta of at least double-digit points between our -- the gross margin we tell you guys about and share with you and what they can be with the cloud titan. So obviously, lower in case you thought they were higher, by the way. So that continues. Having said that, we've also -- coupled with that, we also believe that we are going for footprint and market share, and there are a number of transitions going on. There's a number of competitive things goings on. The transitions going on is 1 to 10 gig in the leaf and then also 10 to 40 and 100 gig in the spine. We also see many transition that will come up next year for 25 and 50 gig. So speed transition means you have to drive the speed at higher speed at lower price, and that can have an impact on gross margins because you're trying to provide better price performance, so that's always the case. And then as we go for a race to footprint, we would look to gain market share and not always pay perfect attention to our market share. So while our gross margins -- all this as a backdrop to say that while our gross margins today have -- are in the 65%, they have come down from last year, 67%, and we project our long-term gross margins to be more consistent with the industry gross margins of 60% to 65%. Obviously, in that process, we hope we'd also gain share and grow to be $1 billion and multibillion dollar company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Hendi Susanto : Jayshree, I have questions. Interested in hearing more about the transitions toward 25 and 50 gigabytes. So in terms of timing and then multiple round of transitions, like, what is your expectation and outlook for the transition? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Hendi, that's a good question. First of all, I think this is -- the 25 and 50 gigabit transition will take time. The spec only got finalized this year, and the chips are only coming into the marketplace really effectively 2016. So the company, Arista, has been through 7 product transitions in literally 7 years. So we're very comfortable that the 25 gig and 50 gig is another speed transition, but very similar to a lot of our leaf product transitions we've done already in the 10 gig space or in the 40 gig space. So we don't see this as a dramatic event, but a natural, if you will, progression event of price, performance and speed. Where we think this will -- 25 and 50 will have more impact is especially for storage application. I think general-purpose compute can and will remain at 1 and 10 in many cases, and then the high-performance storage may have a great desire for 25 and 50. In terms of the spine, we think the major spine components will be 40 and 100. So there's room for every application, if you will, and every feed, and that's why we're doing so many of them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Just quick follow-up on the margin question. You've made it clear, Jayshree, that we -- that you intend the and expect that the gross margin will come down to be more like industry averages. On the other hand, you've historically looked at being close or below the 25% operating margin level, but this quarter, you're guiding for that level. Do you think the 25% is kind of the -- should be the new long-term benchmark? Or is there something anomalous in this quarter that you're a little more confident on that? And then I wanted to ask from a business development standpoint, if the HP partnership and go-to-market work that you're doing there has started to have an impact. And how you're thinking about that and its opportunity to increase your addressable market going forward? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James. I'll take the second question first, and then, Ita, if you don't mind, I'm going to pass the first one, especially the 25% operating margin and gross margin to you. I couldn't be more pleased with the HP partnership. It's one we've been working on for several months before it came to fruition. And HP, as you know, is not a company that would do this without thought. The converged infrastructure in this market is changing rapidly. It's changing for compute. It's changing for storage. It's changing for networking. And quite frankly, it's a market that Arista has not played in. We could not have played in it without a major market partner like HP. HP is a leader in compute and storage. This is an acknowledgment of a best-of-breed network partner by HP. We're working very nicely in the converged infrastructure and really providing solutions of scale and high availability. We announced this partnership in HP Discover, I think, it was in June, right? So we've had about 4 to 6 weeks here now, and the pipeline and traction has been exciting. We've already had single-digit customer wins, and so I'd say it's a good start, but a long ways to go. Ita Brennan : And James, just to come back on the gross margin question. I think if you think about our long-term model in that 60% to 65% range, but as you'll see, our kind of near-term guidance, we're still sticking to the 63% to 65%. I think that's because we think that lower end of that range probably happens over multiple years. And obviously, in that time frame, we're also adding some capabilities, stuff like CloudVision, services growth. We'll see how all that plays out, but clearly, there's some puts and takes in both directions over time. So I think that's probably the way to think about it. In the near term, we're sticking to that 63% to 65%. In terms of operating margin, I think, the business model at 40% of revenues is still a good, solid way to think about it. We're growing into that, but we are making investments. We've investing in sales and marketing. We're investing internationally. I think 40% OpEx level is probably the right way to think about that piece of it. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. John- Michael McGrath : This is John-Michael for Sanjiv. I was wondering if you could provide us an update with the lawsuit against Cisco? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Hey, Marc, do you want to take that one as my General Counsel? Marc Taxay : Sure, I'd be happy to. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Marc Taxay : Thank you, Jayshree. So with respect to the ITC investigation, the schedule is as follows : the hearing for the 944 is going to begin on September 9 and continues through September 17. The hearing for the 945, the second investigation, will start on November 9 and continues through November 20. Our team has developed a good defensive strategy for the cases and were in the midst of preparing for trial today. We've also filed 7 IPR petitions, and we're currently awaiting the decision on those [indiscernible] as well. With respect to the copyright case, that trial date is set for August of 2016 of next year. We're also currently engaged in discovery for that case. As you recall, we also have the OptumSoft litigation right now. That has been bifurcated into 2 trials. The first will consist of a trial starting in September 14 of this year, where the court is going to determine ownership of the specific disputed software packages, and again, we developed a good defense for that case. And we're currently preparing for trial. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Marc. That was good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Ryan Hutchinson : So Jayshree, my question is around the Merchant Silicon strategy. Clearly, on the one hand, it gives you a significant time-to-market advantage. But on the other hand, the work we've done suggests that there could be some potential delays with the Broadcom Jericho chipset. So the question really is, one, is it true? And two, does it matter? And how would it impact your ability to move deeper into the routing opportunity that you've alluded to over the last several quarters as we look to 2016? Jayshree Ullal : Right. Thank you, Ryan. As you know, our strategy very much depends on excellent software running on different types of Merchant Silicon. Everybody gets access to the same Merchant Silicon. Arista has always been very unique in our ability to make that Merchant Silicon do unique things, whether it's with our drivers, our firmware, our customization, our deep understanding of silicon. We work with 3 types of silicon today. You pointed to one of them, Arad, which will be moving to Jericho. The Trident chipset, which has moved to T+ [Trident+], T2 [Trident II], name it; and also the Intel Alta chipset. And at any given time, we also have 1 or 2 others we're looking at. So Merchant Silicon and the life cycle and execution of those products and vendors is something we depend on, but we don't depend on only one architecture. We already have 3, and at any given time, we're looking at 2 others as well. So having been in the silicon industry many, many years ago, I can tell you I don't know a single chip that doesn't slip. And I can tell you there's not a single piece of software I know that doesn't have a bug. Those are just kind of normal ways of operating in engineering. So while it's not my place to comment on the expertise of those chips and why they slip, we do tend to accommodate that and generally doesn't affect our schedules and our product deliveries and our market plans because we account for them. And we always account for chip vendors having a metal spin or respin, et cetera. So in terms of addressing market, as Ryan, you and I have very much discussed, our total available market for the data center is $6 billion going to $12 billion. That is our primary and sole focus. Any adjacencies and additional things we do will come in the next few years, but we're not depending on them for chip or existing execution in our primary market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : First for Jayshree on the international mix. Can you share with us if the 23% of revenue from overseas customers included business with U.S. customers building out overseas and if you're starting to see incremental success with international accounts? And then for Ita, it looks like you saw a fairly large sequential and year-over-year increase in deferred revenues. So I was hoping to better understand some of the dynamics there. To what extent this reflects some short-term business that may have pushed out from Q2 to Q3? Or if it's all services, any additional input there would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jeff, for the good wishes. We're pleased with the international progress this quarter. So first, to clarify, the numbers I gave you were completely organic, so any of the cloud titans, et cetera, are not counted in the international numbers. All of the international numbers is organic growth, so that's a nice number. In terms of contribution, in Q1 it was very high from the cloud titans. In Q2, we actually saw contribution from new customer wins, particularly pleased with some wins in Asia-Pac and in Europe, but especially Asia-Pac. And so we're -- while we would like to see even more execution internationally, we're pleased with the hiring and the progress we're making there, given we really only started our efforts recently in the last 6 to 12 months. We've established subsidiaries in all the major countries. We've started active hiring in all of these countries, and I think we'll see some encouraging wins, hopefully, resembling the same 4 verticals that you see here in the U.S., internationally. Ita, you want to take the second part? Ita Brennan : Yes, so in terms of the deferred revenue, I mean, the vast majority of our deferred revenue is really services-related. I think if you look at the trends in deferred revenue over the last number of quarters, it has been ticking up nicely just based on the services growth, right, the growth in services. There is a smaller amount of product related to deferred revenue that's there, just related to some time-out type acceptance terms in some contracts. But again, the vast majority of it is in the services side. Jess Lubert : And is the growth end that we're seeing in services, the deferred growth, is that driven by some specific large projects? Is that how we should think about that? Jayshree Ullal : I think the way to think about it, Jeff, is tied to 5 million ports I just told you. We're now experiencing more service contract, service renewals and realization from that, that we didn't have. Jess Lubert : So higher attach rates versus necessarily bigger projects? Jayshree Ullal : Yes exactly, right. Ita Brennan : And then your renewals are kicking in, too, obviously. And you're having renewals happen -- with our growth rate, you're having renewals happen throughout the year more than maybe what you'd see in a more steady-state business where that would tend to be towards the end of the year. We have a steady kind of growth in renewals and revenue as well, right? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : I joined the call late, but my question is basically around revenue driver. Jayshree, this year, do you think all 4 verticals will be roughly equivalent again? Or will the cloud be much bigger than the others? And if you have any, how many above 10% customers did you have? Maybe you answered that one, but I just wanted to clear it up. Jayshree Ullal : Kulbinder, thank you. I was having trouble following about every other word, so I'm going to rephrase your question. Are you asking about the diversity in verticals this quarter? Or our forecast for next quarter? Kulbinder Garcha : How do you expect the year to end? Jayshree Ullal : Expect the year to end. Okay, got it. Well, we've had a very balanced first half, so --  and at the same time, I believe the -- one comment I really want to make on the cloud titans is it's not about one customer concentration. As you know, we are in 6 out of the 7 major cloud titans, and we're very pleased by the acceptance and expenditures of many cloud titans. So while we are deeply penetrated in -- one and especially Microsoft, we are pleased that the cloud titans, in general, are all growing. And as you know, they're large numbers, and if they grow, then that helps our numbers, too. But we're also seeing, as I said, this quarter, good wins in financials and high-tech enterprise. High-tech enterprise is comprised of many sub-verticals, if you will : the web services, software companies, high-tech companies that manufacture silicon. So it's a large catch-all bucket. So all 4 verticals, I expect through the year, will be well represented and diverse. They may be lumpy in the quarter, but so far, we haven't seen it this quarter or last quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs . Simona Jankowski : Jayshree, just a couple of questions. The first one is can you just give us an update on your EOS as a subscription product? And how that's going, what the early feedback had been? And then, as you know, Juniper recently announced its entry into the data center spine segments with 40 gig products. Can you just talk about how you view them as a competitor there? Jayshree Ullal : Right. On the EOS subscription product, I would say we have received small acceptance still, and it is mostly in entry-level smaller customers. They're not your typical big, large data centers. More trials, I would say, than large-scale production deployment. I think customers are still getting used to the model. They're -- it's not one they're familiar with. Their old 20-year old habit of just buying everything together, so it's only the SMB customers who want to try and buy or feel their way or have smaller budgets that are going in that direction for EOS. Specific to Juniper, I am not seeing anything different. We have a great deal of respect for our competition. We see Juniper in the core. We haven't seen them much in the data center. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC. Mark Sue : Jayshree, if we look at the growth opportunities ahead, is there a way you could rank order how we should see the TAM opportunities, expansion opportunities? Would it be international? Would it be new market agencies? Or how are you prioritizing your resources? That would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Right. Mark, I'm going to probably guess a little here, so I don't know if I have the perfect answer. But I would say our -- we have a four-pronged growth strategy towards our billion, first billion, let's say. And I would say they're fourfold. The first one is deepen in the 4 verticals. Most people think we're already there and we're achieving a lot from it, and while that's true, I would say we've barely scratched the surface of many. There's a lot of customers there. There's a lot of spend there, and there's a lot of awareness of Arista there. There's a lot of appreciation of our OS and our programmability there, so deepening in our verticals will give us the fastest and largest growth, I believe. The second is what you mentioned. I think the expansion to international -- we started frankly late, and we've been slow. We only really realistically started this year, so I think any expansion we do on the international to replicate what we've done in the U.S. will give us a growth potential in the next 3 to 5 years. And possibly, we also expect that our partnership with HP will give us expansion internationally, our technology partners, in general, including VMware. So the combination of our technology partners and international, I would agree with you, is a growth expansion strategy. The third one, I would say, is software subscription. Mark Sue : [Indiscernible] at a billion. Jayshree Ullal : While I don't think our software subscription will be material to our revenue short term, it's a very strategic part of our growth strategy. And Ita and I and the senior management team here value it deeply, and so do our customers. There's a lot less people and assets available to absorb technology and make technology work for you and cut cost that are both CapEx and OpEx, and so this is a key indicator for OpEx control. And finally, last but not least, I've always committed to you that our foremost and primary commitment is the data center, but we do not preclude adjacencies. We believe the data center is the primary and core market, but many of the adjacent markets will come to us. And that'll be a natural longer-term part of our prospect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. Maybe my imagination is playing the best of me, but I kind of think I'm hearing a little bit of contradiction in some of the discussions about verticals. It sounds like you've talked about balanced verticals in terms of all 4, but you also sound more constructive, more positive on web scale. The titans, you emphasized several rather than the one big one. I want to try to understand if and what may be changing among the web titans, and one of the things I'd like to get a better understanding of -- we're hearing some suggestion of maybe a shift away from white box switches for all applications and maybe embracing solutions like yours for the higher-end applications, and I'm really looking at the web scale guys other than Microsoft that clearly has already embraced Arista. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Simon. So first of all, no contradiction intended. The first quarter and the second quarter have shown good balance on our 4 verticals. If I had to cite the verticals that contributed the most, it would be the cloud titans and the service and cloud providers, but I don't want to underestimate how well the financials and enterprises have done. Their TAM and their spending is lower, but the acceptance of Arista in these general-purpose clouds as they build general-purpose data centers and private clouds, I'm very pleased with. So I don't mean that to be a contradiction. I think they're actually quite consistent. In terms of... Simon Leopold : And are you seeing them embracing your solutions rather than white box alternatives to a greater degree than they might have 6 months ago? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, so let me address that. So first of all, the first part of your question was, \"Did you have balance or did you not?\" And absolutely, we had balance, and I explained the top 2 verticals. In terms of white box, first of all, we do not see the white box at all in all 4 verticals. I just want to be clear on that. We have seen the white -- we have 30 -- 3,390 customers. I have seen the white box phenomena in maybe single-digit customers out of the 3,390. Just to be really clear. When we do see it, and this is something we're very cognizant of, all good organizations that have engineering capability will always have the right to experiment and will continue to experiment on single-use cases and what kind of cost they can get and what is core and what is context to them. So as I've explained before, Simon, in the Facebook example, we work with their internal implementations to enable value on Wedge and on their Xbox through our EOS. So if a company has white box, that doesn't mean it's mutually exclusive, and Arista can't be there. So to answer your question even more explicitly on the last 6 months, we have not seen an uptick in white box interest. It's been about the same. It tends to be single-digit customers, and it tends to be largely experiments and lag. There are very few instances of captive, production-based white box implementation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, I guess in part you just answered the question, but let me ask you a broader question on competitive landscape. And the direct question being, have you seen any meaningful change? I know you just addressed the white box piece of it, but obviously, there's Cisco and others. So any change there? And then -- I mean, it's not a question, but it's a statement. And I apologize to put you on the spot, but I'm doing it by design. And I know Ita just arrived, so my apologies, Ita. But I would strongly encourage you -- I understand why you don't want to do it. But I would strongly encourage you all for the benefit of investors, sell-side analysts and yourself to provide the vertical breakout, and not just in the general terms that you have. And I appreciate that in terms of your comments about the balance, but I think it would help us, and it would help you to provide the actual exact disclosure. With that said, I'll go back to the question about the competitive landscape. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Paul. Feedback taken, appreciate it. We'll definitely look into it. Regarding the competitive landscape, we have not seen significant change. We have had to compete in the last 6 quarters, I would say, more with paper tigers than with reality. In the last recent quarters, as the products come to market, it has actually strengthened the conviction of our customers even more that we have the best platform and product. And what I mean by that is not just speeds and speeds and buffering and latency and power and all of that good stuff that we derive from our chip, but really, the programmability of our software stack and the 10-year endeavor we put into that. No one is coming close. A lot of people use the words scripting, programmability, DevOps, NetOps. No one has come close to actually implementing the level of depth. And it's reflected, Paul, as you well know, in our R&D investment, which is top and most significant investment. So while it can look on paper like people have caught up, when people actually evaluate our product, we technically win 9 out of 10x, maybe 10x out of 10x, technically. Paul Silverstein : And so beyond the technical aspect, if we looked at your win rate -- and I appreciate it's not just about technicals, but if we looked at your win rate, has there been any change for better or worse? Jayshree Ullal : No, there's been -- I think our win rate has been equal or better. Now understand that with our coverage, we probably don't see everything, so I can only speak to what we see. But in the scope of what we see, our win rate is equal or better. Paul Silverstein : One final related question. In terms of the pricing environment, any meaningful change? Jayshree Ullal : No, I was just looking at the ASP trends. So no, they haven't changed much in the last 2, 3 quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Erik Suppiger : So first off, for Marc on the legal proceedings. I think you're going to court twice in September. How quick do you expect the courts to come back with their decisions on the patents and the infringement? And then secondly, you're halfway through the year now. In the past, you've talked about Microsoft as a customer that would come down as a percentage of revenue but continue to grow in terms of dollars. I'm just checking, is that still your expectation for 2015? Would you expect the dollar sales to Microsoft to continue growing year-on-year? Jayshree Ullal : Marc, you want to take the legal question? Or do you want me do the Microsoft one first? Marc Taxay : You can take Microsoft. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, so I'll answer the second question first while I still remember the answer. So Eric, Microsoft continues to be an extremely important top customer for Arista. Very strategic. We expect this -- we've generally said we expect this trend to be flat to slightly down or flat to slightly up. At the moment, I would say we're feeling better about flat to slightly up. Erik Suppiger : Are you talking about in terms of dollars when you say that? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I'm talking strictly about dollars. Obviously, they'll continue to come down as a percentage of our overall revenue because they're growing, and -- but as a spend in dollars, we feel good about this spend, and we feel that their investment in the cloud is having a direct correlation to their investment in Arista. Marc? Marc Taxay : Sure. With respect to the timing, so with the ITC, as you know, the first case is in the 944. That's going to happen through September. The administrative law judge decision for that, the initial determination occurs January 27, 2016. And then it goes to the commission, and the commission makes a decision on May 27. And then that goes to a presidential review of 60 days. That gets to July 27. The 945 case in November, that initial determination by the administrative law judge doesn't occur until April 26 of next year. Final determination by the commission is August 26, and then the presidential review of that isn't until October 26, 2016. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so a long ways here. Another year or 1.5 years ahead of us, right? So Marc, despite all of the overheated rhetoric we've been hearing from Cisco's blog about Arista's brazen copying, we think the only thing brazen about this case is the extreme length Cisco has gone to, right? Our customers have shown unwavering support. Marc Taxay : Yes, I think that's right, Jayshree. I think, ironically, one of the things that we find interesting about this case is that it appears to us, anyway, that Cisco's behaving very much like a patent troll, which is pretty much what they've spent the last decade condemning. They're choosing to observe patents against widely-implemented, industry-standard feature functionality that exists in all network switches today, and they're twisting the language of some of the patents to attack features that the patents were never intended to cover. So we just -- we find this an ironic strategy. Erik Suppiger : When you talk about those decisions, though, for the Markman hearings, when would they be coming back to determine which patents are applicable for the case? Marc Taxay : So well, with respect to the Markman, actually, that -- you're asking about the Markman? Or you're asking about the decisions by the judge with respect to the trial? Erik Suppiger : The Markman. Jayshree Ullal : They're different. Marc Taxay : Yes, so on the Markman case, that -- the Markman  trial was for the 945, and only [indiscernible] to 2 investigations. We're still waiting on the Markman order. That would apply to the 6 patents that are in the 945 case. The decisions on those should occur, we expect, sometime within the next couple of weeks. And then those would apply to the 945 hearing that we're going to be having in November. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Calling on behalf of Brian. Jayshree, a question on the Tomahawk, we get asked this question a lot by clients. Give us some understanding of the waterfall and the product cycle you see for Tomahawk. Do you think the product cycle starts kicking in from the fourth quarter and in that case, you would see an above seasonal Q1 of '16 with more 100 gig ports in the mix? And in general, on a full year basis next year, how would you view 100 gig approximately as a percentage of your mix? Because clearly, you have your customers, especially the cloud titans, doing 100 gig both in the leaf and in the spine. Jayshree Ullal : Right, yes, good question, Vijay. I think both transitions will be slow and gradual, and it will be multi-quarters. It won't be just overnight in Q1 2016. In general, speed transitions take time, as you know, Vijay. I mean, we may realistically think they should happen, but the time from when they decided to happen to when a customer actually makes it happen is much longer. So I think Tomahawk and 100 gigabit in the spine will happen throughout 2016, and for that matter, 2017. Vijay Bhagavath : Perfect. A then a quick follow-on would be on data center routing with new Merchant Silicon like Jericho. Any thoughts on the product cycle ramp? Would that be second half of next year? Give us your view. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, so we haven't really commented on our  WAN and adjacency strategies, and we look to do that in the future when we're ready. But in general, I think what you're seeing here is that traditional networks, where you build switches in the campus and routers and the WAN and branches with routers, et cetera, all these what's often called places in the network are coming together. And I think you're seeing much more of an integrated, seamless pin structure, and so I think is going to apply to the WAN 2 as interfaces move more and more to Ethernet and routers move more and more to routing, and the noun becomes an adjective, if you will. These will not be market segments, and the existing companies may see their TAM shrink as these become features on products. So we see the spine as becoming a very relevant platform for the data center and cloud today, but we don't preclude the possibility of other features such as routing, especially, as you pointed out, the modern silicon coming. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I was curious about the 5 million port milestone. I think if I have this correct, you passed both the 4 million and 5 million port milestones this quarter. Is that correct? Jayshree Ullal : That's correct. We -- I think the last time -- good observation, George. You're the only one who caught it, so we got to give you an award. But we announced the 3 million, and we never announced the 4 million. And we went straight to 5 million, and maybe we should go straight to 7 million or 10 million next time. But it shows the velocity and acceptance of our ports and the migration to high speed. It's happening in our... George Notter : Got it. Okay. And then I guess the real question behind this is, again, I think if I have it correct, it took you 3 quarters to pass, effectively, the 4 million port mark because then 3 quarters... Jayshree Ullal : No, no no. It took me -- what I tried to say, maybe I got too cute with it. I'll try again. It took us 4 years, 48 months, to do our first 4 million ports. So from inception, basically end of 2008 to now. The first 4 million ports took us 48 months. The last million port took us 1/10 that time, less than 4.8 months. George Notter : Got it. Okay. I guess, my understanding is that for the September quarter, you were north of 3 million ports. You're also north of 3 million in the December quarter and also into the March quarter, so it took you those 3 quarters to ship an additional million ports and yet just in the June quarter, you shipped a million ports. And so I'm wondering if there's something that's going on here in terms of pricing because, yes, I'm not seeing -- I'm seeing certain -- lots and lots of growth certainly in the June quarter, but it seems like the port shipments relative to revenue were much bigger. So I'm just wondering if there's anything that's changed on pricing. That's just the question. Jayshree Ullal : No. I think the one fact that's incorrect in your assumption is we didn't stay at 3 million ports for full quarter. We just didn't report when the 4 million happened. George Notter : Got it. Okay. I think you just told us it happened in the June quarter as well as the passage of the 5 million milestones. Jayshree Ullal : No, we just went straight from 3 million to 5 million, and we reported the cumulative being 5 million. But don't assume all 2 million ports happened in one quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. John- Michael McGrath : I just had another quick question on whether or not there was a 10% customer in the quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, we don't comment on 10% customers in the quarter, but the answer is no. Chuck Elliott : All right. This concludes the Arista Q2 2015 Earnings Call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional perspective on our Q2 2015 fiscal results, which you can access from the Investor section of our websites. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2015 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically on our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use in this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our Q3 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report our sixth consecutive beat as a public company. Consistent with prior quarters, customer demand for our 7000 Series, the U.S.-based products drove results that exceeded the consensus. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 78% of our sales, and 22% was derived internationally from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific theaters. We are witnessing balanced traction across our familiar 4 verticals : our Cloud Titans, Financials, High-Tech Enterprises and Web and Service Providers.  Revenue grew 40% year-over-year to a record $217.5 million. Service contributed in the double digits at 11% of overall revenue, including software subscriptions. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 65.5%, resulting in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59, thus growing EPS in excess of 40% year-over-year in our competitive and dynamic industry. We now have over 3,500 customers with our continued trend of 1 to 2 new customers per day. This quarter, we had a number of key highlights. Our progress with the HP partnership via demonstrations at VMWorld 2015 of converged solutions with HP Openview continues. We introduced next-generation leaf switch platform based on Broadcom's much anticipated Tomahawk silicon for flexible 10, 25, 40, 50 and 100-gigabit Ethernet switches, with hitless Smart System Upgrade capabilities. Our new products were endorsed by a number of our ecosystem partners at an NYC event we held on September 14, 2015. We do expect the next year to fuel the demand for 25, 50 and 100-gigabit Ethernet upgrades.  We unveiled a strategic security architecture for cloud networking called Macro-Segmentation Services, or MSS for short. Our CloudVision MSS has been endorsed by many new and existing security leaders, including VMware, Palo Alto Networks, F5, Check Point and Fortinet. MSS delivers improved risk mitigation and compliance and enables a new unified firewall policy for both physical and virtual worlds, utilizing the rich programmability of Arista EOS.  Speaking of partners, we have strong supporters of open source community initiatives, such as Microsoft's ACS and HP's Open Switch, both are setting examples of the open source stacks familiar to what Facebook's FBOSS was announced last year, and they complement our award-winning EOS. In Q3, TechTarget also recognized us with an innovation award for Arista EOS.  This month, we formalized the technical advisory board at SMPTPE ( sic ) [ SMPTE ] 2016 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers for media and entertainment with the participation of Fox and Imagine among many important industry participants. We believe the migration from analog broadcasting to digital IP is a very important development for modern workstream.  As we witness the mega consolidation of large IT suppliers, many of my blogs and prior predictions ring true. New nimble pioneers like Arista are leading the transformation from legacy and closed systems to this third wave of open cloud and converged platforms. Arista has been a thought leader of this throughout, and follows a strategic imperative from customers to shift from siloed IT to universal and programmable clouds.  As we reflect our midyear 2015 market data report, Arista's evolution and leadership in market share has grown from single-digit 7% in mid-2013 to double-digit 12% in mid-2015 in the relevant 10, 40 and 100-gigabit data center switch port category. Clearly, we are outpacing the industry average growth. We feel poised to accomplish $1 billion run rate next year, a year earlier than originally predicted.  In summary, I would like to say that I'm pleased with our differentiated cloud assets and overall class team to achieve this. It positions us uniquely in the year and the decade ahead.  Ita, I'd now like to turn it over to you, our CFO, for Q3 2015 financial detail. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 '15 is based on non-GAAP, and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation expenses, legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits, and the release of a GAAP tax reserve as described below. A reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q3 were $217.5 million, up 40% year-over-year and comfortably above our guidance of $208 million to $212 million.  We experienced good momentum in the quarter with revenue contributions balanced across our key verticals. Service revenues continue to tick upward at 11.1% of revenue for the quarter. International revenues came in at $47 million or 22% of total revenue, down from 23% last quarter. We experienced continued growth in EMEA, offset by some lumpiness in APAC related to some large deals recorded last quarter. While we continue to focus on expanding our international footprints, you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployments. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 65.5%, down slightly from Q2 at 65.8%, and just above the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $83.1 million, up from $74.7 million last quarter. This increase in spending was largely related to increased personnel and prototype expenses for R&D. We continued to grow our sales and marketing headcount in the quarter, but these increase personnel costs were offset by some reductions in demo and other marketing expenses. Overall spending was 38% of revenue consistent with last quarter with expenses growing at the same rate as revenue and investments being funded by top line growth.  Our operating income for the quarter was $59.5 million, or 27.3% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.7 million and our effective tax rate was 27.3%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $42.4 million or 19.5%.  Our diluted share number for the quarter was 71.9 million, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $0.59, up from $0.54 in the prior quarter and up 48% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $15.9 million for the quarter, slightly above our outlook of $15 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above.  For those of you focusing on our GAAP results, you will notice that our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis came in at 6.1%, down from 26% last quarter. This reduced tax rate results from the release of some GAAP tax reserves related to an uncertain tax position, those the statutes of limitations have now expired. We've excluded this effects of our non-GAAP results and keeping with our view that the non-GAAP numbers should present ongoing business trend. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $568.6 million. We generated $10.6 million of cash from operations in the September quarter, down from $52.6 million in the prior period. The reduction in cash generated largely resulted from an increase in accounts receivable due to reduced collections in the period. This does not reflect any changes in overall credit metrics or business linearity. It was directly related to some personnel and system changes during the quarter. We would expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter.  DSOs came in at 68 days, up from 57 last quarter. Inventory turns were 2.6x, down slightly from 2.7x in Q2.  Inventory increased to $110 million in the quarter, up from $100 million in the prior period. Raw materials increased by $11.5 million, reflecting growth in shipped inventories in advance of ramping new products. This growth was offset by some reduction in finished goods.  Our deferred revenue balance was $191 million, up from $164 million in Q2. This balance continues to be largely made up of short- and long-term service contracts with some product deferrals related to acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts Payable days were 38 days, down from 59 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.2 million. Now turning to our guidance and outlook for the fourth quarter. We are pleased with our year-to-date financial performance with revenues up 44% and earnings per share up 52% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to increase our market share and gain traction across key verticals and customers. Based on current visibility, we expect our Titan to vertical contribute strongly to revenues in the December quarter. A meaningful mix towards these larger customers will likely result in gross margins at the lower end of our typical 63% to 65% range.  Consistent with prior quarters, we will continue to leverage the growth of the business to fund investments in sales and marketing and R&D.  With this as backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expense associated with the ongoing lawsuit is as follows : Revenues of approximately $238 million to $242 million, gross margins of approximately 62% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 26%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 28% to 30%, with diluted shares of approximately 72.5 million. Please note that based on our current understanding, we expect the cost associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $10 million for the quarter, down from last quarter's peak of $15.9 million. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, all. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : If I look at your results in the pipeline, it seems the runway is still lengthening for you and in terms of the opportunity. So in terms of how you're planning your growth related to a headcount and opportunity and TEM expansion, are we at the point where we could see additional verticals being added to Arista? Or are we at the point where we could add more channels to Arista? Just how we could kind of frame the outlook considering you're right around touching your run rate of $1 billion now? Jayshree Ullal : We don't see any dramatic change in our run rate. We're very pleased with what I classify as 2 categories of customers we're serving. One is the cloud customers, which is our top 4 verticals. And the other is the converged customers through our partnerships, we can handle a lot of verticals that are not mentioned in the top 4, but are still addressed through our partnerships with HP, VMware and a number of others. So our 2 thematic focuses are really cloud platforms, where our top 4 verticals are something we directly and intimately deal with, and then converged platforms, where we work many times through technology partners not just channel partners and they address a number of verticals. As I said on the call, one of the meaningful verticals for us that we look to address and today, we largely group into high-tech enterprise is media and entertainment. We see that as very important vertical that appreciates the performance, the software's capabilities and the cloud characteristics are very similar and they're handling a lot of performance and workstream. So our pipeline is very solid, and we continue to focus beyond the 4 verticals, but the 4 verticals have a lot of penetration left in them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Inder Singh of SunTrust. Inder Singh : I wanted to just ask you about your operating margin performance, which really has been outpacing, I think, some of the guidance that you've been giving over the last few quarters may be more. It's been running 200 basis points or so higher than your guidance, yet you feel that there's some cautiousness or something that you are trying to factor into your guidance. Is there something that in particular that causes you to be that cautious? Or is it just conservatism in terms of your guidance around operating margin? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Inder. First of all, I would say that we want to make sure as a company, and this is our philosophy, I think, I've shared it with you all many times that we are peddled to the metal on R&D and we leave no stone unturned in terms of innovation. So we continue to allow a generous investment in R&D, much higher than the industry averages, as you know, and in terms of percentage of revenue. Now we haven't always been able to meet it, because we don't want to reduce the caliber of our hiring. Our often prototype expenses that we foresee in a given quarter slide out, because the chips are not available. So we're not going to waste money just because we want to spend money. So our R&D will continue to be high in the 20s, in percentage, as a function of revenue, but obviously, as our revenue is growing fast, we're not always spending as fast. But we plan to spend it. We continue to want to invest there. Sales and marketing, a little bit different. As you know, we've had a very targeted sales and marketing focus. In fact, I will tell you that in terms of quality, we're putting a higher priority on this and flushing out the nonperformers. And over there, our spending has been low and once again, below the targets we intended for 2 reasons. We want to keep the quality high, but also there, we're leveraging a lot of our technology partners. So we want to plan for the spending, but not necessarily spend for the heck of it. And that's what you're seeing in the last few quarters. Ita, maybe you want to add something there. Ita Brennan : Yes, the only thing I'd add in to is, some of that out-performance is, obviously, been coming from the gross margin line as well where we've been forseeing and -- hitting the upper end of that range. And I would say for this quarter we provided some color in my script, but I do -- I think we see at least based on what we can see now that there is a mix towards those larger customers this quarter. So I would expect the gross margin line to really come in line with the guidance just because we see that trend already. Jayshree Ullal : Good point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Jeffrey Kvaal : I have a question about the broader outlook for some of your top verticals. I think some of your end customers or some of their peers have started to talk about being a little bit more careful with their CapEx spending over the course of the next few years. Could you help us understand what you are seeing from the cloud Titans, in particular? And, in particular, I guess, it would be helpful if you would allow us to understand which applications are the ones that typically drive the most purchasing for you, whether it's search or video or advertising or public cloud or what have you? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, thanks, Jeff, I'll try my best. First of all, the interest from the cloud Titans has been very high, and the growth has been unabated. And that's why we are forecasting a very strong cloud Titan quarter for Q4. We are in 7 -- 6 out of 7 cloud Titans in the U.S, and we continue to make some progress internationally as well. And while not all 6 show up every quarter, and especially the last 3 quarters have been very balanced, we think we will see some lumpiness in the direction of more cloud Titan spending if not less the next few quarters. So we're not seeing what the others are seeing. The acceptance of the cloud Titans to Arista has been particularly consistent and strong. It varies by quarter. It's always lumpy. And as Ita pointed out, if they buy too much, then it will affect our gross margin, but it's been healthy. Now in terms of applications, they tend to be very dense computing, very large scale out storage. They are definitely more geared to the public cloud. There are some hybrid cloud applications as well, but I would say, more on the public side than in the private. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese of MKM Partners. Michael Genovese : Could you talk about the importance of 25 and 50G? And is there any of that uplift in average selling price, perhaps in the fourth quarter guide? Or is it really a 2016 event to see 25 and 50? Jayshree Ullal : Michael, I think all these speed upgrades take longer to happen than when the products are available. So the effect of 25 and 50, I'm going to forecast is more real in 2016 than Q4. We'll see some small perturbations, but to put this in perspective, it's taken 10 years for 10-gig to become mainstream. I'm not predicting 25 and 50 years for 25 and 50-gig, but it does take time. In terms of pricing, you do not see significant price upticks. You'll see mild maybe, but most people expect higher performance for, I guess, less ASP degradation is the way to say it. Michael Genovese : Yes, I mean, as long as if you haven't moved on yet, I will ask a follow-up. Could you just on update on the lawsuits, the 3 that you were going on in the last quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Sorry, what was the question? We didn't understand it. Michael Genovese : I'm sorry, the question is about the lawsuits, if you could give us an update on the 3 cases that were in the courts last quarter or, and what's going on with them? Ita Brennan : I am going to turn over to my expert General Counsel, Marc, are you ready to answer that question? Marc Taxay : Sure, I'd be happy to answer. So as you point out, we had several cases that went on last quarter. The first was in the ITC, we called the 944 investigation. That trial was completed in September. Since one of the patents accused in that case was dropped, that means there are 5 patents that are remaining in that case that need to be decided upon. We expect Judge Shaw to issue his initial determination on that case on January 27, 2016. What happens next is of that the ITC commission then reviews that initial determination and issues a final determination on May 27, 2016. That then goes to the U.S. Trade Representative who makes the final decision on the case on July 27, 2016. The second case in the ITC is the 945 investigation, that actually goes to trial on November 9, on Monday, lasting through November 20. Following that trial, the administrative law judge McNamara, is scheduled to issue her initial determination on that case on April 26, 2016. That then goes to the full ITC commission, he reviews the initial determination and issues their final determination on August 26. And then finally, the U.S. trade representative makes the final decision on October 26 of next year. That's the status of each of the 2 ITC cases. As a reminder, there is also the copyright case in that, and that's ongoing as well, and that is scheduled -- that continues to be scheduled of August 2016, and we're currently in discovery in that case. Just to aid the investor community, what we're doing is we're going to put out on our website, our investor website, a document that sets forth all of the key dates in the trial. So you can refer to that if you need the specifics. The last case that we worked on was the OptumSoft case. The first phase of that lawsuit, the trial occurred in September. There is no scheduled date for a decision by the judge, but we would expect one probably within the next 6 weeks or so towards the end of November, and we'll obviously be waiting on that. The second phase of that lawsuit is currently scheduled for April of 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Quick question. On DSOs, I'd like to get any color on that? And then also on gross margins, it was slightly [indiscernible] expectation on your guidance, was that mix-related? Or is that just price aggressiveness into the cloud Titans? Ita Brennan : Yes, so I think the DSOs is really just mechanical collections activities. In the quarter, we had some turn over in the team, et cetera. So I expect that to come right back in Q4 and, in fact, we can see that happening already. So there's nothing more there than just sheer execution. Yes, in terms of gross margin, I think, for Q3, we were actually at the upper end, above the upper end of our guide. And then in Q4, we are guiding to the lower end of that typical range, and that is really all based around the mix of Titans that we expect to see in the revenue in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Just one clarification and a question. The clarification, any 10% customers in the quarter? And the question I had was, Jayshree, when you look at 25, 50 gig, understanding that it's a 2016 event in terms of demand, is it mainly going to come from the cloud titan? So do you see a lot of your financials and other verticals also picking up 25, 50 gig? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Sanjiv. So first of all, there was no 10% concentration this quarter. As we said, we don't really reflect any concentration on a per quarter. We like to report that on the year. But there was none, to answer your question directly. And in terms of 25, 50, the biggest uptick we do see and interest we do see is for storage and compute applications in the cloud. So that is the primary application. But we don't preclude interest in many cloud-like enterprise and financial and web and service provider customers. So we do see a sprinkling of interest across all 4 verticals. But I would say, the concentration of interest is coming from the cloud, to answer your question. Now one common interest we see across all 4 verticals is the 100 gig. Everybody's looking for a 100 gig spine from Arista, and Arista is very uniquely qualified in building the best spine platform. Vijay Bhagavath : Got it. Jayshree, one quick question on Microsoft, given that they haven't been a 10% customer for 2 quarters now. Do you expect it to be up for this year compared to last year? Jayshree Ullal : I've always projected that they will be flattish and as the year ends, we will definitely give any guidance and information on customer concentration. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Hutchinson of Guggenheim. Ryan Hutchinson : Jayshree, my question is on guidance. So just, obviously, no slowdown in sight with strong growth from the cloud titan. But as we think about '16, specifically Q1, should we take into consideration typical seasonality witnessed by other networking, security and storage vendors, especially given the above consensus guidance that you gave this afternoon? And the reason I asked is, prior to this release, consensus estimates imply flattish to slightly up revenue entering the new year, and I just want to make sure that we're appropriately modeling Q1 at the right level. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ryan. I appreciate it. Yes. So I think we have signaled a strong Q4 guidance. Obviously, Ita and I will talk about Q1 guidance in Q4. However, if you look at our last few years and history, we've always had a seasonally weak Q1, and we've generally tended to be flat to down. So I wouldn't read anything into it except when we have a strong Q4, we generally have a weaker Q1, and then we pick up the pace in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So I think that's just good modeling for you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz of the Sterne CRT. Alex Kurtz : So Jayshree, just back on the litigation issues. How are you working with the sales organization to mitigate the impact on this, around pipeline with existing customers, new customers and just sort of how people are thinking about big purchases going into the first half of '16 around this specific issue? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, no, thank you Alex and thanks for your wishes. I've said this before, and I'll say it emphatically again, the lawsuit has not had a dramatic negative impact on our sales momentum and customer revenue. That's because our customers are smart, and they understand that while there are risks, that there is deep appreciation for our technology advantages and also our commitment to assure continuous supply through workarounds in a variety of ways. So the way we would address it is as factually as we address it with you all. We explained the risks. We explained our advantages. We explained the possibilities of workarounds, and get them comfortable. Marc, I don't know if you want to add something. You've joined me on many of these customer calls. Marc Taxay : No, I think that's right, Jayshree. I think -- yes, I think the focus right now is to continue to defend ourselves in the case and to create a mitigation strategy in the event that there's a negative outcome. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto of Gabelli & Company. Hendi Susanto : I would like to clarify your expectation of strong cloud titan performance in Q4. Will that be concentrated in Q4 or will be a multiple quarter rollout? Additionally, like, what are some of the major applications that the cloud titans will be engaging in Q4? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Hendi. I think I answered the cloud application question as best I could. A lot of focus on scale-out storage, compute and public cloud deployments, largely leaf and spine, with really dense computing, thousands of servers, petabytes of storage, et cetera. In terms of any further guidance beyond Q4, the best I could say is they're confident of $1 billion run rate in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. I wanted to ask a little bit about the VMware, HP and the Dell partnerships that you mentioned before. Can you just give us more color around how that's progressing and may help us assess the prospects and timing for each. And maybe I think it would be helpful if you could give us maybe a sense of the ranking of them by significance? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I never like to pick favorites among my children so don't make me do that. But definitely, I would say our progress with HP and VMware is stronger than the others. Palo Alto, I would say is the other -- these 3 have been ones we've been working very closely with. And each of them have their unique nuances and technological advantages. With VMware, we have 6 or 7 levels of integration. Most people just focus on NSX and VXLAN, but we're very partnered with them on their cloud initiative, on their monitoring initiative, on their ESX and mainstream vSphere initiative. So our partnership with VMware continues to be very robust, especially as it relates to virtual to physical to cloud networking. And more recently, we also introduced security initiatives with both VMware and Palo Alto. In terms of HP, a real focus on converged infrastructure. We see a class of customers that just want their compute, their storage and their network together and really bringing these best-of-breed components, and this definitely includes Arista as their networking component and HP as their compute component and sometimes storage. So that would be the 2 examples I would give you. In terms of Dell, we've done some work with them on CloudVision integration and ASM integration. And things have just gotten started over there, so it's very early and time will tell. Victor Chiu : Okay, great. And the timing for the other ones? Jayshree Ullal : I'm sorry, timing for... Victor Chiu : The, I guess, timing for when VMware, HP, et cetera might become more material? Jayshree Ullal : Oh, more material. Well, the -- we started to see wins with both VMware and HP in 2015, and I believe we'll continue to see that in 2016 and '17. So the timing has already begun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Fahad Najam : This is Fahad in for Paul. Can you provide some quantification as to the level of diversification, amongst the top 4 verticals, what was the distribution across these verticals? Jayshree Ullal : We don't intend to break it out, Fahad. But as I've said, they were very balanced so you can assume all of them were double-digit percentages. Fahad Najam : Okay. And one question on the competitive front. As you introduced CloudVision and this Micro-Segmentation service, it appears that you're increasingly getting the NSX space or the VMware. How do you manage any potential channel conflicts? And do you envision any material -- as you move forward with your vision, those coming to conflict with your biggest channel partners? Jayshree Ullal : No, not at all. There is absolutely no overlap and competition with VMware's Micro-Segmentation and Arista's MSS. So just to be clear, VMware's Micro-Segmentation is fine-grained security and firewall policy at a virtual machine level. Arista doesn't do any of that. That gets mapped into their v switch, and Arista picks up where they leave off and really provide east-west security mitigation and risk compliance between the VMworld and the firewall policies that may be coming from Palo Alto or F5 or Fortinet or Check Point. So there's a lot of talk about security threat. But even after you catch them, you have to prevent them from spreading. And that's really where Arista comes in. So we're really bridging the gap between NSX, Micro-Segmentation and existing firewall rules and policies, which tend to be more north-south, and have done some very deep integration with both NSX and Panorama from Palo Alto. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lucia from JMP Securities. John Lucia : Jayshree, you indicated Arista benefited from software subscriptions in the quarter. What was the makeup of those subscriptions? What services were those? And then can you talk about, just in general, how you expect software subscriptions to trend as a percentage of revenue in the long term for Arista? And then I have a quick follow-up, how many salespeople did you add in the quarter? Jayshree Ullal : I'll take your second question, first. We don't tend to give out specific numbers, so that's easy, I won't tell you, but thanks, John. But on the software subscription, I think this is a long-term vision and strategy that we're developing. This is very well understood in the security world, but it's only just now forming in the cloud networking world. And CloudVision is clearly our first example of that. And what -- the uptake you're seeing, I mean, obviously, we're getting strength and strong acceptance of CloudVision, both in terms of customers and bookings. But by the time we realize this into revenue and billings, we'll have a delayed factor because these are long-term subscriptions. So I expect in the long term, long term envisioned by 1 to 3 years, for CloudVision and software subscriptions to be a greater component. Until then, I think we will be in the 10% to 12%. But this could give us a reason to get into the teens in the future. John Lucia : You said in titan, you'd be 10% to 12%. Is that like in a year you'd be 10% to 12%? Or is that in the next couple of quarters? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, 10% to 12% of total revenue, as we said... Ita Brennan : Including services, right? Jayshree Ullal : Right, including services. So services and software subscription will continue to hover in the 10% to 12% range of total revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : Just 2. One of them is basically on the issue of workarounds for the ongoing litigation, where are we in the process? And how are you guys managing that basically? I guess you have to first, well, be informed in terms of what kind of workaround you need? And then how are you going to communicate it to your customers? And what's the time line? Anything on that would be helpful. And the second is probably a little bit easy. On gross margin, maybe this is for Jayshree a little bit, Arista executed very well versus you've always flagged that gross margins might trickle down. There would be this mix shift towards cloud, maybe a little bit in some quarters. But you executed well against that. We've seen a slight decline now over the last year and a bit. I guess what are the positive drivers in gross margin that you're implementing to offset that over the longer term. If you're cloud business is very significant, there should be some positive initiatives, I guess, in place. The software and services seems like a very -- software seemed like a very long-term issue, but is there anything in next year, whether it's a product refresh or other things in the positive side we should think about? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, so there's 2 questions. The first one, on workaround, as you can imagine, we are putting in place contingencies for the workarounds, and there's a very strong engineering focus. Marc, do you want add to the workaround piece? Marc Taxay : Sure. Yes, so to Jayshree's point, we actually developed to a greater or lesser degree design around for each of the patents in the event that there's an adverse outcome. Some of them have actually been implemented already. Others are in the process of being implemented, and frankly, a big part of the litigation process of course is to understand the nature of the claims that are being asserted. And so it's a moving thing, as we see how these are litigated. And I would expect significant effort in the first half of next year. Jayshree Ullal : Right. So on -- thank you, Marc. On gross margin, as Ita has often said, if we have a lot of cloud titan spend, then our gross margins of $60 million to $65 million will tend to favor less $65 million and more in the early 60s. If we get the mix right, and that's why you've seen us do so well, because the last 3 quarters, they have been very balanced quarters. Clearly, while the software and services will contribute in the longer term, we also have a third component, which is product mix. And we will continue to do aggressive cost reduction, and the increase of 100 gig into our mix will improve our margins as well. So for all those reasons, I think we'll always be in that $60 million to $65 million range, trying hard to be more in the $62 million to $65 million in the near term rather than less than that. And we feel comfortable that we've got enough levers to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the benefits of the 25 and 100G products in 2016. Should we expect that they will grow kind of in line with the natural growth rate that you guys have been seeing that has to do with growth in the addressable market plus your share gains? Or is there an opportunity or how much of an opportunity is there for incremental acceleration on the back of replacing existing parts of the deployed base? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, James. I clearly -- it's difficult to predict the port mix of what will grow faster and what won't because it's very customer-dependent. But maybe I step back and share with you some of the Dell'Oro and Crehan data. I think what's clear is 10 gig will be more steady. 40 gig may actually come down over time. I don't know if it's exactly 2016, but if I look in 3 years, 40 gig is projected to come down. 25, 50 and definitely 100 gig are the high-growth areas. And so the mix of all of that, we absolutely predict will be double-digit growth for us in the foreseeable future. So we're less hung up on port mix. We look at this as high-performance ports. In fact, sometimes, we don't even know how our customer might break out a port. They may take a 40 gig and break it out into four 10s. And the same thing with 100. They may break it out into two 50s or ten 10s or whatever. But I think takeaway from this is the common denominator is increments of 10 gig Ethernet, and one thing we're definitely seeing in especially our 4 verticals is the need for 100 gig spine as a common denominator. And then whether host connect to 1 or 10 or 25 or 50 seems to depend on the use case and applications. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : I had a couple of questions on 25 and 50 gig as well. I guess the first one is, it looks like there's going to be maybe 5 or so vendors with products in that category. So just wanted to see how you view the competitive landscape there versus what you've been dealing with so far? And then as far as pricing is concerned, on a per gig basis, it looks like one of the big advantages is that you're going to be able to get much, much lower price per gig. So how do you think about that from an overall revenue and margin perspective? And then just lastly, would you expect any customers to pause and wait for these products? Or do you think 40 and 100 gig is going to go -- is going to continue to see high demand right up until these products become available? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Simona. There's actually 3 questions there so I'll do my best to address 1a, 1b, 1c, right? So 1a, 25 and 50 gig, there's 5 vendors -- there's always been 5 vendors for us in every performance metric. I don't think it's unique to 25 gig. Of all the competitors we have, the largest monopoly is, obviously, Cisco. And then as is often referred to in our industry, there is Cisco and many dwarfs [ph]. And obviously, Arista is clearly now identified as the clear alternative in the data center. So we see that playing out for all the other performance metrics as well. We don't see anything unique. And some of the standouts for us is our high availability architecture, our highly programmable software, our ability to do SSU and hitless upgrade, ability to really deliver features at fierce velocity, not compromising the rapid use of merchant silicon. Everybody has access to the same silicon, but we develop a much, much better and much more technical superior product and, many times, command a price premium for that. To come to your second question, on price per port. We have seen ASPs stabilize in the 10 gig, and we do see that 25, 50 and 100 gig will -- the ASPs will depend greatly on volume just like they did on 10. And also, a real opportunity and issue is the optics, the interconnect optics for these 100 gigs, right? So we see that those often can be more expensive than the port itself. So stay tuned for Arista to really offer some important alternatives, both embedded, integrated and different types of transit options. So I think price per port, especially taking into consideration the interconnects between these ports, you will see some ASP fluctuation but even improvement. And then -- I've forgotten your third question. Paul Silverstein : Oh, just if you might see any kind of pause in demand as customers waiting for these or... Jayshree Ullal : Oh, yes. At the moment, it's hard to tell that we see any pause. The publicity on, for example, Tomahawk silicon in 25, 50 gig has been going on for a year, and that has caused us no pause. I think our customers expect these speed transitions. If anything, it validates Ethernet as the foundation for all networking connectivity. And so they'll use what we have now and wait for what we have in the next quarter. And especially, in our top 4 verticals, I've rarely seen them just pause if they need to absorb technology and keep their networks running. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : I also wanted to ask 2 questions. First, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the outlook internationally, and to what degree you believe the safe harbor rulings may cause some of your U.S. cloud titan customers to accelerate international data center deployments in 2016 and beyond. To what degree you have the infrastructure in place to capture that opportunity? And then second, our research suggests that Arista may be getting close to launching a DWDM line card to directly address the data center interconnect market. So I was hoping to better understand the opportunity you see there and what the margin implications might be for such a solution? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Jess. Thank you. Thank you for your wishes. Regarding the cloud infrastructure, I think you bring up a very good point. All of the -- in particular, some of the major cloud titans, not all but certainly the major ones we're working with, all have international presence. And Arista has put in an infrastructure, Ita and Marc, I would say much of last year and this year, so we're pretty ready for this. We've been handling this for some time now. We're coming on 2 years, where we've been pretty prepared for this. Our top cloud titans tend to order at the point of location and that's something we're very comfortable with, and we have station depots and support capabilities everywhere. In fact, I would say to you, with the exception of maybe China, that we haven't seen that same type of cloud titans in other international locations, and we look to grow them more perhaps with service providers internationally who may become cloud providers as well. So we believe strongly that we have the infrastructure for it. Ita, do you want to add to the -- anything more to that? Ita Brennan : No, I think, clearly, we've been focused very much particularly, starting with Europe and then in APAC, in adding infrastructure in advance of growing the revenue. So I think we're well setup to be able to take any acceleration of business that comes from that. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, just to put this in perspective for you, Marc just shared some data with me. We're in 68 countries today with over 40 service depots, Jess, so... Jess Lubert : So...Did you see some of those rulings accelerating the activity over there? Jayshree Ullal : Do I see some of them accelerating and growing? To be honest, they don't give us the vision and longevity of that to tell you beyond a few quarters. So I can see it, but it's difficult to predict precisely till they tell me. Jess Lubert : And then on the DWDM line card for data center interconnect? Jayshree Ullal : Well, yes. So you did ask a question on a future product. We'll comment on it when we introduce it, how about that, Jess? Jess Lubert : Okay. Can we at least assume that the margins will be consistent with the corporate average if you do introduce something along those lines? Ita Brennan : Yes, I don't think we're ready to comment on that yet. Let's get some products out, and then we'll, obviously, update you on how it fits into the model. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jess. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rajesh Ghai of Macquarie. Rajesh Ghai : I wanted to rephrase a question that's been asked before on this call, and it's really to address a concern that I hear about cloud titans, some of them launching their own switches, their own white-box switches. So what percentage of the data center networking spend are the cloud titans that Arista typically target? In other words, how much of the spend requires a performance latency in Arista switches and how much of the spend could be targeted using white boxes? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Rajesh, that's a good question. I'll share with you some of the public data, and then, obviously, whatever is confidential, I can't. But if you look at some of the major cloud titans, like Google or Amazon as 2 examples, they have a precedence of building their own switches long before Arista was even founded or came into the picture. So even when cloud titans invest in their own switches, they complement these with Arista product for a very good reason. And generally, the good reason is they build their own to get economies of scale for single-use cases. But they use Arista's to get the programmability and scale out, particularly in the spine or spline categories. So we do complement each other, and we also have a habit of working with them on switches they have. We work very closely with FBOSS, and we intend to work fully closely with Microsoft ACS initiative or other cloud titans as they present themselves. So we don't look at them as threats. We look at them as opportunities to work with them to make them better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alyssa Johnson from Pacific Crest Securities. Alyssa Johnson : Can you remind me, was there a certain vertical that's kind of driving your expectations for strong Q4? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think Ita mentioned it, Alyssa, and that would be the cloud titans. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. George Notter : I wanted to go back to the international side of the business. I think if I look at the numbers in absolute terms, your international business has been pretty consistent for the last 3 or so quarters. I guess, I'm looking for more evidence of traction there. I'm wondering if you can give us the number of the VARs or distributors that you guys now are selling through internationally, the number of salespeople. Maybe if you exclude the cloud titans and you sort of normalize those international numbers, is the balance of the business growing? I guess, I'm just kind of looking for evidence of more and more progress? Jayshree Ullal : George, good question. So we have legal entities in 18 countries. We have VARs. Our VARs have increased from -- almost doubled to about 52 channel partners. And these are selected partners. We don't just go sign every Tom, Dick and Harry, right? And we do have presence in, as I've often shared with you, the developed countries. We haven't really put as much focus on the emerging countries. In the absence of cloud titans internationally, I think we're doing very well. We don't talk about breakdown in salespeople, but we are in 62 countries with the 60 plus channels partners we have. So this is also an important factor. But I can tell you, we're hiring disproportionately internationally from a sales point of view than we are in the U.S. relative to the contribution. So we are investing ahead of revenue internationally. And hopefully, those are good statistics for you to start to extrapolate. But I've said this before and I'll say it again, George, I think the success of U.S. is really hiding the success internationally. George Notter : Got it. Was the international business up sequentially ex the cloud titans? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Chuck Elliott : All right. This concludes the Arista Q3 2015 Earnings Call. I also want to mention that we have posted the presentation, which provides additional perspective on our Q3 2015 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website, as well as our General Counsel, Marc Taxay, mentioned, we will be posting shortly after the call a summary of the key dates in our legal proceedings. And finally, thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release, announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use in this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our 2015 and Q4 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a spectacular year with a strong finish. Annual revenue grew 43.4% year-over-year to a record $837.6 million while earnings per share increased 52.8% to $2.44. This was driven by our innovative platforms, differentiated EOS stack and CloudVision orchestration. Services contributed 11.1% of overall sales as cloud demand fueled our growth across our top verticals, especially the cloud titans. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 76.8% of total revenue in 2015 as our international theaters progressed steadily. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 65.3% for the year as we grew profitability in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. We are now in excess of 3,700 cumulative customers, including new customer upticks and expansion from our existing customer base. Microsoft was 12% of our 2015 revenue, symbolic of the continued shift we see from on-premise enterprise to workloads in the public cloud. We remain fully committed to significant R&D and customer support investments, often in conjunction with our key technology partners to bring open, industry-wide cloud conversions. Let me quickly recap some of our 2015 highlights. Early in the year, we announced 26 new leaf and spline [ph] platforms for 10, 25, 40, 50 and 100 gigabit ethernet, all based on our single binary image EOS philosophy, utilizing diverse silicon architectures. In May 2015, we achieved the coveted leaders quadrant with one other vendor in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for data center networking out of the 11 vendors mentioned. We forged a key agreement with HP for conversion for structure of compute and storage integrated by HP OneView and Arista EOS. We introduced a revolutionary platform, CloudVision, for workload provisioning and workflow automation, offering interoperability across overlays like VMware NSX as well as integration into Dell, HP and OpenStack frameworks. Later in the summer, we extended CloudVision to security with Macro-Segmentation Services, or MSS for short. Holistic security is a top-of-mind customer mandate, and we are working well with security visionaries like Palo Alto Networks, Check Point, F5, Fortinet and VMware to realize it.  In fall of 2015, we launched our media and entertainment initiative with industry leaders, transforming the once analog world to a highly digitized, software-defined and IP one. In November of last year, we delivered our first spine Internet booking solutions connecting between data centers with Layer 1, Layer 2 and Layer 3 options endorsed by our leading customers : Box, Equinox [ph] and Netflix. Earlier this year, in January of 2016, we announced a foundational Arista EOS infrastructure with NetDB, a network-wide, state-oriented database. NetDB builds upon our core state architecture by adding network-wide actions including state-sharing mechanisms for control, replication, rollback and streaming analytics. We also announced use cases for hybrid cloud, Docker container support and more programmability models with OpenConfig and Go. All of these are compelling examples and alternatives to the traditional world we all live in. Demonstrably, we have had a busy year, growing our employee strength to over 1,200 with worldwide investments across 70 countries and 120 support people. And as we enter the new 2016 fiscal year, we believe we are gaining market share and increased relevance in the cloud networking segment. We are the only authentic state-based cloud stack, differentiated from mega-scale networking. Others may mimic us with marketing, buzzwords and architectures. We simply execute and deliver. We believe our publish-subscribe-notify is simply several years ahead of the industry, and I couldn't be more proud of our customers' steadfast acceptance of Arista as well as our team's results.  Now I will turn it over to Ita for Q4 and 2015 financial details. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon.  [Audio Gap] legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits and the release of a tax gap reserve described in the prior quarter. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q4 were $254.4 million, up 41% year-over-year and above our guidance of $238 million to $242 million. Revenues for the year came in at $837.6 million, up 43% from the prior year. As anticipated, our cloud titan vertical demonstrated particular strength in the fourth quarter combined with solid contributions from the other key verticals. Service revenues continued to grow, reaching 11.5% of revenue for the quarter, up from 11.1% in Q3. International revenues came in at $47 million or 19% of total revenue, down from 22% last quarter. We experienced continued growth in EMEA, offset by some lumpiness in APAC. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 64%, in line with our guidance of 62% to 65% and reflecting an anticipated shift in revenue mix toward the cloud titans in the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $85.7 million, up from $83.1 million last quarter. Total spending grew 3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, considerably slower than our 13% topline growth. R&D spending decreased by $1.5 million, with lower-than-anticipated variable and prototype spending. Sales and marketing expense increased to 11.4% of revenue in the quarter, reflecting additional headcount and higher variable compensation expenses in the period. Our operating income for the quarter was $71.3 million or 29% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.9 million. And our effective tax rate was 18.5%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $57.5 million or 23.4%. This effective tax rate of 18.5% reflects the full benefit of the renewal of the research and development tax credit for 2015. Excluding this effect, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 30.4%, resulting in non-GAAP net income of $49.1 million or 20%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 72.1 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $0.80, up from $0.59 in the prior quarter and up 50% from the prior year. This earnings per share number includes a $0.12 benefit for the renewal of the research and development tax credit for 2015.  Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $9 million for the quarter, slightly below our outlook of $10 million from the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $687.3 million. We generated $117 million of cash from operations in the December quarter, up from $10.6 million in the prior period. DSOs came in at 54 days, down from 68 days in Q3 and 57 in Q2. We have made significant process improvements in this area during the quarter and are pleased to see this reflected in the reduced DSO metrics. Inventory turns were 3.2x, up from 2.6 in Q3. Inventory decreased to $92.1 million in the quarter, down from $110 million in the prior period. This reduction is the result of increased focus on inventory management and supply/demand planning over the last number of quarters. Our deferred revenue balance was $197 million, up from $191 million in Q3. This balance continues to be largely made up of short- and long-term service contracts with some product deferrals related to acceptance terms of future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 45 days, up from 38 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.3 million.  Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We are pleased with our 2015 financial performance, with revenues up 43% and earnings per share up 58% on a year-over-year basis.  As we look forward to 2016, we believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Workloads continue to march towards the cloud, benefiting our key customers, who continue to deploy our differentiated product set across their data centers. It is typical for Arista to see activity in the first quarter somewhat muted as customers complete their budgeting and planning processes. Based on our current visibility, we expect revenues for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $232 million to $240 million, representing a slight reduction from Q4 '15 levels but still showing growth on a year-over-year basis of 30% to 34%. Our revenue mix is expected to continue to be more heavily weighted towards our cloud titan customers. And on that basis, we expect gross margins in the 62% to 65% range. With this as backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with our ongoing lawsuits, is as follows : Revenues of approximately $232 million to $240 million, gross margin of approximately 62% to 65% and operating margins of approximately 26%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 28% to 30%, with diluted shares of approximately 72.5 million. Please note that based on our current understanding, we expect costs associated with the lawsuit to approximate $9 million for the quarter. With that, I will turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin : Jayshree, I wanted to start out with kind of the cloud vertical. Obviously, you had a strong showing here in Q4 with the cloud titans. You're guiding to another strong quarter in Q1. We've seen other companies on the enterprise side, specifically Cisco and NetApp, start to see a little slowdown in the enterprise side. So one, what's your view on the strength and the visibility and the continued strength in cloud this year? And could you offer any sort of visibility, what you're seeing on the enterprise side as well? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Brent. Well, I'm no macro economy expert, so I'll leave that to the pundits. But in our micro cloud world at Arista, we continue to see strength in the marketplace. Cloud titans had a strong quarter in Q4, and we expect to see that in Q1 and beyond as well. I'm especially encouraged by the rapid shift we are witnessing of enterprise workloads to private, public or hybrid cloud. So I think the cloud economy trend is pretty inevitable to me, and I see that in 2 forms. I see that as hybrid cloud implementations in the enterprise and, obviously, public cloud implementations, where Arista provides product today to our cloud titans. All 4 verticals did well, but clearly, the cloud titans did better. But I would say the other 3 were strong and grew well, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi. Stanley Kovler : I just wanted to ask specifically about Microsoft, if it managed to hit 10% of revenue for 2015. And if so, if the math is right, it was down a few million, in line with the guidance you gave heading into the year, flat to down at Microsoft. What's the outlook specifically for Microsoft for 2016? Should we expect it to be 10% or more of your revenue into 2016? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Stan. So just, first, a little quick review on history. Microsoft has always been our top customer with greater than 10% concentration. I believe in 2013, it was in the 20s. In 2014, it went down to the teens. And in 2015, we're now 12%. So as a percentage of total revenue, it's steadily going down. As actual numbers, it continues to be important and is actually steadily going flat to up. And we fully expect 2016 to be an important spend year for Microsoft. I think it'll continue the trend down in percentage but remain relevant in actual revenue contribution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Mark Moskowitz : Just wanted to get a sense here. Could you talk a little more about the cloud penetration with respect to the cloud titans in terms of not only the cloud providers but also those who are doing their own private or hybrid cloud on their own? If you could talk about how the penetration runway looks there. And then bigger picture, your numbers obviously speak to themselves in terms of the strength you're seeing, but investors are going to start thinking about what's next. And so how should investors start thinking about Arista in terms of moving into routing over the next few years? And what that revenue contribution could look like over time? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, yes. So thank you. I think, Mark, the way to think of this is our cloud penetration has still just begun. We may not be in the first innings, but we're definitely still only in the second or third innings. There's plenty here, right? Everybody's infrastructures just starting to build out. Most of them started in the last couple of years, so plenty of room for growth. At the same time, there's plenty of room for all of these cloud titans to experiment. We worked with Facebook and Wedge and OCP designs. We worked with Microsoft's open switch architecture. We have worked in the past with other cloud titans, who actually developed switches even before Arista was founded. So we believe these can mutually coexist, and the TAM is so large that you're always going to have a permutation and combination of leaves and spines. Arista's increasing focus will be to work more and more closely in building the world-class universal spine. And sometimes, we may work with Arista leaf. And other times, we may work with other leaves in the network. So we believe our penetration still has a lot of room for growth, and we can coexist very much with internal development. In terms of what's next for us, I think it's most important to know, our primary market is the data center, is the cloud. This is a tremendously large TAM, as you know. I think the total available market in 2015 is still in the $8 billion range. And here we are reporting $837 million, so lots of headroom there. Don't want anyone to forget it. And as for routing, routing is not new to us. We've been doing Layer 3 routing for some time. And we fully expect to build our BGP scale, our Internet cable routes and continue to penetrate -- we are very hopeful that the, how do I say this, the old core routing will become the new spine. And more of these functions will be naturally features on our spine. And I think that's a tremendous opportunity for service providers to consolidate their CapEx and for Arista to provide more OpEx savings as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven Milunovich : Do you have any comment on the case with Cisco? And specifically, since the ITC judge's initial determination came out just a few weeks ago, if the tone of conversation with your clients has changed at all? Are they at all more cautious? Jayshree Ullal : I'll take a bit of it, and then I'd love to have our expert and GC, Marc Taxay, my good friend, comment more. First of all, Arista is always happy to address specifics in the courtroom, not in sensational blog rooms. But having said that, our primary focus, as you rightly point out, Steve, has been our customers. And their support to us has been unwavering. Our goal has been to offer them appropriate design workarounds with nonintrusive upgrades, and they are very comfortable with our plans. And they are very supportive of what we are doing and how we are working with them. Marc, do you want to add some more? Marc Taxay : Sure, Jayshree. Just to briefly update everyone on the status of the investigation. As you point out, starting with the 944 investigation, the administrative law judge did an issue -- issued an initial determination in that case on February 2. As a reminder, that case originally had 6 patents in it, 1 was dropped, so there were 5 remaining. Of the 5 remaining patents, 3 of them, the judge found that we infringed and 2 he found that we did not. It's important to note that of the 3 patents that were in question, they actually relate to only 2 features. The first addresses the manner in which our agents communicate state to SysDB, and the second relates to our implementation of private VLANs. We've said this before, and we'll repeat it here, Cisco is not asserted, and the judge didn't find in this case, that EOS contains any Cisco code. It's also important to note that PVLANs is a common feature that's offered by nearly all network switch vendors today. Going forward, we're seeking commission review of the infringement findings in the initial determination. The ITC will consider our arguments as well as Cisco's and issue its final determination on June 2. If the ITC finds a violation and issues remedial orders, that then goes to the U.S. Trade representative, who will consider whether -- to veto those orders during the 60-day presidential review period. That period will end on August 2. We're going to continue to make our case to the ITC, of course. And as a mitigation strategy, we're also going to be in the process of developing technical workarounds for these patents, as Jayshree mentioned. We are very confident in those workarounds. And if the ITC does issue an exclusion order as part of this process, we'll seek to obtain customs' approval that the workarounds are outside the scope of the orders in order for us to continue the uninterrupted importation of products. This will be a time-critical exercise needing strong execution. Of course, Arista will respect the final determination of the ITC. If the final determination is adverse, we'll work in good faith to implement the workaround so that, to the best of our knowledge, all products supplied to customers will be non-infringing. Now with respect to the 945 investigation, that's still under review by the ALJ. The administrative law judge will issue her initial determination on April 26. That decision will then be subject to review by the commission, and we expect for them to issue a final determination and any remedial orders for that case on August 26. That then goes to the presidential review for the 945, and it would end on October 26. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Marc. I feel like I have a PhD in ICT. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Jayshree Ullal : Alex? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : I wanted to squeeze 2 in. Maybe just first you can comment on where you are in the development of the workaround and your confidence in your ability to get those built and approved by the end of Q2. And then for Ita, I was hoping to touch upon margins as expenses came in quite a bit lower than we expected, and you're guiding operating margins to higher levels than we've seen you guide for the last several quarters even though there hasn't really been a change to gross margin forecast. So I was just hoping to understand if you feel like 26% or better is likely to be a sustainable operating margin level going forward? If you think you can make all the needed investments to support your growth at those levels, or if we should expect operating margins to dip as we look out towards Q2 and the second half of 2016? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think if you look at the approximately 26% operating margin guidance, it's pretty consistent with last quarter as well, right? And I think the way to think about that is as we ramp spending and make the investments that we need to make, we're doing everything that we need to do from an investment perspective. But revenues are growing at a pretty fair clip, right? And we're being very judicious in how we spend money. And sometimes, the revenue is going to grow faster, right. And that will result in some upside to that. I think our guidance takes a view of, here are the possible things that we need to go do in the quarter, and that's kind of reflected in that 26%. I think in terms of a long-term model, we've talked about maybe a 25% operating margin being a reasonable way to think about, and that gives us scope to grow sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue a little bit and maintain our investments in R&D. So I think that's how to think about it. I don't know if the 26% is anything new necessarily. And probably, long term, it's like a 25% operating margin model. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jess. No, I think we have been planning and working on what-if scenarios and cases. While we don't believe we infringed these patents, you always have to plan. And we have been planning over the last year. Our engineers have been hard at work. So we feel very comfortable that in the case of 944 that the majority of the workarounds will be available -- are being worked around right now and will be available in Q2. Marc, do you want to add anything more to that? Marc Taxay : Yes, I think that's right. I mean our team has been hard at work. We're continuing to evaluate everything, of course. And we're in the process of issuing out a new -- releasing out a new version of the software, which will come out in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Ryan Hutchinson : So 2 quick questions here, just to round out that conversation on the legal. Ita, did you factor any -- did you change the methodology as it relates to guidance to factor any sort of disruption as it relates to legal? So that's more of a clarification. And then the question really is on another one of your top cloud titan customers, Facebook. They've been pretty vocal about their intentions to build out EU2 with -- 100% powered by Open Compute. What role, if any, will Arista play? And more broadly, how does the relationship potentially change over the course of time? Ita Brennan : I'll take the first part of that question. The guidance for Q1 is business as normal, right, with support of our customers and not really assuming any disruption from a legal perspective. Jayshree Ullal : That's correct. That's exactly right. And your second question on Facebook, Ryan, we have said a number of times, we fully expect our cloud titans to also do engineering. It's not the sole responsibility of Arista. But in many cases, this is codevelopment. And in many cases, it's complementary. So I do think Facebook will use a lot of their capabilities. But it's core versus context. It's clearly core to Arista, and we provide a lot of capability. And then we work closely with Facebook's application to give them the right control, so I'm very comfortable that there's room and opportunity for both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel. Sanjiv Wadhwani : I'm going to try to sneak in 2. The first question, Jayshree, on Tomahawk-enabled switches, just curious to see if those are ramping in line or better or maybe even worse than expectations? And then the second question is really on the legal side. Any update on the antitrust claim that you filed against Cisco? And do you see that impacting the ITC or the District Court lawsuits in any shape or form? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So I'm looking at the Tomahawk data. Good acceptance of the products in general, especially the cloud titans tend to be the earliest adopters of this type of technology. I would say this is a key year for Tomahawk, meaning good acceptance of 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig. We still haven't seen 25 and 50 really take off the way we'd want to. So lot's been written about it last year. But I think the year of 25 and 50 gig will really be this year, and so that's critical. Regarding the lawsuit, once again, I'm going to let Marc talk about this. The only comment I want to make is we are -- when a monopolist asserts ownership of open standards, I believe it not only harms Arista but it harms an entire ecosystem and brings innovation to a standstill. So we really want to innovate. We don't want to litigate. We thought long and hard about this. And Marc, maybe you want to comment on why we did it. Marc Taxay : Sure. No, I think that's right. And I think we evaluated the situation, and we felt that based upon what we had seen that Cisco was engaging in a series of anti-competitive behaviors. And we initiated the action really to level the playing field so we can win in the marketplace based on the merits of our products. So we did initiate this filing. We filed, in the copyright case, in the district court a motion for a leave to amend our answer to the complaint that was originally filed to include the 2 counterclaims. The first claim alleges that Cisco is engaged in an illegal bait-and-switch with the industry and its customers to protect its monopoly position in switching and routing. We asserted in that, that Cisco has aggressively promoted its CLI as the industry standard to encourage customers to adopt and heavily invest in the CLI without having to worry about vendor lock-in or having to invest in training and scripting for alternative CLI commands. Our claims allege that when Arista achieved success in the marketplace that threatened Cisco's position, Cisco reversed course and now essentially is using those customers' investments against them to achieve vendor lock-in and protect its dominant market share by seeking to preclude competitors from using its industry-standard CLI commands, contrary to its past representations. The second claim alleges that Cisco uses its market position in switching to punish its customers for buying competing products by prohibitively increasing the prices it charges for servicing Cisco switches where the customer has indicated they plan to buy switches from Cisco's competitors. So what we've done is we filed the amended complaint. That's being evaluated by the court now. The court will make a decision as to whether or not we can include this as part of the existing action or whether or not we should be filing a separate action. We'll find out on that shortly. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Marc. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Sterne CRT. David Kurtz : Marc, we're going to keep going at this. In your prepared remarks, there were a couple of really important sentences that I heard about the timing of the workaround, and it sounded like there was some request for an exclusion of the workarounds and -- as far as how the products could be continued to be delivered to customers until the workarounds were assessed by the court, something along those lines. Could you clarify that and maybe go through that again and what that means for revenue as we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4? Jayshree Ullal : I don't think we mentioned anything on our prepared remarks. Can you clarify what you're asking? David Kurtz : Yes, Marc went into some detail in his prepared remarks, Jayshree, about the process of the workarounds as they go through the court. And I just wanted him to expand on that a little bit as far as the timing and what the gates you had to go through to get that approved. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Marc Taxay : Sure. So as we said, we have been developing design arounds. And we're in the process of releasing a new version of EOS that will include that. The process for us would include seeking approval from customs in order for customs to ensure that we can import those products into the U.S., a non-infringing version of those products into the U.S. And so we'll initiate that process once the final determination from the ITC comes in. It's our view, of course, now we're still fighting this case. We're going to continue to fight it, and we've submitted our briefs over to the full commission. And then once the commission, if the commission issues an adverse ruling, at that stage will work with customs to try to go through the process as quickly as possible. Jayshree Ullal : So just to be clear, we won't know anything about this until June 2, as Marc said. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rajesh Ghai with Macquarie. Rajesh Ghai : I had a question for Ita and one for Jayshree. Ita, can you talk about the deferred revenue? The number did not go up as fast this quarter. And the question for Jayshree is that the software-only SKU has been out for some time now. Can you talk about the -- what are you seeing in terms of demand for that software-only SKU? Are you seeing any increase in interest from the cloud titans or the web [indiscernible]  Customers? Ita Brennan : Yes, so just to take the deferred revenue question. I mean, the deferred revenue balance is going to move around quarter-over-quarter, right? The -- our service renewals are for different time periods, large customers, smaller customers and so on. And then even on the product side, it's all about the timing of shipments, right? So if we're shipping stuff at the end of the quarter to a certain customer, then it's going to be higher. If we ship it the first day of the following quarter, it will be lower. So it's not a metric that you're going to see follow the traditional -- what you would typically see as a very predictable cycle through the... Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think it's also fair to say, it could stay flat, it can go down, it can go up. I wouldn't read too much into that metric. It's not [indiscernible] customer. And Rajesh, regarding your question on software SKUs, we've offered that a lot and talked about it a lot. But at the end of the day, we've seen that more of our customers want to know we have it but prefer to use our hardware and software together. So the actual success and implementation and deployment of this has been small. The discussion of it has been large. There is a disproportionate difference between implementation and discussion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Just a question, talking about geographies, et cetera. You mentioned that Asia saw some lumpiness. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how we should expect that and those other international geographies to develop? And I guess I'm looking at it in the context of the feedback that we have received from a lot of channel in international is that it seems like Arista is having a hard time completely satisfying the demand in some of those newer geographies. So can you just talk about how we should expect these international geographies to develop? And what your sense is as to underlying demand trends, et cetera? Jayshree Ullal : First of all, James, I think we're doing very well internationally, but it's hidden by the fact that we're doing very well in the United States. So I want to make that point. I'm especially encouraged by our success in Europe. We just brought in a very strong leader with 25, 30 years' experience in networking. And we're doing very strong in the especially developed countries : Nordics, Netherlands, Germany and U.K. In Asia, what happens is Asia is not one country. It's really Australia, Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, including India, where our greatest focus is. So first of all, we don't -- we are reasonably low in China. And so our numbers kind of tend to jump around quarter-by-quarter, depending on the deal size and what we win. So we had some fairly large customer wins in Q2 and Q3 than we did in Q4. In terms of the difficulty we are having, I think we're still in the very early stages. I don't see difficulty. I just say we started later. So our real first year of international focus, I would say, is 2015. And I'm fully expecting to see more -- and one of the great statistics for me of success in end market is new customers. We are seeing more new customer acceptance in international than we even are in the United States, which, to me, suggests that the next few years will be very promising internationally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : Jayshree, can you just clarify the comments you made around the Tomahawk-linked products, how are you expecting them to ramp the success of [indiscernible], you kind of cut out when you were -- at least on my side -- when you were responding there. That's my first clarification. The second was just in terms of verticals. If I think about financials, big 7 cloud -- well, big cloud titans, other service providers, media -- I don't know how you want to split the verticals now versus previous -- how you previously talked about it. But is it still quite balanced when you look at the 2015 numbers for revenue? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think I understood your Tomahawk question, but I'll try again. And Kulbinder, hopefully, if I don't answer it, we'll chat more on the call back. But we are pleased with the transition on Tomahawk. We have not seen it become mainstream yet. Trident is still the main technology, Trident I, Trident II, et cetera. And you have to understand, we've really only had 1 quarter of Tomahawk. We introduced the products, but the actual qualification and production and installation has been 1 quarter. So I see this year as the real indicator. And the other reason I think we haven't seen an immediate pickup is customers are happy with our 10, 40, 100 gig current offerings. They're meeting their features. They're meeting their price points. So the reason to switch to Tomahawk would be specifically more need for 25 and 50 gig, which requires more of an ecosystem : you need the host adapters, you need the NICs, you need the compute, you need the storage, you need everyone to come together. So this would be a more crucial year for Tomahawk than last year was. And your second question was on -- I mean... Kulbinder Garcha : Revenue breakdown vertical for 2015. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so verticals haven't changed. We continue to enforce our top 4 verticals. What I can tell you, looking at our 2015 order or priority or success of the verticals, if you will, is number one, was clearly cloud titans. We -- number 2 was service providers and Tier 2 cloud providers. And financial services and high-tech enterprise were tied for third place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Erik Suppiger : I wanted to just get a sense for your plans on growing the sales organization. Where are you in terms of sales force expansion at this point? Jayshree Ullal : We're doing well. We could always be doing better. I think one of our sales models, if you look at it, which is different from others is Mark Smith and Anshul and Mark Foss, they're not focused on coverage. They are focused on our 4 verticals and what we call the Arista 100. We are looking to make an engagement that's both long-term and impactful and strategic, where they really want to transform the data center. So if it's a regular enterprise IT customer, they're probably less interested in Arista. Because they'll just keep buying what they are, and it will be hard to change old habits. And so our sales model is very much targeted on : Go deep rather than go wide, and really focus in a few good geographies and obviously the top 4 verticals than everywhere. And we are doing very well there. We've hired well both in sales and technical SEs [ph]. Erik Suppiger : Can you give us a breakout on the -- on your -- on the size of the sales organization? Jayshree Ullal : I don't think we've done that historically. But if I look from year-over-year, we've definitely increased by double-digit percentages. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Jeffrey Kvaal : I have a question, a return to a theme that you just hit upon, Jayshree, which is new customers. Can you help us maybe think through how much of your business each quarter or each year is driven by repeat orders and how much by new customers? And then the second part of that is, are there particular new customers or suites of larger new customers that you are excited about for 2016? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, those are both very good questions, Jeff. I -- new customers is something I personally measure a lot, not because they're the biggest contributor to core [ph] quarterly revenue, but it's basically a definition of seeds you sow for the future, right? In terms of actual contribution of revenue, they tend to be, I don't know, single, double-digit percentages. They're not big. And the reason I say that is because the new customer orders aren't big. To understand that, if you look at a typical Arista sales cycle, our first order is a SDN starter kit or a particular project that could be 50K or 100K. So even if we have lots of new customers, that doesn't add up to a lot of millions of revenue. But what you have to look at is not what the first customer is, but what happens 6 to 12 months and 18 months later. That's when we really get them to be -- and this is addressing your second question, you get them to be a relevant, big, million or multimillion dollar customer. So that's the pattern we see. We see a new logo and a small project, if you will. And then within 12 to 18 months, a more substantial win. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex Henderson : So I've got 2 questions. They're both on the kind of on the chip side of things. First off, has there been some delay in the timing of getting the Broadwell chip out from Intel? And has that slipped your time line for the full architecture of 25 gig stack rolling out a little bit in terms of timing into the back half? And then the second one, along the same lines, can you give us an update on what you're thinking on the Jericho product coming out and when that might impact the router market? I mean, that's an $8.6 billion TAM that will roll into the switch market at some point when that gets going. Just give us an update on those 2? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, thanks, Alex. They're both good questions. I think you're absolutely right to point out that the 25 and 50 gig NIC, and it's not just Intel, it's Intel, Broadcom. I think Mellanox plays in that. And there's a lot of onboard LAN on motherboard-type activity. All of that has not happened in 2015, and we fully expect them to happen in 2016. And I think one of the biggest drivers will actually be storage. As you move to more scale-out, flash-based storage, there will be less and less fiber channel SANs and more and more Tier 2 IP storage SANs. And we think 25 and 50 gig is a pivotal performance to hit, while 1 and 10 gig may be more for compute. So you're right to point out that, that hasn't happened as fully and well and will in 2016. In terms of Jericho, the one thing I would just say in general about the silicon industry, since I came from this industry 30 years ago, is we always tend to overestimate the availability of a chip as opposed to the availability of a system. I think Jericho was announced by Broadcom a year ago, and we are very impressed with the table sizes and capacity and buffering and capability. But announcing a chip is very different than vendors announcing systems. I fully expect that systems will come into play in the summer of '16. And the qualification of those systems, because it's routing and spine, can take longer. So I think 2016 will be a year of trials for Jericho and core routing. And then the multibillion-dollar market you talk about will really be a multiyear execution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Hendi Susanto : First for Jayshree, what is your grand vision on Arista products and solution in the security space after the new release of the CloudVision? And second question will be for Ita, how much CapEx should we expect in 2016? Jayshree Ullal : I'll take the first question, Ita, and then -- so security is definitely a top-of-mind initiative for a lot of our customers, both in the cloud and in the standard enterprise network. Arista does not fancy ourselves as a security expert. We think that's a market in itself, and it just changes every time there's a new threat vector. And so what we want to do is work with the industry-leading pioneers and visionaries there. One of our closest partners is Palo Alto Networks. We are also working with Check Point and F5, Fortinet, VMware. And what we see is it's one thing to actually say, I detect a threat, which our security partners do. It's another thing to say, I avoid permeating a threat. And this is really where Arista comes in. With CloudVision, what we're doing is truly establishing how you can maintain firewalls and rules and policies with our security partners, but really map this from physical to virtual to advanced telemetry and orchestrate through the entire way so that you're not just catching one silo threat but making sure you can mitigate this across an entire network. So if you will -- somebody catches the disease, and we make sure it doesn't spread. Ita Brennan : And then just on the CapEx, I mean we've been averaging about $5 million a quarter. Could you see that spike a little bit a couple million here and there if we add some capacity and stuff? Maybe. But it should stay roughly in that range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have a question on the 100 gig market. Is there any delay to the deployment of 100 gig because of the 25, 50 gig issues you discussed here? I understand that the technology also reduces the price for 100 gig. And the question is, if we should model slower ramp for 100 G as a result of what you're discussing? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tal. No, I don't think so. I think the fueling of the 100 gig, especially in the spine, is driven by aggregate of 10 gig, 40 gig today, and will only get more as 25 and 50. So what we see in our customer base is everybody is preparing for 100 gig spine, independent of whether their leaves are 40 or 50 or 25 or 10. And the real -- obviously, 100 gig in ports is much more smaller than 40 or 10 or 1 right now. But the real issue for 100 gig for us to solve and the industry to solve is making sure we can deliver incredible scale capacity density but also at the right price point, particularly on the optic side. So I think the embedded optics and the cost of that is a bigger issue than the 25 and 50 gig. Tal Liani : Is your comment on margins -- if I rewind back a few quarters ago, you guided that gross margin will decline almost every quarter. I think you even said 100 basis points every quarter for 4 quarters or something. And now we're seeing better margins. So is your comment on margins related to the delay or to the slow ramp of 25 and 50G? Jayshree Ullal : No, not at all. I would say, Tal, that our margins, we did drop to 64% in Q4. And it's much more tied to mix, customer mix and product mix. But we feel pretty good about the acceptance of both 40 gig and 100 gig last year, and we feel quite optimistic on the additional acceptance of all this, this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra with Buckingham Research. Rohit Chopra : A couple of quick questions. Just, Jayshree, on the competitive front, have been there any changes in the posture of incumbents as they continue to experience share losses? And then secondarily, have buyers changed any of their buying patterns? Are there larger or smaller deals as we sort of close the quarter, are sales cycles any longer? Have you seen any changes on the buyer front? Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question. Have there been any aggressive competitive changes? I think it's the same as always. We -- when it comes to Arista, we do see that we receive our lion's share or fair share of aggressive competition, and so it continues to be heightened. But I wouldn't say there's any change. I would say it's always been heightened, and it continues to be so. Have we seen any shift in behavior? Not yet, no. We are seeing strength in the cloud. We're not the expert on enterprise, but the enterprises we serve tend to be extremely knowledgeable and capable and maybe, therefore, are a smaller percentage of the broad enterprise market. But in our world, in our micro Arista world, we haven't seen any dramatic changes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Jayshree, Ita, my question is around the weakness we and others are noting in enterprise IT spending in particular. So this a bigger-picture question, which is, would you anticipate the big banks, the high-tech customers you sell into, asking for hyperscale price points that currently a Google or an Amazon would demand from their vendors? And if so, how would you manage margins in this more compressed ASP scenario, where enterprises are asking for hyperscale price points? Jayshree Ullal : Vijay, yes, that's a great question. And my answer to pricing is always the same, whether it's a customer or you, which is if you show me the volume, I'll show you the pricing. So if we have large enterprise customers who can drive hyperscale volume, we'd love to achieve those price points. Because it gives us a chance to drive cost reductions and, therefore, price reductions. And so there are some enterprises who can do that, and there are many who can't. So I think it depends on the sector. Ita, do you want to add anything more to that? Ita Brennan : Yes. No, I think that's exactly it, right? I mean it's very much a volume-based pricing model for us, right? So yes, if there's volume there, we can drive the pricing and the cost [ph]. Vijay Bhagavath : Excellent. And a quick follow-up, if I may, which is -- don't want to beat down the Tomahawk thread here. But my question is really around, should we view 100 gig Tomahawk switching as really a second-half-weighted opportunity, because some of the checks we've been getting is mostly early volume, small volume, top-of-rack upgrades going all at some web scale data centers? The spine 100 gig refresh is really back half. How should we think about a second-half-weighted versus kind of an equal weight of a 100 gig Tomahawk refresh? Jayshree Ullal : I think your thought process on this is very good, Vijay. I think the only thing I'd add to what you just said, and I agree with it, is I think the first half will be heavily weighted to planning 100 gig spine and also deploying as many leaves, whether they're 10, 40, 25, 50. People don't think as hard about the deployment of leaves because they view them as disposable items. They have shorter depreciation cycles. And so I see that the 100 gig spine has definitely started already and will continue to increase in the summer and second half. But I don't necessarily see that as Tomahawk, I also see that as spines based on our Arad technology, leading to Jericho in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : First, a quick clarification if I might. The R&D -- pro-forma R&D in December was a little bit lower than what we were modeling in the prior quarter. Just want to find out if there was anything kind of onetime or timing nature that may be showing up in the March quarter, how to think about R&D. And then the question I wanted to get an update on is, any kind of quantification we can get to help assess progress on your partnerships? You talked today reminding us on the converged partnership with HP. And in the past, you've talked about VMware. I'd like to try to get some way we can assess progress or maybe outlook on partnerships. Ita Brennan : Yes, just to take the R&D question, I mean that does move around a little bit just based on variable spending, prototypes, NRE, that type of stuff, right? So there's nothing unusual happening there, just really timing of those 2 activities. Jayshree Ullal : And Simon, this is a question I'd like to answer better in forthcoming quarters. I believe HP, VMware and Palo Alto Networks and also the Docker container partnership we announced are all examples today of really technology marketing and how we work to sell together and, if you will, move from old-school networking to new converged or cloud networking. We haven't done a good job, and I think we owe that to you all, on successes and metrics we've had there. Because I think we've been more in the business development and marketing phase. We want customers to get that, clearly. I've been -- we've -- I'm particularly pleased with the successful combination we're seeing of NSX and Arista. We're seeing more of that now than we did, say, a year ago. But let's say let's take a rain check on that question when I can give you more concrete answers. Simon Leopold : Okay. You know I'll hold you to it, too. Jayshree Ullal : I know. I'm afraid of that. I owe you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, I have 2 or 3 related questions. They're truly related. First off, I know you are reluctant to give -- or let's just say you're not giving a more precise breakout in terms of the cloud titans versus the other verticals. But given your business model and how important the issue is from all perspectives, I'm hoping that you will give more granularity rather than that they're your largest switches, say [ph]. Can you at least tell us -- if you're not wanting to give us the exact number, can you at least tell us, are they closer to 50% of revenue than 1/3 of revenue? Jayshree Ullal : None of our 4 verticals, Paul, are anywhere close to 50% of our revenue. They average in the teens to the 25%. That's the averages. Paul Silverstein : So you're -- all right. Well, the... Jayshree Ullal : I answered your question. Paul Silverstein : You can't -- you -- obviously, you have to have a vertical that's greater than 25%, right? Unless they're all 25%? Jayshree Ullal : No, you can -- that's not always true. You can have one of them peak over 25% in a given quarter. But over a year -- and I want to be clear when I say that, just because we have 4 verticals doesn't mean we don't have anything beyond the 4 verticals either, right, so... Paul Silverstein : Well, I'm clearly talking in the context of where you guys break out revenue when you're talking of 4 verticals in that context. Jayshree Ullal : I think I've done my best to help you out by saying while we do not want to get in the practice of breaking verticals out, none of them or any of them are anywhere close to approaching 50%. Paul Silverstein : All right. I appreciate that. You're telling us cloud at most is 25% or thereabouts. All right. Let me move on. I'm not sure if you've done it recently, but you used to tell us your 10 largest customers on an annual basis back in '13, if I have the numbers correct, it was 43%. Can you give us an update on that? And then I've got a pricing question. Jayshree Ullal : No. I think the only 10% concentration customer we reported in '14 and... Paul Silverstein : I'm not asking the 10% customers. I'm not asking the 10% customers. I'm asking what are your 10 largest customers and the percentage of total revenue. Jayshree Ullal : Oh, I see. Ita, do you want to take that one? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think what I would say is it has been pretty stable, actually, right? It has been -- it is a significant part of the business, right? There's no doubt. I don't know if we've given the exact percentage, but it is a significant part of the business, right? And it has been pretty stable, if I look at it over the last 2, 3 years, it has been... Jayshree Ullal : It hasn't changed. Ita Brennan : It has not changed as a percentage of the business. The players inside that top 10 move around, and then the ranking moves around. But the actual percentage has been pretty consistent. Paul Silverstein : All right. One last question on pricing. I may have these numbers wrong. I apologize if I do. But I think I recall per port pricing declined for you by 15% in '14 and 10% in '13. Can you give us an update on that for '15, what average port pricing does... Jayshree Ullal : We'll take this question offline. I think we don't have that level of detail on past years versus now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I guess I wanted to go back to the international business. If I look at it in absolute dollar terms, I think it's been roughly flat for about 3 quarters. And obviously, it's a big percentage of the addressable market. Can you just kind of walk through what you're doing sales and marketing-wise to kind of get that business growing again? And is there some intuitive reason why it has been flat these last couple of quarters despite the larger business really growing? Ita Brennan : I think just to clarify the numbers, George, I think EMEA has actually been growing quite healthily for us, and it has been keeping pace actually with the overall business. APAC, I think, to Jayshree's point, it's still at the stage where if we win a big opportunity in a particular country, it's going to change that dynamic a lot, right? So I think about it in 2 phases. EMEA is more developed, and it's more consistent. And we are seeing success there. And then APAC is still a little bit more opportunistic, and we've got more work to do there. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I think it was well said, Ita. I think we've got a lot more volatility in APAC, and we've got more work to do there. In EMEA, I think our numbers have been steadily growing. Sometimes our numbers look higher if the placement of our cloud titans is in a particular geography in Europe, which is not really organic growth, but it reflects in our numbers. But I think in general, U.S. and EMEA have been growing, and APAC has been volatile and lumpy. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : I wanted to follow-up on the earlier discussions around Facebook and Microsoft, recognizing that there are some internal projects, but that you're still going to continue to sell to them. In aggregate, would you expect your business with them to be up or down this year to the extent you have visibility? And then related to that, would you expect any other customers outside of Microsoft to cross the 10% mark this year? Jayshree Ullal : Simona, I'll take your first question, which is, no, I don't expect any customer to top 10% this year, but I expect them all to be big customers. Specific to Facebook and Microsoft, your question was... Simona Jankowski : Up or down this year? Jayshree Ullal : It's too early to call. We don't get that kind of visibility for the entire year. Generally, as I've told you, our visibility is greater in 1 or 2 quarters than the entire year. And we feel good about the 1 or 2 quarters. Chuck Elliott : This concludes the Arista Q4 2015 Earnings Call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation which provides additional perspective on our 2015 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott - Director, Product and Investor Advocacy : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2016. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had another good quarter. Our revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $242.2 million, while earnings per share was $0.68. This was driven by our new innovative platforms and differentiated EOS stack. Services contributed 12.3% of our overall sales as cloud demand fueled our growth across our top verticals, especially the cloud titans. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 76% of our total revenue, while our international theaters progressed steadily in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.4% as we grew profitably in a highly-competitive and dynamic industry. We now have in excess of 3,850 cumulative customers, and we have increased our market share in 2015 for our relevant 10-gigabit, 40-gigabit, 100-gigabit Ethernet TAM to 12% in ports and 10% in revenue according to Cleveland Research. This quarter, we unveiled the next generation of the Universal Spine with its many roles with the Arista 7500R Series. Defying the traditional definitions of router and switch functions, the flagship 7500R blends the best of both with uncompromised Cloud Scale performance. Arista has been a longstanding pioneer of Spines since 2010 with deep and proven experience. The 7500R is inherently designed for investment protection across generations, a really rare feat in our industry. It is also our industry's first 100-terabit Spine. Combined with our innovative FlexRoute support for multiple routing protocols and rapid re-convergence of Internet tables, it supersedes prior notions of siloed places in the network for data center and core. By subsuming traditional router functions into the Spine, we are expanding our adjacency into the core and WAN router markets. In Q1 2016, we demonstrated many technology partnerships as well, including the integration with Checkpoint at RSA 2016, and with Palo Alto Networks at the Ignite User conference. Both are joint solutions for inserting security services into data center traffic flows using Arista's Macro Segmentation Services or MSS for short. Today, I would like to share a wild card topic with you on our Cloud Networking Strategy. It is clear to me, and us that the industry is changing with demand for more dynamic control for specific cloud-native applications. Rather than endure the perils of high operational cost of a monolithic closed OS, Arista recognized this trend very early on, and required an open, standards-based programmable network stack, which we pioneered as Arista EOS. We delivered differentiated attributes on it such as self-healing, high-availability, resiliency, a centralized network state database, modern scripting, granular programming and open APIs for interoperability. Our product and technology strategy is resonating and is symbolic of the continued shift from Enterprise IT to cloud workload. To cope with this inevitable shift, should networking move to a more component-based approach or continue as a network stack? The answer and the choice depends on the type of customer, and I want to reiterate that Arista is committed to different consumption models for the cloud. No one size fits all. We expect three delivery models for Cloud Networking as we enter into mainstream. One, Cloud-Class; here, the customers prefer best-of-breed systems like our Arista 7000 Series Leaf and Spine technology with our EOS brand of quality, high availability, extensibility across our top verticals. Two, Cloud Scale, cloud titans with engineering prowess demand hyperscale, and their desire for customization and control of their application environment means they sometimes need building blocks in their Leaf. Examples of this include Facebook's Wedge, Microsoft's SONiC or Google's focus on OpenConfig, used in conjunction with Arista's Spines of client (06:52) technology. Three, Cloud Converged Network. The more IT-based enterprises are seeking converged networks, and this convergence may be compute, storage, virtualization, containers or security. In conjunction with our technology partners, Arista seeks to leverage turnkey solutions, such as CloudVision. A good example is the open stack-based announcements in May of a converged system based on Arista Networking, Mirantis and Supermicro Systems, announced last month. Arista will vigorously pursue all three segments to address our Cloud Everywhere opportunity ahead of us. As we move into the second half of 2016, Arista is planning the addition of another strategic contract manufacturing partner. We have initiated the investment and local inventory hubs to support our increasing scale of operation. We believe, taking a page from the Tesla factories, that we can create a world-class automated manufacturing operation, and in doing so, bring more workforce to America. Naturally, we will incur some near-term costs and overhead to bring that kind of sustainable capacity and flexibility for our large customers. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita, our CFO, for our Q1 2016 financial detail. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 2016 results and our guidance for Q2 2016 is based on non-GAAP, and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q1 were $242.2 million, up 35% year-over-year, and above our guidance of $232 million to $240 million. Our cloud titan vertical demonstrated continued strength in the first quarter, combined with solid contributions from the other verticals. Service revenues continued to grow, reaching 12.3% of revenue for the quarter, up from 11.5% in Q4. International revenues came in at $59 million, or 24% of total revenue, up from 19% last quarter. While we continue to focus on expanding our international footprint, you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployment. Overall, gross margin in Q1 was 64.4%, slightly favorable to last quarter, and to our guidance of 62% to 65%, and reflecting the revenue mix in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $85.8 million, flat to last quarter. R&D spending was 22.7% of revenue, up from last quarter, reflecting growth in headcounts and continued prototypes and NRE investments. Sales and marketing expense was 9.9%, down from 11.4% last quarter, reflecting reduced variable compensation, offset by increased head count. Our operating income for the quarter was $70.1 million, or 29% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.4 million and our effective tax rate was 29.6%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $49.1 million, or 20.3%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 72.2 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $0.68, up 36% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $7.1 million for the quarter, below our outlook of $9 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $762.3 million. We generated $71 million of cash from operations in the March quarter. DSOs came in at 51 days, down from 54 days in Q4. We are pleased to see continued progress in this area during the quarter. Inventory turns were 3.6 times, up from 3.2 times in Q4. Inventory decreased to $84 million in the quarter, down from $92.1 million in the prior period. This reduction is the result of an ongoing focus on inventory management and supply planning. Our deferred revenue balance was $219.2 million, up from $197 million in Q4. The balance continues to be largely made up of short and long-term service contracts with some product deferrals related to acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 26 days, down from 45 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million with some incremental investments in R&D and operations. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, with revenues and earnings per share up more than 35% on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, we are excited about the fundamentals of the business and are seeing strong adoption of our new products across our verticals. As Jayshree outlined in her remarks, we plan to add an additional contract manufacturer, beginning in Q2 2016. In terms of what this means for the financials, you should expect to see us increase inventory by approximately $50 million to $100 million as we ramp new products and build out this additional manufacturing capacity. Turning to gross margin, our current view is that, while we may see some resulting increase in costs, all other things being equal, gross margin should remain within our previously stated long-term outlook of 60% to 65%. We may also incur incremental capital expenditures in the range of $5 million to $10 million in relation to this project. Now, turning to our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits; revenues of approximately $259 million to $265 million, gross margin of approximately 62% to 65%, and operating margin of approximately 26%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 27% to 29%, with diluted shares of approximately $72.5 million. Please note, that based on our current understanding, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $8 million for the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott - Director, Product and Investor Advocacy : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question due to time constraints. Thanks, all. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you for the question. Just some clarifications, Jayshree, you mentioned again that the cloud titans were strong this quarter. Are we getting to the point now, whereby that vertical is disproportionately higher than the other three that you typically talk about? Or is it still quite balanced? And was there any specific \u2013 more than 10% customer concentration this quarter? And then for, Ita, just on the gross margin pressure that you might see from the new contract volume dynamics, is that just a one-quarter phenomena or could it last for a few quarters? Many thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kulbinder. I think, the full vertical balance continues, although very much like Q4, Q1 had a strong contribution from cloud titans. And as long as you see a strong contribution from cloud titans, the gross margins tend to be lower. So if you recall, we saw 64% in Q4, and we're continuing to see around 64%. And I would go as far as to say, perhaps 64% is becoming closer to our reality on a per-quarter basis, with the possibility of it going to 62% and 63%, as well. And that is a, reflection not just of the cloud titan mix, but any volume-driven customer in any of the verticals. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I wouldn't say there's dramatic changes, but there's certainly a strong acceptance of key cloud titan customers who are increasing their spend in general in the cloud, and therefore with Arista. In terms of 10% concentration, we do not talk about this on a quarterly basis, but we'll certainly share this to you at the end of the year. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I guess, I just wanted to ask on \u2013 we hear a lot about internal development efforts at cloud titans, and I just wanted to get your color, Jayshree, on what you feel like the objectives generally are of those cloud titans on those internal development efforts and what their resources look like. But perhaps even more importantly, you also often talk about working with those customers to support their efforts. Can you give us some color on what you're doing to support those efforts? And how does that support benefit you in the long run? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Certainly. Thanks, James. We view these internal developments as important elements of application control for our cloud titans, and because we have such an open programmable EOS, we definitely view them not as a threat, but as an opportunity. And what I mean by that is, if you look at \u2013 let's take three examples of these that I tried to highlight earlier in my opening comments. We worked very closely with Facebook and Wedge and FBOSS to make sure that some of their user feed, cloud native applications could work better, and it's one use case in the least. Another example is our contribution of our drivers to SONiC; that was announced as part of OCP. A third example is the work that Google and AT&T and many companies are doing on OpenConfig in developing higher levels of abstraction. Arista is closely working on elements of EOS and tying that with these initiatives. So in that case, as I explained earlier, these end up being important building blocks, and typically, these are investments that the titans make that are not hundreds of thousands of engineers, but maybe tens of engineers. And so what we do and they do together is more tightly coupled and better together than each one alone. So from our perspective, there's always an important control of element for our cloud titans with the tremendous scale they have that we must help them with, and we look at this as joint development and joint solutions. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much. I would like to follow-up on this interesting new wrinkle, which is the factory build. Could you take us through the thought process behind that a little bit? And could you help us understand, is this a new factory that's going to support one customer in particular? It sounded like that might be a possibility. Or is this something that is going to support all of your customers? That would be helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Sure. Absolutely. So first of all, as you've noticed, Jeff, we have a very large percentage of our large customers in the U.S. So this is intended to support all of our customers, and in particular, our large customers. So one of the things we do consistently is expand the scale of our contract manufacturers. We already have a couple of them, and now we're adding a third. And what I mean by that is, adding capacity can come in the form of just adding capacity with our existing contract manufacturers or adding another contract manufacturer. And we felt the need to automate the facility more, bring more proximity to our headquarters and our engineers for some of the new product ramps and development, significantly increase our manufacturing capacity, and also bring several operational flexibilities to our business, including the impact of litigation. Marc Taxay, do you want to talk about that some more? Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : Sure. So I think as Jayshree said, there were a number of different considerations that we took into account in bringing on the new contract manufacturer. In factoring in the litigation to that, I think it's really important to understand that. The ITC is continuing to review initial determination, so that remains open. They haven't issued a final determination. But if we do receive a final determination that's adverse, we're of course going to respect the decision of the ITC and fully comply with it. And as we've said many times before, the primary strategy for us in the event of an adverse decision would be to implement design-arounds, so that our products would be non-infringing. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Jayshree, can you hear me? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I heard Jayshree, and then you cut off, Paul. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess, you could hear me in part. So my basic question \u2013 I apologize if you've addressed this in your initial remarks, but while we all focus on the cloud titans, understandably, my question would be on the balance of your business with Fortune 500, especially, but Fortune 500 and beyond. Can you give us any incremental insight in terms of the progress from both the customer breadth expansion standpoint, as well as the customer depth of penetration? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, actually we're very pleased with the deployment of cloud, and clearly the cloud titans are creating hyperscale networks. But I want to reiterate, Paul, that it isn't just the cloud titans. We're seeing a very nice mix of service providers, high tech enterprise and financials. And all of them have contributed in Q1 2016 to adoption of the cloud. I'll reiterate that the scale of the cloud is always far greater with the titans. But the deployment of the cloud is across all four verticals. So we feel good. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Jayshree, I know you don't give the mix on a quarterly basis, but can you give us some sense of what the growth rate looks like for the non-titan business? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is definitely double-digits, and higher than our average growth rates. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Higher than your average growth. Okay. Perfect. One other quick follow-up. On the gross margin, I respect the fact that you want to be conservative, but given that with the benefit of large-volume customers, you're still putting up relatively strong gross margin \u2013 and relative to your admonitions about the risk, the downside risk from other large deals, it appears that 64%, 64%-plus is what you could generate even with these big volume purchasers. Is there anything that should change going forward relative to that 64%? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Paul, in general I do feel strongly that you should consider our long-term band to be 60% to 65%, particularly as we bring more capacity into the United States and we have some additional costs. But in addition to that, remember we're still in a very competitive environment where average ASPs for 10-gig for sure are still coming down. And while we're seeing a nice uptake in the acceptance of 100-gig, there is no reason to imagine that we would trade off maintaining gross margin for market share. In other words, we're still going all-out for increasing our market share. In fact, when even I talk to our board, they say, you can do even better than increasing their shares. So given that backdrop, I would still say our long-term gross margin is in the 60% to 65% range. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tal Liani - Bank of America : Hi. I had so many questions. I'll focus on one with two parts, maybe. First, you highlighted at the beginning, the routing opportunity. Are these products or is this product coming to replace the MX routers that are typically above the Spine to consolidate it together? And then what is the opportunity? How do you size the opportunity of this market? And how fast do you think it could ramp? Is there a loan qualification process ahead of you? Or testing with customers, et cetera? And one, just follow-up on something you said before. Can you discuss the pricing environment now given that Cisco discussed their prices for 100G or discussed their prices publicly? Is this more aggressive than you had expected? Or do you expect this market to be more price-competitive in the future, versus before because of Cisco's pricing? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Wow. That's a lot of one question. Tal Liani - Bank of America : I'm not very good with math. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh. Thank you, Tal. So regarding our routing opportunity, as I said, I'm very proud of the 7500R Series. It's a fantastically well-designed, well-architected product, lot of third-party acceptance and independent benchmarks. I would look at the 7500R in sort of two applications. One is in the traditional data center market we already are, where it is being accepted by our existing customers as a natural 100-gig Spine. So we believe the qualifications and the deployment of a 100-gig Spine will be quicker there, because these are customers who already know that, and by quicker, I mean it can be one to three quarters. So I view that as a positive. In terms of the Spine being a router, replacing things like the MX or others, that would be a longer qualification time, because while it's not a different platform, there will be a qualification, and there will be a testing bed that is longer than one or two quarters. So I would say, over there, it can be six months to a year. So the material effect of the 7500R will be faster in the switching application, so it's 100-gig Spine, and will be second half to next year for routing applications. And in general, even in the short time we've had \u2013 we launched this product March 29. So here we are with less than six weeks of data. The reception has been very positive. Tal Liani - Bank of America : Got it. And on pricing? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tal. On pricing, no change. Competitors continue to be aggressive, and we continue to be competitive. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Yeah, thanks. I have two micro-questions. So Jayshree, there's been some discussion about changes to your go-to-market strategies. I was wondering if you could address that? And then Mark, in case \u2013 again, this is hypothetical \u2013 in case of product injunctions, could this domestic CM fully support your existing product portfolio? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, Alex. So I'm going to ask Mark Smith, our Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, to address our sales strategy question. I think, few people realize that our engineering strategy is disruptive, but so is our sales, Mark, right? Mark Stephen Smith - Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales Operations : Yeah. Thank you, Jayshree. And it is disruptive. You know, I've been in the industry over 35 years, I guess, that makes me old. But during that time, I haven't seen a traditional sales model that resembles what we do at Arista. Our model is very differentiated from a go-to-market. First of all, many customers or companies talk about customer focus. But few companies have as flat an organization as we have in sales, where all of our VPs and managers all own accounts personally, along with the fact that our engineers, our engineering management and leadership team are actively involved in every large customer. Secondly, our product focus, as we've probably reiterated many, many times, Arista delivers best-of-breed data center switching and routing. That's all we do. And our sales team become trusted advisors to customers, where they are extremely competent technically to be able to help customers meet their needs. The third area on our go-to-market is the cloud everywhere focus. We are in the business of building large clouds across the world. We call that the Cloud Scale. And we take that functionality and deliver it to our top vertical, which we call Cloud-Class. And in addition, this allows us to enable our enterprise customers to build turnkey-converged and hybrid cloud solutions, which we call Cloud Converged. Finally, on our go-to-market, we have a very, very deep focus on our specific verticals where we know that we can add huge values. Many times we talk about intense focus in cloud titans, financial services, service providers, web and the high tech enterprise. Rather than spreading a mile wide, we focus on going a mile deep in these verticals. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wow. Thanks, Mark. You're not old. We're middle-aged. If you're old, I am too. That was a great summary. And we really are proud of our go-to-market, and what Mark and the team have done to build customer intimacy, which along with our excellent products, really gives a total differentiated experience. Alex, did you have a \u2013 did we answer your question? You said you had a micro-question. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Yeah, the other micro-question was just, could this domestic CM, in the case of product injunctions allow you to basically continue supply of your existing product, if you have a domestic CM like you're talking about? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Marc, you want to take that? Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : Yeah, sure. Alex, as we had mentioned earlier, in the event of an adverse decision, our primary strategy here is the technical design-arounds... Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Yep. I understand. Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : That is the strategy. I think your question was, would the CM here in the U.S. support manufacturing of all our products, and the answer to that is, yes. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Absolutely. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Two very quick questions. One, could you just give us some sense of what happened in the financial vertical in the quarter? There was a lot of discussion about the financial vertical being quite soft in January and February, and should we assume that maybe that was a little soft, and it would come back more in later quarters? And then the second one is just on the routing product. We talked about this with you back last year. You kind of implied, it was 2017 before it was going to impact revenues in any way. Has that timeline changed at all, now that you've announced this product a lot sooner than I thought you'd be getting it out? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Alex. The financials \u2013 we are still seeing strong interest from them. Definitely they've spent less in the last quarter, and the last second half, I would say. But I think, going into Q2 \u2013 and this year, we expect our spending to be good. Maybe not super strong, but we don't see weakness the way others are describing. So, pretty good. In terms of routing and routers and what acceptance, six weeks don't make a trend, but I have to tell you the excitement, the enthusiasm and the differentiation of VR (31:20). We definitely think we will see material impact in 2017, and maybe with a little bit of customer qualification acceleration, we could see it sooner. But we're still planning on 2017. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. I wanted to dig in into the workaround situation. It's good to hear that the contract manufacturing could solve that problem if that problem arises, but can you give us an update on the workarounds, the level of preparedness and ability to permanently solve the problem if you get the wrong court decision? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. I think we said this before, and then again I'll have Marc clarify this from a legal perspective, there are two cases in ITC; 944 Investigation and 945 Investigation. We have had an initial determination on 944 Investigation, but as you know it's still under commission review, and there is no final determination. Should we get a final determination this summer, we are absolutely prepared with the right design workarounds and engineering workarounds, and we're very comfortable with that. 945 Investigation, you might have heard, has been delayed by a few months so that is a separate case. And we have similar comfort, but it is later in the year. Marc, you want to add to that? Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : The only other thing I would add is that, with respect the technical design arounds in the 944 Investigation, we actually will have an image \u2013 a separate image ready and available in Q2 \u2013 actually, this month. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, perfect. We have been ready in trials in Q1, so we'll be ready for general availability in Q2. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Very good. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. A real simple quick clarification, and then a question. On the clarification, it was pretty quick. I missed the tax rate for the quarter for the \u2013 sorry, for the outlook of 2Q. And in terms of my question, Jayshree, last quarter, I had asked you for an update on partnerships because you have a number of those that I think help in terms of competing against some of the larger players. So I was looking for an update on \u2013 and maybe some metrics on your partnership strategy with folks like Hewlett-Packard, VMware, Palo Alto. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Simon, thank you. I remember it well, and I will come back to you with metrics. But if I had to give you a qualitative answer right now, I would say the partnerships are going very well. Our top partners are VMware, HP and Palo Alto Networks. If I had to add a number set of partners that I'm getting excited about, it would be in the media and entertainment space, where we had a very successful broadcasting show last month. And also stay tuned for some exciting things we're doing in storage. So I still owe you metrics, but qualitatively I'm very pleased. And actually, Mark, since you're with us, and you deal with this much more. Maybe you can broaden Simon's question and spare with us how things are going in the channel and the technology partners. Mark Stephen Smith - Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales Operations : Yeah. Actually, I had the chance over the last three weeks to go to the VMware Partner Leadership Conference down in Phoenix and Tempe. And it's something that we really got quite excited about, because that week, followed by the Palo Alto Ignite event in Las Vegas, what we saw was a lot more interest from the channels, globally. And this is really exciting to us, because as an emerging company, we've developed a lot of the end-user customers ourselves. But now we're seeing, with the integration with our key partners, an unbelievable opportunity to provide a more comprehensive solution. And it's all based on being open. So I would say, from a partnership standpoint, we're seeing more momentum, both with the combined sales organizations with VMware, Palo Alto, HP, et cetera, and from a product standpoint where we're able to provide better solutions, as Jayshree addressed, like the Macro-Segmentation, which is getting just outstanding reviews. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark. And you had a tax rate question. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. The guidance was 27% to 29%, Simon. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Good afternoon, Jayshree and Ita. Jayshree, the adjacent routing platform is a great new market opportunity for Arista. How should we think of customer profiles that fit your routing platform target, especially those with significantly smaller network resources than Netflix? Will your routing customers require sizeable network resources to implement it? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Hendi. No, I think it's a very natural extension from where we are. Be clear that, Arista has been doing switching and routing for a long time. We've been doing BGP routing for several years. We're doing multicast routing; we're doing VXLAN routing. What we've really done with the R Series is expand the scale and expand the routing protocols and Internet tables with FlexRoute. So now we now have selective route downloads, segment routing, MPLS, LBP-type routing. And we're really bringing in additional WAN protocols and a level of high availability. So I don't think it's a dramatic change in our customers' learning, nor in our SE (37:06) and sales force understanding. But it will take time to associate Arista with that and qualify it. But in terms technology adjacency, it's very natural. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and great results. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Hendi. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. Question or clarification, first, just on the clarification, can you help understand with the workaround, how long the ITC's review is likely to take following the final determination? Is that something that we should expect to be weeks or months; any kind of insight there? And then for, Ita, it looks to me like you underspent, at least our expectations a bit in Q1, particularly on the sales and marketing side, even though revenue is fairly strong. So I was hoping to understand what happened there, and given you've been struggling to grow expenses faster than sales for multiple quarters now, what leads you believe operating margins are likely to dip to 26% in Q2? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Marc, this is an earnings call, and thank you for the wishes, Jess, but once again, this question's for you on what do we expect the ITC timeframe to be? Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : Yeah. I mean, I think just taking a step back, if there is an adverse decision in the ITC, full compliance with an order would be essentially having non-infringing products. I think that's the most important thing. Yet, clarity around that, there are different paths to get those approved, and we'll make a decision if there is a final determination that's adverse to us, we'll make a decision at that point as to the appropriate path to follow in order to be able to get some clarity around approval. In terms of timing, the timing varies greatly, and I don't think that we can provide you any sort of detail around the timing. It just depends on the process. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think, in terms of the operating expenses, I think if you look Q4 to Q1, we did see some good growth on the R&D side, and we expect that to continue. We're obviously hiring as much talent and resources as we can find. And we also have some other expenses associated with the workarounds and the designs-arounds and so on. So that's a number that I would certainly like to keep some optionality around how that number grows over the next coming quarters. So that's part of why, I think you're seeing that spread on OpEx. On the sales side, Q4 is typically a high, variable comp quarter with sales commissions and so on. I think we saw that as well. We are hiring sales head count, again, in all regions. And as fast as Mark is finding those people, we are hiring them, and it's our intention to continue to do that. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think we have increased sales head count every quarter. So there's no change there. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Would you expect sales and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue, going forward or is 10% or lower kind of the new normal? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think longer-term you should expect that to be 10% to 12% at least of revenue. How fast we get there, kind of depends on our growth, but certainly in my mind it should be a double-digit percentage of revenue, right. And that's our expectation over time. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Great. So most of the questions have been asked. I guess, Jayshree, with all new chipsets, there's supply constraints, and we've talked about supply constraints with Jericho. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is have those supply constraints improved? Your guidance would suggest otherwise, but perhaps your guidance doesn't bake in much in the way of the 7500R platform. So just try and help us understand that dynamic, and how to think about it over the next, call it, six months to 12 months? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So I think, one of the things you heard \u2013 thanks, Ryan \u2013 Ita say is we're really working on building the right inventory mix of new product and existing product. And you are right; there are a lot of chips in the mix here, existing chips as well as new chips like Tomahawk and Jericho. But be clear, there's still an awful lot of going on with Trident and (41:36), so we're dealing with a tremendous amount of component variety with varying levels of lead times. And typically these lead times require us to plan our forecast three months to four months in advance because the lead times for the components can be that long. So no material change there from our vendors, but they're certainly working very closely with us, and we factor that in like we always do. And this is true by the way both for new products and existing products, so we aren't seeing it just on Jericho or just on one type. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : The 7500R though is based on Jericho? Or could it be based on... Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the 7500R specifically is based on Jericho. You're right. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. So my question is really around adoption of that platform and what's embedded in guidance, and what's not? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, got it. Separate from the supply constraints, as I said, we announced the platform March 29, we started shipping in Q2 and the acceptance and the reception has \u2013 we are already into double digit customers. And a tremendous amount of the acceptance is as a 100-gigabit Spine. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Jayshree, Ita. Solid results here. A quick question and a follow-up. The question is on, could we expect the design win, Jayshree, for the 7500R solid product at one of the major U.S. telcos this year? For example, AT&T's dead serious with their NFV roll-out and the Jericho router seems to be a good fit for NFV. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Vijay, you're asking me to speculate something I don't have an answer to. Let's just say, I've read more press about it than I can comment on. But I think the more general answer, rather than specific to a Tier 1 would be, the 7500 is a very natural product for large-scale cloud and service providers, both Tier 1 and Tier 2. So you would expect we're seeing a lot of interest in collapsing two layers that are very costly for them today, and bringing both OpEx and CapEx advantages to them. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. And then a bigger picture question, Jayshree, on your channel strategy, a little confused here. Over the next few years, what percentage of revenues would you expect to see come from indirect channel versus direct sales? And how strategic do you view the channel for expanding sales into enterprise, and some of these telco opportunities over the next few years? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, thank you. And since I have my good friend Mark Smith here, I'm going to ask for his help here. But first of all, I think there's a misnomer on Arista that while we're extremely customer-focused and end customer-focused, the channel is an enabler and a very large percentage of our business is enabled and even fulfilled through channels. Mark, you want to comment more on this? Mark Stephen Smith - Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales Operations : Well I think, first of all, internationally it's virtually 100% of our business flows through channels. And the benefit we have by having the best technology is, we have this elite program in our channel that actually is self-selecting where the best networking partners actually pick up Arista. And then when you look at the other technology companies in this space that are providing the best solutions, they combine them with those. So I think what you're going to see is, the channel becoming more and more important to us over time. And I think, we're still early, Jayshree, in the actual development of the channel. But I think it is really important to us. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's very true. And the channel for us means more than just channel partners. It also means our technology partners. So it's a much more holistic approach to that. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Yeah. Thanks, Jayshree. Solid results. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vijay. Thanks for your support. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rajesh Ghai with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on a question \u2013 on a response that you gave earlier on a question, Jayshree, about internal development efforts at the cloud titans. You said, you were working with them in the initiatives, providing them the drivers and other software-based application control elements and their initiatives. In the future when someone like Microsoft or Facebook begins to use their own operating system, does that mean a reduction in scope for Arista? In that situation, how do you continue to kind of maintain or grow the gross profit pool that you earn from those customers that you earn today? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Rajesh, that's an excellent question, and I know it's one that many of you view as it's either/or; I view it as and. I think if we work with them closely on software stacks, take a large titan, they generally have multiple tiers of Leafs and multiple tiers of Spines. And it is quite possible that one of those tiers of Leafs may be software-only from Arista, or maybe a joint software development from Arista, and the cloud titan, but it still keeps a lot of opportunity available for us in other application. So I think, you are going to see different strokes and different folks and different building blocks. And especially the Tier 0 Leaf could be one that we do more as software-only, should the cloud titan want to go there. So we don't rule that out. And in terms of profit pool, it can actually be pretty good in gross margin, even if the gross margin percentages \u2013 even if the dollars maybe lower. So we view this as a portfolio. We don't view this as one particular product. Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rajesh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask one clarification on gross margin, and then a larger question. Gross margins, when we think about the second half dipping as low as 61% for the second half, given the change in the manufacturing and just some of the customer mix? So that's one. And then just on the larger question, here, which is the main question. As you get more involved with the Spine and the 7500R ramps; how should we think about the cloud titan exposure that you have? Are you in a position to expand your business, particularly in the Spine, with customers that maybe \u2013 have been more prone to using white boxes before? And now that this product is making more attractive for them to use you for more of their network \u2013 so that's really the nature of the question. And then if that extends into the international growth this quarter as well \u2013 if that's what the existing customers, or that was for new customers? Thanks a lot. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wow. Okay. Thank you, Stanley. We'll try. Ita, you want to take the gross margin question? And I'll address the Spine. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, I think the way to think about the impact of the manufacturing on gross margin is, we'll start to produce volume probably in Q3. And the first time we'll really be selling product from that factory and having an impact on the financials will be in Q4, and then into 2017. So I think that impact is really something to think about, as you look in to next year, right? And again, it's early to start to really try to size that. I think what we're seeing is, we believe in all scenarios we can be in that range. And then we'll refine that as we go. But it's more kind of a Q4 and into 2017 effect. And we'll refine that as we get closer to that. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so with respect to Spines and white box, maturity of the white box activity or the things you see tend to be in the Leaf, in simple single-chip configuration. The spine is a more difficult thing, especially in the chassis to do. I don't say I preclude it, but I think what you'll see is many tiers of Leafs, many tears of Spines. With the Leaf, there will be more experimental project. But the Spine, especially with Arista's highly-differentiated product both on the architecture and on the EOS, we feel very comfortable, especially at 40-gig, 50-gig and 100-gig will be ours to lose. So back to the portfolio answer, I think, it will really be a mix and match, and white box may mean that they get standard hardware from somewhere, but may still consider our software. Spine really, I think is still very much a decision they make in totality with the vendor, because there's so much complexity in the scale, the switching, the routing, the high reliability that you really have to think twice before building core capability internally for that. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Thanks. And do you expect that the spine will be a greater portion of your revenue as we head into 2017 than it was in 2016? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's hard to predict at the moment, but I think it's not going to be something that just happened suddenly, one quarter or one year later. It's going to be gradual. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Great quarter, guys. Just wanted a quick question on the OpEx side. So knowing that you guys are bringing some more jobs onshore, could you maybe explain one, potentially what the strategic advantage is? And then secondly, is this going to inflate the OpEx line consistently as we go forward? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ita, you may want to answer it, but as I said, I think we seek several strategic advantages. We got a lot of new product going and having proximity to our engineering sides is one. I think, if I had to summarize it in a nutshell, it would be operational flexibility to conduct our business and provide our customers with continuous product. You want to address that some more? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, I think in terms of the financials and how it impacts the financials, I mean, this is really; it will be kind of a product cost impact if we see one, right? And then, like I said, I think that's something we would see Q4, and into next year, but it would be a product cost impact, but obviously we would work to optimize over time, right? It's not really an OpEx impact in the sense that these would be contract manufacturing resources and jobs that, Jayshree was mentioning. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. And then secondly, from an enterprise perspective outside the hyperscale, I mean, are you guys seeing share gains at this point? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're seeing overall share gain. Clearly, the titans are contributing to it, but so are the three verticals including the enterprise. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a question here for both, Jayshree and Mark. A lot of focus has been on the channel the enterprise mix during this call. I want to see \u2013 are we missing something here in terms of \u2013 there's a bigger dynamic here, whereby because of the change in how technology has been procured and implemented that a lot of folks are now just going with the cloud providers or a private cloud type of apparatus? You don't have to really focus maybe on the channel or the enterprise per se, as maybe traditionally was the focus. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, I think you hit the nail on the head quite honestly, Mark, because it's something we've been saying because we keep getting asked why is our sales and marketing so low, instead of why is your sales and marketing so successful and targeted. And I think, Mark and his team have done a fantastic job with that. You want to comment, Mark, on why it's so fantastic? Mark Stephen Smith - Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales Operations : No comments. But I will say, Mark, one thing that I'll say is, having been \u2013 this is my fourth public company, having been in a lot of companies with a lot of good product, a big differentiator for my sales organization is product quality. You can't go to an executive briefing here at Arista if you're a prospect or customer without hearing about quality, quality, quality, quality and we look at every P1 that comes across. We have a massive customer that in 2015, one of my reps comes out, and he goes do you realize they didn't have a single switch fail in the entire year? So I'll tell you, from a sales standpoint they're enabling us to be efficient, that's the number enabler is product quality. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. This if I could clarify too for Ita here, real quickly on gross margin, the commentary around long-term of 60% to 65%, what is that trying to prepare us for? Is that due to mix related to product or customer or is that due to any sort of loyalty dimension that could be introduced here, because of the ongoing litigation? Is there any sort of preparation around us getting ready for immediate royalty payment that would be a slight minor drag on gross margin? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : No. I think the reiteration of that on this call is really around the manufacturing and the impact of bringing up a new factory and a new CM with potentially maybe a slightly disadvantaged cost structure at least in the beginning, right? So I think really, that's what we're referencing. Just to provide some context in terms of what would the ramp of that new factory do to gross margins, we're really just restating, that would still stay within the 60% to 65%, and that's really what it was intended to do, nothing more than that. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. What's really nice is, a new manufacturing facility means everything is highly automated. You get to bring brand new machines and you get to spend lots of money. The flip side of that is you also have some increased labor and wages, and overheads from that initially, until we streamline the operation and get the cost out of it. Nothing different than we saw early on when we even started our first and second contract manufactures, but it is a process, and it is a multi-year process. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Our final question's here, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. You said that the pricing environment really hasn't changed, but I was just curious. Your competitors have some new systems out. Cisco announced some a few months ago. The Juniper QFX10k just started shipping last quarter. Are you seeing these products in competitive situations? And is it impacting anything? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, we've been always seeing different products from different companies, and they've always been aggressive and competitive. And when I say it hasn't changed, I mean the aggression continues in the same way it always has. No different. There's always been a level of dynamic and highly-competitive and highly-pressured on the price, but since we've always experienced it, there's no change in the aggression. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks so much. Jayshree, I just wanted to add some context around the earlier discussion of white box adoption at the cloud titans. Is your Cloud revenue primarily tilted to the Leaf versus the Spine? And maybe you can quantify that for us. And then I have a quick one for, Ita as well. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Simona. Thank you. No, our Cloud Scale and cloud titans are very much a mix of both, and sometimes it's Leaf, sometimes it's Spine, sometimes it's more Leaf and sometimes it's more Spine. So I wouldn't read too much, but I will say one thing we see in common is, there's a more rapid migration to the Leaf being 25-gig and 50-gig, and the Spine being 100-gig. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, Jayshree. And then Ita, you had very strong services growth, much faster than products. Can you talk a little bit about what is driving that? And also what kind of attach are you seeing with your cloud customers for services? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Simona, I think Q4 is typically \u2013 kind of Q4 into Q1 is typically a good, strong services quarter, right; and you tend to see a fair amount of renewals and so on happen in that timeframe. That's really what's driving that. I mean, the attach rate across the board is pretty high, right? Customers value the service, and there aren't too many customers who'd like to run a network without service coverage, right. So I think, the attach rate for all customers is pretty high. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And it's very competitively priced, and brings meaningful service. So... Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Chuck Elliott - Director, Product and Investor Advocacy : Great. So this concludes the Arista Q1 2016 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation which provides additional perspective on our first quarter 2016 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good job, guys. Operator : Thank you for joining ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call, you may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott - Director, Product and Investor Advocacy : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2016. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had another strong quarter. Our revenue exceeded consensus meaningfully, as we grew 37.4% year-over-year to $268.7 million while earnings per share grew to $0.74. New and differentiated EOS platform sealed our growth across our top verticals, and services contributed over 12% of our overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas generated 75% of our total revenue, while our international theaters progressed steadily through the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.1% in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. We now have approximately 4,000 cumulative customers, and they're enthusiastic about the rate of customer adoption especially of CloudVision, with over 100 customers in less than a year from its introduction. In Q2, we unveiled the next generation of Universal Leaf, with its many roles, called the Arista 7280R Series. Unlike other fixed-function devices, the 7280R is our value-driven leaf with multiple use cases for routing, storage and digital media. When combined with our FlexRoute technology for diverse protocols, the 7280R challenges the notion of separate routers, by combining multi-purpose routing and switching functions into a small 1RU or 2RU compact form factor. With its chassis companion that we launched in March, the 7500R, we embark on our expansion into adjacent core and WAN routing markets. It also aligns closely with our growing storage ecosystem of partners including EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NetApp SolidFire, Nutanix and Pure Storage to bring reliable lots of IP storage as a compelling alternative to legacy Fiber Channel SANs. The 7280R also underscores Arista's Media and Entertainment initiative, with key partnerships such as Aperi Corporation, Imagine Communications, Lawo and Nevion, and participation in many next-generation organizations, including the AIMS Alliance, Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, AVnu Alliance and Video Services Forum. Arista has been powering slow-motion replay video to real-time sports streaming, most recently at the 2016 European Football Championship and at the upcoming Rio Olympics. As I look back at our first half and we move into our second half, we are executing well towards our goals, our product strategy, and our dual-pronged operation strategy for world-class automated manufacturing. In light of the recent International Trade Commission decisions with the 944 Investigation, Arista has released a new EOS 4.16, which contains design rounds that we believe address the specific features that we have found to be infringing. Our major customers are actively qualifying, or have already completed certification off the EOS 4.16 release. There should be no doubt about our commitment to our customers, and to our compliance with law and ITC orders. Arista finds itself in the midst of a tornado market, with migration from legacy IT silos, to public, private, and hybrid workloads in the cloud. We are expanding our inventory and operational capacity in anticipation of demand. We are excited about our prospects and our acceptance of our software-driven cloud networking vision. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for our quarterly financials and more specifics. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 2016 is based on (6:17 \u2013 6:27) results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q2 were $268.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, and above our guidance of $259 million to $265 million. Our cloud titan verticals demonstrated continued strength in the second quarter, combined with healthy growth from the other key verticals. Service revenues grew with the business, representing 12.3% of revenues, consistent with last quarter. International revenues came in at $68 million or 25% of total revenue, up from 24% last quarter. While we continue to focus on expanding our international footprint, you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployment. Overall, gross margin in Q2 was 64.1%, down slightly from last quarter at 64.4%, but favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 62% to 65%, and consistent with a healthy cloud titan revenue mix. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $97.3 million, up 13.5% from last quarter. R&D spending was 22.9% of revenue, reflecting growth in head count, and some incremental prototype, and in our reinvestments associated with new products, and designed around activities related to the 945 ITC case. Sales and marketing expense was 10.4%, up from 9.9% last quarter, reflecting increased head count and related expenses. Our operating income for the quarter was $75 million, or 27.9% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.3 million, and our effective tax rate was 28.1%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $53.7 million, or 20%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 72.8 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $0.74, up 37% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $7.6 million for the quarter, below our outlook of $8 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at $823.8 million. We generated $54.9 million of cash from operations in the June quarter. DSOs came in at 50 days, down from 51 days in Q1. We are pleased to see continued progress in this area during the quarter. Inventory turns were 3.5 times, down slightly from 3.6 times in Q1. Inventory increased to $118.1 million in the quarter, up from $84 million in the prior period. This increase reflects additional inventory associated with our new contract manufacturer, as discussed in the prior call. Our deferred revenue balance was $230.3 million, up from $219.2 million in Q1. This balance continues to be large, and made up of short-term and long-term service contracts, with some product deferrals related to acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 56 days, up from 26 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2016, with revenues and earnings per share up more than 36% on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and we're seeing good adoption of our new products and we continue to execute well on the delivery and design-arounds as required in response to the ITC rulings. As discussed on the March call, we began the process of adding a new contract manufacturer in Q2. We've made good progress in this regard, having qualified most of our products on the new production lines. We expect to ramp volumes in Q3 and should see products from the new plan contributing meaningfully to revenue in the fourth quarter. In terms of effects on the financials, we saw some increases in inventory in Q2 and would expect this growth to continue into the third quarter. Our current view is that we will increase our investment in inventories by further $100 million as compared to our Q2 balance sheet position. As we bring our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain capabilities online, we expect to see some increase in costs and as a result, all other things being equal, some reduction in gross margins. We believe these impacts could result in gross margins that range from 60% to 65% depending on how heavily weighted our revenue mix is towards products manufactured out of our new U.S. manufacturing facility and its associated supply chain activities. Our outlook for Q3 assumes that while some product sales will come from the new production plant, the majority of our sales will come from products sourced overseas. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows. Revenues of approximately $279 million to $285 million, gross margin of approximately 62% to 65% and operating margin of approximately 26%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 27% to 29% with diluted shares of approximately 73 million. Please note that based on our current understanding, we expect cost associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $11 million for the quarter. At this time, we would like to open the line up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. On today's call, we request that you please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another nice quarter. Maybe just first for Jayshree, you can touch on whether there were any 10% customers in the period and outside of the cloud titans, where you saw the strength, how you're feeling about visibility going into the second half? And then for Ita, I was hoping you could touch on domestic supply with respect to components and in the event the workarounds aren't approved by Q4, how confident are you in your ability to purchase all of the components to build all of your products domestically and is everything available here in the volumes you would need? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jess. So, as you know, we don't comment on 10% customers on a quarterly basis, but if I look at the trends for the year and all four verticals are contributing double-digit percentages to the company, the strongest contribution is coming from our cloud titans, which is not just one of them but many of them. I think as a category, they're spending very strongly in the first half of the year and this would explain why the strength of Arista and the macro economies has been less of a contributor to Arista's results. So feeling pretty good about the cloud titans, but feeling quite good about the financials, the service providers, and the web and high tech enterprise as well. Ita, you want to answer the second half? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, and then I think in terms of thinking about our plans as we move through the rest of the year, we've been pretty consistent in saying that we've taken some steps from the supply chain and inventory perspective to give us some flexibility as we work through getting customs approval on the design-arounds, right, and I think that's still the strategy. I think well you have seen us grow the inventory significantly. We'll continue to do that in Q3. All of that's taken to give us that flexibility and we're obviously working very hard to get customs approval in a timely manner and that's obviously a big part of the strategy. But we have taken those other steps as well. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Any update on where customs is in the approval process and when we might hear something there? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : No, I think it's a process, but obviously there's been some communication back and forth, but it's an ongoing process and we'll have to wait and see when they're done with their efforts. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Jayshree, on your web scale business, just if you could comment on the second tier accounts and how that install base has grown and whether or not going into 2017 maybe the business is a little bit more balanced out of that vertical as opposed to the prior years where a couple of really large accounts drove a big chunk of that segment? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think \u2013 Thanks, Alex. I think that's an excellent question and one we don't spend enough time on because we tend to think of our cloud business as just the titans. But we are indeed seeing a very nice uptick, both domestically and internationally in our web scale business of the next tier of cloud providers. And I think a lot of these cloud providers are natural experts in building scale both in their own enterprise and being able to offer hybrid cloud services. And what's interesting about that is you would have assumed that to be true in the domestic regions, but we're also seeing it internationally. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is open. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you spoke a little bit about all of the different product extension and storage and other segments that are driving some of the growth. Can you help us understand what portion of revenue is coming from these or at least the growth coming from these this quarter, next quarter and for the balance of the year? And I also have a quick follow-up for the international side of the business. If you're seeing any impact especially in Europe or Great Britain, given your financials' exposure to the Brexit vote. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks, Stanley. Is your question you want to understand contribution of revenue by product? Is that what you're asking? Verticals. Okay. So as I said before, there are four verticals that contribute a very large percentage, which is the cloud titans, the service providers, the high tech enterprise, which also includes the web scale providers and the financials. There is no question that cloud titans are spending and contributing and they're increasing budget, while networking as a small component has an influence on us. However, the other three businesses are contributing and growing as well. And the same is true internationally. It's just that cloud titans spend and their budgets are a lot more. So we are, unlike some of the macro situations, we are seeing spend in service providers, in financials, in the cloud hosting and Internet hosting, in the high tech enterprise and some of the media entertainment verticals, in the government. All of these end customers are contributing greatly, both internationally and domestically. In dollars and numbers, the cloud titan budgets tend to be bigger. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just to clarify, I was hoping to get a sense of the contribution to growth from application. So, storage and traditional business... Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, yes. That's a good question. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): (18:23) thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's a good question. I'll answer it broadly, but I think there are more specifics you are looking for. One of the things we see particularly with the three out of the four verticals is they tend to start with a project. And the project like you pointed out will be the compute or storage or security or data monitoring. And the applications therefore can be four or five. Of course, all of them are centered on a specific data center project. So, the typical four or five are the ones I listed. The fifth one is probably a DevOps or what you'd call SDN or containerization or virtualization applications. So, the five top projects are these. They quickly, in a few months or sometimes a year, move into what I call mainstream, where they then look in to build out a whole scale of service or data center. So it depends on the stage of the customer, but they almost always start out as a project. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to get a sense here, if I could, around the gross margin beyond the September quarter, how should investors kind of prepare, Ita, for the impact from the U.S. manufacturing operations? It's a question that comes up almost every other day or every day for us, so if you could address that more in terms of should we expect a step down of a couple of hundred basis points and then a step back up? And is it temporary or can it be more of a permanent impact? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I think there are a number of different drivers there, obviously. We've set the range of 60% to 65%, thinking about 60% as a world where we're heavily dependent on the U.S. manufacturing plants plus supply chain. And then 65% obviously being where there's no impact from any of these effects, right? I think in Q3, we're pretty much in a normal situation using offshore supplies. I think as we move into Q4, we'll see more products from the manufacturing plants than we'll sell in that quarter, but we're probably still leveraging an overseas supply chain, right? So that will be somewhat of a muted impact, but there will be some impact. Beyond that, honestly, it depends on what happens with the customs approval, what's the timing of that, where do we source components and finished goods as we move through Q1. I think the best way to think about it beyond that is if we're heavily dependent, we're at the lower end of that range. If we're not, then we're somewhere in the middle to the upper end of that range. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then a follow-up for Jayshree, it's more a philosophical question, I guess, but also strategic. There seems to be a lot of noise over the past month or so around Arista's affinity towards the channel. Can you maybe just address your view on the channel and the importance of the channel? It seems like it's a lot more important than you're getting credit for. But just want to get a sense if you could kind of address that. How those people think about or investors think about the next couple of years as you do grow beyond your core business? (21:24) help you out. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, absolutely, Mark. I think Arista has always been unique in its approach for go-to-market and sales, including the channel. As you know, just to step back a little, when Mark Smith was here in the last call, he highlighted the fact that we're going after three categories; cloud class, which is our top four verticals, cloud converged, which is more of a turnkey solution for enterprise, and this is really where our partners, both our channel partners and our technology partners come in, right? And then cloud scale, which tends to be the direct cloud providers. So if you zoom in on where our partners are meaningful, it's really technology partners and channel partners. And channel partners especially internationally have always been a huge element of it. So, Arista's go-to-market strategy's really three-pronged, and one prong of that is very channel-driven. And that's very much the enterprise and turnkey solutions that we have to provide both with our technology partners and our channel partners. And another prong of that is outside the domestic area we're greatly dependent on all our categories being fulfilled and driven through channels more. So hopefully our commitment to the channels is clear, but our focus on quality channels rather than just signing up a whole bunch of them is also clear. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I had one clarification which is on your gross margin comment, Ita, and that is could you help us understand what the timing on whatever impacts we're going to have will be like. By when do you think most of this will have affected gross margins and will be at sort of a steady state? Could you just kind of restate that for us, give us any further color you can give? And then I guess my question is on seasonality. The H2 on H1 seasonality we had anticipated would be relatively high, considering availability of 25-Gig mix and availability of 100-Gig networking. And so I think most people on this call that are tracking that expect second half of the year to be accelerating from a hyperscale deployment point of view. And I just wonder if you guys could comment on what you think H2 over H1 seasonality this year is going to look like? Do you think it'll be roughly similar to last year? Or do you think that, at least color-wise, we should see accelerating investment by these guys? Just give us some color on what's going on out there on the hyperscale, guys. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll take the second question first and then Ita can clarify the gross margin again. When we look at second half seasonality both last year and this year, we see a similar pattern, which is some of the cloud guys, their year ends in Q2, and so they have seasonality in Q3 and then they pick up in Q4, right? So, I don't think you'll see a big change in seasonality second half of last year to second half of this year. The trends will be the same. The numbers may be different because it depends on the level of commitment and investment. And from where we're sitting, almost every one of the major cloud providers in terms of numbers is looking to spend at or higher from last year to this year. So, seasonality patterns aren't varying, but their numbers themselves may vary. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : And then just to go back to the gross margin discussion again. I mean, I think the best way to think about this is that as you think about how we were transitioning through time, clearly, we are awaiting customs approval \u2013 we'll be awaiting customs approval in that timeframe. We'll be leveraging our U.S. manufacturing and our inventories that we've built up, right? Once we have approval, we'll have access to offshore manufacturing and components again, and then there will be the second case at some point in the future. So you should expect that we're going to navigate through this. There'll be some volatility, but at the end of the day, nothing has changed in the overall cost structure of the product other than what we have talked about, or in the competitive environment, right? So, I think about it as being temporary, and something that is going to be somewhat volatile as we go through the next number of quarters, right? And I've tried to bind it with the 60% to 65%, saying if we ended up being totally dependent on the U.S., we would be at the lower end. If we were in some hybrid model, which is where we probably will be for a lot of the time, we'd be somewhere in the middle of that range. And I can't give much more precision to that right now, because it's dependent on the timing of some of the legal decisions and so on. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome to your first call, Rod. Thank you. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, thank you, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Yes, hi, Jayshree, Ita. Solid results here. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, one of the things we've been kind of talking to clients is on the service provider opportunities, routing opportunity with merchant silicon. Like to hear any color you can give us on how that is coming along, and if you'd agree with us that merchant silicon routing would be disruptive to the service provider routing market. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vijay. And yes, you're always right on some of these technology and trends, and you're absolutely right. We see that the standalone router market is migrating more and more to switching and routing, on merchant silicon, with a really good software stack, and Arista is sitting in the middle of all of those trends. As I said in my prior call, we're very enthusiastic about both the 7500R Series, and the new companion we just announced in June, the 7280R, which is the fixed home factor, or the value lease, as we call it. Both these products are in trials, and they're being received well on the routing side. And they're being received very well on the switching side. On the common theme, I would see, we see in both cases is the need to adopt 100-Gig spines, and the value that's bringing in, because while it's easy to look at 100-Gig spines as a performance metric, it really is a flexible port speed where you can have 10 10s, four 25s, two 50s, 2.5 40s. So customers are really adopting that as their strategic spine, both for routing and switching. And that's very much favoring the trend that we're seeing. In terms of material effect, as I've often said to all of you, we'll be in a lot of trials and a lot of customer acceptance in the second half of this year. We think the real material effect is 2017. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. So, my question is around lead times, relative to last quarter. Maybe if you could touch on that, and then as part of that, we get a lot of questions around the potential for accelerated purchasing decisions by potentially some of your large customers, ahead of this new manufacturing capabilities. So you could speak to that. And then in addition, if you witnessed any challenges securing components. That's all sort of tied together. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's loaded part a, b, c, Ryan. You're very creative, but thank you. I think the lead times on our products are higher than the standard leads that I would like to see, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that, guys, we just introduced a tremendous amount of new product. So, the number one reason is, some of our suppliers are not able to meet the demand that we have put in front of them, and their lead times reflect our lead times. Our lead times are usually, as you know, in the four weeks to 10 weeks' time, depending on the type of product. But our suppliers' lead times can be as much as 22 weeks. So we've had to plan, we've had to forecast, we've had to budget, we've had to do inventory management, so it has been a non-trivial challenge, and particularly as we've had to do this across multiple manufacturing entities, that's added another layer of forecasting to this. So, I would just go on record saying we could do better, and we need to improve our lead times and our on-time shipments. This is an area of focus for us. And I think everything else after that is really tied to that. Our lead times are affected, and our product availability is affected by the component lead times, but also some of the planning we've had to do across multiple contract manufacturers in multiple locations. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And just as a follow-up, though, Jayshree... Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead, Ryan. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : ...any accelerated purchasing or request by customers? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're seeing purchasing tied to demand. We're not seeing any different or unusual behavior, besides the normal demand-related purchase. And I think what we've said, Ryan, is we'll call that out clearly if we do see that at some point. But for now, (30:31). Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I just want to be clear on one thing, on the customs department and the approval. Isn't there like a relatively fixed timeline. It sounds like... Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kulbinder, you're very soft spoken. We can't hear anything. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Can you hear me now? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's much better. Please, can you repeat your question? Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): My question is that the customs department approval process, isn't there a fixed timeline (31:12)? It sounds like there may not be. I'm just curious as to what their scheduled events is? And then the other thing that's linked to that, around whole process, is that in the event that you have to be very U.S.-oriented in manufacturing, couldn't you be redesigning your products to cost in the next generation? So you could take out some of that excess cost you're facing till gross margins go back up even if you have to do a very heavily reliant U.S. manufacturing business for some time, or is that not on the cards or not possible? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the second question first and then I'll let Marc Taxay, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel to comment on the customs process. I think in terms of cost reductions there are always many components to that, both in new product and in more mature products at high volume. Arista is aggressively taking out costs. But we're also aggressively bringing volume-driven pricing. So I think the two kind of balance each other, whether it's new product or not. And it has less to do with U.S. manufacturing. It's just got to do with being competitive. The things that can contribute to higher margin is if we start to increase the software content, things like CloudVision and FlexRoute, and software licenses could become greater components and are relatively small components now. And also if the mix of our product changes to more spine and less leaf or more software-driven leaf, that could also help. So I think product mix can have \u2013 and customer types can have a greater contribution than purely U.S.-driven optimizations, to answer your question. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Kulbinder, the important thing is obviously we will have design-arounds and we will work to get those design-arounds approved. And in that scenario we'll have access to domestic and overseas components, etcetera again. So this is very much a temporary navigation as we go through this time period as cases are heard and resolved. But the goal obviously is to design \u2013 have design-arounds in the products that allow us to go and access overseas offshore components, etcetera again, right? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Marc, can you comment on the customs process? Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : Sure. So customs does not provide for a specific timeframe to get customs approval; however, we've been actively working with customs, and they've been working very expeditiously to get the customs approval done as quickly as possible. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes, congrats on a good quarter. On the inventory front, I was thinking you might see a bigger increase in the current quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you're planning the inventory that you're going to build up? What kind of timeframe are you going to be satisfying with what you're going to currently retain at the end of the September quarter, and how are you planning to add to that as the timeline progresses? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I think what I said in my remarks was that we'd expect to grow the inventory balance at the end of Q2 by about another $100 million by the end of Q3, right? So there is still a significant amount of inventory that we will add over the coming month, two months, right? So, I think that... Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, you're right, Erik. We haven't added enough. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Right. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We added some and it's a strong function of getting the inventory we want. We don't want to add the wrong inventory. We did make progress during Q2 and we need to make more progress in Q3 and Q4. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Right. And I think that's pretty much committed from a supply perspective as we look into Q3. So you should see a bigger uptick in Q3. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Will you be able to dial down your contract manufacturer once you get approval until the next lawsuit comes up, or do you have to sustain certain volume levels to keep the contract manufacturing going? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : I think the way to think about this is the manufacturing in and of itself is not a big overhang from a cost perspective. It's really more at the supply chain. So we'll maintain obviously a volume there that keeps that entity (35:27) it's the supply chain that we'll dial up and down. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. (35:47) of saying I have one question, it's kind of two related components to this one. One, (35:55) transitioning to 25-Gig, 100-Gig architectures and a lot of those components are heavily supply constrained as the manufacturers are just starting to ramp those production lines. So does that create a situation where you have an inability to build enough of those components for the next generation architectures? And really that plays into the second part of the question which is really the most important piece. To the extent that you have a couple of month window before you are constrained from buying supplies internationally and you can't buy anymore supplies internationally until after the determination of your workarounds are legitimate. If the second tranche of patents is then put into play before you get through that window, in other words, the second tranche of patents gets its preliminary determination in, say, August and then final determination in December and you haven't come out of the workaround on the first one, and don't get another window to build inventory, will that mean that you would have enough capacity on the inventory that you've built to work through all the way to, say, July when that final determination on the second round of patents is determined? If these two overlap, can you get out to July without further damage to your business? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I think, Alex, it's really hard to speculate on exactly what's going to happen here. I mean, we've put a lot of thought and effort into multiple different strategies depending on what the outcomes are, right? Some of those are inventory-related, some of those are other plans, right? But we've been making plans for contingencies. I'm not going to guarantee you anything right here, but we've been very cognizant of the various outcomes, and we've made plans for those. Marc, I don't know, if you want to add anything to that. Marc Taxay - Vice President & General Counsel : Yes, the only other thing I would add \u2013 I guess I'd add two things. The first is that that would include changes to our supply chain in order to be able to source in compliance with the ITC orders, and the second is, and I think Ita mentioned this earlier, is that ultimately, if we are manufacturing products here in the United States, then any components, whether they are sourced here or internationally can be used in those products, again, as long as those products are not infringing. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's a really important point. We get caught up on product infringement, but remember the ITC found us to infringe two features out of thousands of features we have. So, with the U.S., 4.16 that we've been diligently working on building a non-infringed product for two features, which is 0.2%. We've really designed an ultimate product, and therefore we can build non-infringed product worldwide. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: So the piece that you didn't answer was the supply availability of the 25-Gig, 100-Gig components given an early ramp. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, they are, Alex. But we feel pretty good that over Q2, Q3 and Q4, we can address the lead time and component availability issue. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Alex. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Just a follow-up to that and some of the other questions. When you look at availability and lead times, how much of an improvement are you anticipating and building into your outlook for the September quarter? And along those same lines, is availability at all hampering your opportunity to get test units of the new 7500R into service providers, et cetera, and has that changed your outlook for initial qualifications, et cetera? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, James. So first of all, availability has not changed our outlook and interest in service providers. We're very good about providing the requisite early field trials or seed units or testing units. So we haven't seen any change there. What was your first part of the question? James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I was just asking in your outlook for the third quarter and then kind of what \u2013 the color you're giving for the rest of the year, how much improvement in availability are you building into that? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, no, I think we will improve more in Q4 than we will in Q3. We might see some improvements in the tail end of Q3, but I think we're more likely to see it in the second half of the second half if you will. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Regarding switching, Cisco's reported fairly strong data center orders last quarter, Juniper's released the QFX10000 spine switch. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environments or pricing as a result of this? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The short answer, Steve, is no. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : What's the long answer? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, twice. No, kidding aside, I think I've always said this, Steve, and I'll reiterate that our competitive landscape has always been extremely strong and dynamic. Because it's in such high fury and pace all the time, it's difficult to note any specific change because it's always a constant competitive battle. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, great quarter. I just had a real quick one just in terms of the gross margin comments and all that. So if I were to look out over the next, call it, like, let's call it five quarters, is there a reason why EPS wouldn't essentially track the rate of growth of revenue? So what I mean by that is do you have any levers to grow EPS faster than revenue, or is it going to essentially be in line, just given that gross margins may come down? Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I'm not going to try to go out five quarters at this point, Mitch, honestly, right? I think we've talked about an overall business model in the past, and I'd refer you back to that. And I think we're not going to try to go out that far at this point. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the important thing to remember about Arista is we're still very much in investment mode and we're very much in growth mode, right? So optimizing earnings per share perfectly is a non-go, but obviously we're doing very well in earnings per share growth, so we'll continue to deliver to our shareholders. But if we see investments, we're going to aggressively invest there. And you can see our R&D is still upticking. And we want to be able to do that because we never want to be at a point where we tell our customers, sorry, we're not going to invest in you, because we need to hold on to a certain earnings per share number. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks very much. Well, in the commentary from many of your web scale customers, they started to talk a little bit more, perhaps, than they have in the past about efficiency gains when they're spending on their networks. So I'm wondering if you can help us interpret what that may mean when it comes to how they are working with you, whether it's pricing pressure or more custom products or what have you. That'd be helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a very good question, Jeff. And I think it's deeper than I might answer entirely in this call. I mean one of the things that hasn't been sufficiently appreciated when Arista is with these large cloud titans, is not only do we have a great product, but the level of effort we put into system upgrades, high availability, quality, automation, provisioning, programmability, what many of us call SDN, telemetry, and tools has been what we've been doing not just for one quarter or two quarters but for several years here. Our customers have their own in-house developed tools, but working with them has been a very strong part of our initiatives. And having that control for them is very, very important. So while it may be our product, we'll often work together jointly like it's their technology as well and make sure that their turnkey automation tools and ours can work together. So there's been a number of engagements that are not specific products on our side, but specific aspects of our EOS that work better with them. Now, I've alluded to some of those examples, but we continue to see that as an important differentiator in our partnership with these cloud providers. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: How does that tailor to their efficiency, Jayshree, as opposed to just allowing you to win because you've got a better product than the person down the street? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A good example would be to look at a simple function like Network Rollback. Today, the way you'd do that is you would literally go switch by switch, port by port and issue a command to each one. And you're basically polling and checking the health of every device. By virtue of what we're doing with them, they can automate that process across their entire 100,000 servers or switches. They do some of it and we do some of it. CloudVision is our enterprise turnkey version, but we implement CloudVision-like features with them often with their DevOps tools. So that's a tremendous efficiency in the number of people they need to manage their network, which is a lot fewer. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, we'll take this offline. Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. I'm going to ask one question with several parts. Actually, I'm just kidding. I wanted to get a longer-term question in here. Specifically with the launch of the R-designated products, the routing products, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your aspirations for how much of the market you take and maybe if you could review your go-to-market strategy in that. I think at the initial launch, you talked about targeting the web titans as sort of the first set of customers. If we could get a better understanding of how the go-to-market develops for the routing and then where do you see the trajectory as terms of material contributions to sales and market share in the sector? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. As you know, our primary market is data center switching. This is a $10 billion TAM. We're now this quarter approaching our first $1 billion dollar run-rate and we still see a lot of room in data center switching. So I want to be clear that while we're very enthusiastic on routing that our job is far from done in switching. But routing and switching are coming together. We don't see that they're distinctly different markets in the data center and the core router in the data center is really lacking in dynamic functionality, poor density, programmability pricing, you name it. As I said before, the first customers are likely to be our existing customers and we are already starting to see trials and traction with them. But we're also seeing trials and traction with new service providers, Tier 2 service providers and some of the enterprise customers as well who have traditionally used core routers because we're really providing a destructive price, performance and functionality. So if you ask me how I define success in this, as I've said before, I think 2016 is the year of trials and 2017, 2018 are the year of revenue. I would like to see several tens of customers, maybe even 100 customers this year adopt the R Series and that would be a measure of success. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: If you've already answered any of the following, I apologize in advance, but some very quick ones. What did linearity look like in the quarter? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nice. Pretty good, but we didn't answer that question, so no apology needed. Linearity was good through the quarter. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Well, I'm not done yet, Jayshree. So, pricing? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Paul. You get the prize for sticking to one question. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: No, no, no. I'm not done. Pricing. A sort one, really quick. What did pricing look like? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The pricing was normal and competitive. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Did you have any revenue from routing? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's three questions. That's one too many, Paul. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, but they're one word answers. Any revenue from routing? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. The short and long answer is yes. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. And finally, was the cloud titan revenue growth rate greater than the \u2013 I think I heard you already say this, but was it greater than the rest of your customer base's growth rate as it has been for some time? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our cloud titan contribution in dollars, I won't comment on growth rate till the end of the year, was definitely greater than the other three verticals. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's all. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Paul. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Good afternoon, Ita and Jayshree, and I will try my best to get that one single question award. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Hendi. That's okay, but I don't believe it anymore. But go ahead. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Okay. So the latest Gartner Report said that Arista coverage is still limited outside of North America and Western Europe. I'd like to understand more about the international market. How should we feel about the progression and the timeline and whether use cases in the international market is similar or different than North America and Western Europe? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's an excellent question, Hendi, and you do get the award if you don't ask me a second question for one question. I would say our investment internationally is similar to what we did in the U.S. three years ago to four years ago, but we're just starting. And Mark Foss heads up a lot of our international region. Mark, do you want to add a few words to that? Mark Foss - Senior Vice President, Global Operations & Marketing: Yes, sure. I think what I'd say is in Q2 the EMEA region represented 16% of our total revenue, 9% came from Asia Pacific and 1% came from other Americas. Arista products are actually installed in over 70 countries globally, and we're making good progress with new organic international customer acquisition, although we do benefit from global customer international build-outs. Our regional leadership is working, using a strategy that nears what we did in the U.S. three years ago, but since most of the cloud titans are domestic, we're beginning to have success in the regional web and hosting providers leveraging our land and expand model. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, Jayshree. And I'll take my award. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, thank you. Was there any change in the mix of business in the quarter between new customers and existing customers? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Simona. No particular change. Existing customers certainly drive our contribution, and new customers tend to start out small, so they're always, in dollars, smaller contributors. But no major change. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe just I'll ask it a slightly different way. Has there been any change in the pace of addition of new customers, in particular, since the ITC ruling? Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think I have seen any specific tie to the ITC ruling on new customer acquisition, but I think because our data center purchases tend to be large, we are favoring not just acquiring new customers, but acquiring million dollar customers. So our metric is not just new customers, but big customers. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure, thank you. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Simona. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I wanted to ask about the three selling models that you guys talked to, I think, on last quarter's earnings call. I know that the cloud scale model allows you to sell hardware and software independently. And I think you guys were kind of letting your customers steer you in that regard. But are you seeing sales in that model, where you're separating hardware and software right now? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, George. It's a good question. I think our strategy is definitely ahead of its execution, if that's your question. We have always been prepared to sell software standalone models. But it takes preparation, not just from us, but also from the customer. So I would say, even though we were ready last year, and we've been discussing it a lot this year, we expect to see more execution of it in second half of 2016 and 2017, because there's been a level of preparation required by a customer. But we don't expect \u2013 we have 4,000 customers. We would be very surprised if we saw more than single-digit interest in customers. But they'll be important names. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Chuck Elliott - Director, Product and Investor Advocacy : All right, this concludes the Arista Q2 2016 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted the presentation, which provides additional perspective on our second quarter 2016 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter, ended September 30, 2016. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon on our third quarter 2016 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had another record quarter. Our revenue exceeded a consensus as we grew 33.4% year-over-year to $290.3 million, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew to a record, $0.83. Our new products, the 7500R Series and 7280R Series, as well as our highly differentiated EOS platform, fueled our growth across our top verticals. Services contributed over 12% of our overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 82% of our total revenue, while our international theaters progressed steadily in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.6% in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. In terms of market trends, we have now acquired over 4,100 aggregate customers and have crossed 10 million ports in cumulative shipments since 2008. We are enthusiastic about our market adoption as we increased our market share in the first half of 2016 to 14.9% in 10-Gigabit, 40- Gigabit, 100-Gigabit Ethernet high performance ports according to Crehan market research. In terms of Q3 highlights, Arista unveiled its next generation telemetry, based on EOS and CloudVision. The Arista Telemetry Tracers leverage open source solutions such as HBase and standards such as OpenConfig to capture, stream, store, classify and view real-time actions. Just about every modern customer and architect is looking for analytical methods to efficiently and consistently gain visibility into millions of devices, data and events. Arista's EOS streams the state of network events instantaneously for that real-time visibility into thousands of entities into a Cloud network. In September of 2016, HP Enterprise reinforced its strategic partnership with Arista as the preferred networking vendor at its Worldwide Channel Partner event. We believe this is an important step in a relationship we started a year ago. As we enter the final quarter of 2016, I am quite pleased with our execution in Cloud Networking. It has been a multi-year journey requiring the strong dedication and hard work by our employees and leaders alike. One executive who leads by example in the Arista way is Anshul Sadana. Effective October 2016, Anshul has been promoted to Chief Customer Officer responsible for all customer related functions including worldwide sales, product management, market development, systems engineering, proof of concept and customer advocacy. Many of you may have interacted with him in the investor community, and I'm sure you'll join me in extending our warm wishes and congratulations. Arista's vision and new products are resonating, and they are being actively deployed by our customers. In particular, the Arista Universal Spine and Leaf R-series products have ramped nicely and we expect this momentum to continue into 2017. Arista is clearly in the midst of a tornado Cloud market. This increased demand has, however, created some challenges in our supply side as we are working diligently to address component shortages and ramp our new San Jose, U.S.-based contract manufacturing facility. I couldn't be more excited by our customer acceptance of our software-driven Cloud Networking and deeply appreciate our customers' patience with us as we improve the predictability of our shipments. Now, I will turn it over to Ita for quarterly financials and specifics. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This announcement of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2016 is based on non-GAAP, and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits and the release of a GAAP tax reserve as described below. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q3 were $290.3 million, up 33% year-over-year, and above our guidance of $279 million to $285 million. Overall, the demand in the quarter was strong, not only from our Cloud titan customers, but also across our other key verticals. Service revenues grew with the business, representing 12.4% of revenue consistent with last quarter. International revenues came in at $53 million, or 18% of total revenue, down from 25% last quarter. The reduction in international revenues largely reflects the timing of overseas deployments by our global customers. These deployments tend to be somewhat lumpy and can be significant relative to the overall size of the business in those regions. We remain focused in expanding our international footprint, but you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployments. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.6%, up from last quarter at 64.1%, and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 62% to 65%. This reflected a somewhat more balanced revenue mix across our key verticals, offset by some additional overhead costs associated with ramping our U.S. contract manufacturer and supply chain. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $100 million, up 3% from last quarter. R&D spending returned to a more typical 21.6% of revenue, down from 22.9% last quarter, reflecting some reduction in prototype spending. Sales and marketing expense was consistent at approximately 10.1%, down slightly from last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $87.2 million, or 30% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.1 million and our effective tax rate was 29.7%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $61.2 million, or 21%. The increase in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was primarily related to the shift in geographical revenue mix for the quarter. Our diluted share number for the quarter was $73.5 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share number of $0.83, up 41% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $9 million for the quarter, below our outlook of $11 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. For those of you focusing on our GAAP results, you will notice that our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis came in at 18.5%, down from 26.4% last quarter. This reduced rate benefits from the release of some GAAP tax reserves related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations has now expired. We have excluded this effect from our non-GAAP results in keeping with our view that the non-GAAP numbers should represent ongoing business trends. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $800 million. We used $47.3 million of cash from operations in the September quarter, primarily due to incremental investments in working capital as outlined below. DSOs came in at 67 days, up from 50 days in Q2. This increase primarily reflects a healthy increase in deferred revenues and some shift in linearity in the period. Inventory turns were 2.7 times, down from 3.5 in Q2. Inventory increased to $162.1 million in the quarter, up from $118.1 million in the prior period. This is in line with our outlook on the last call for an overall incremental investment and supply chain related working capital of approximately $100 million. $44 million of this increase is reflected here in the form of finished goods inventory, with a further $62 million as inventory deposits recorded in other assets. Our deferred revenue balance was $284.8 million, up from $230.3 million in Q2. This balance continues to be made up of short- and long-term service contracts and product related deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 68 days, up from 56 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.7 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. We are pleased with our year-to-date financial performance with revenues and earnings per share up more than 35% on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, the demand drivers of the business remain strong, with healthy adoption of our new products across all verticals. We continue to ramp our new contract manufacturer, working to increase volumes on a week-by-week basis. We shipped meaningful revenue from this plant in Q3, and expect to see this contribution increase significantly in the fourth quarter. As previously indicated, we believe gross margins may be negatively impacted by these activities in coming quarters, and could range from 60% to 65% depending on how heavily weighted our revenue mix is towards products manufactured in our new U.S. facility and its associated supply chain. With this as backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows. Revenues of approximately $310 million to $320 million, gross margins of approximately 61% to 64%, operating margin of approximately 26%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29% with diluted shares of approximately $74 million. Please note that based on our current understanding, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $12 million for the quarter. At this time, we would like to open the call up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to get a better handle on the gross margin trends, Ita. If we back into the trends into Q4, it seems like you're at about a 62.5%-ish, and previously I thought that the outlook into that quarter would be towards the lower end of the 60% to 65% range. If we can just get some clarity on what you've done to close the gap there? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no, I think the way to think about it, Stanley, is that we had talked about the 60% to 65% range as a range over time, and the lower end of that range was always going to be in a situation where we were not only manufacturing and shipping from the U.S. contract manufacturer, but also heavily reliant on the supply chain in the U.S. And that was something that's going to happen over time, right? So I think being in the midpoint of that range, that original range in Q4, that's indicative of the fact that we're shipping a lot of product manufactured in the U.S. in the CM, leveraging some supply chain, but we're still also leveraging prior Asian supply chain product as well. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Thanks, and if I can just ask about the supply constraints that were referenced on the prior call, and if sources are correct, throughout the quarter, the supply chain constraints sort of continued. How should we think about that into Q4 and potentially into Q1? When do you expect that to alleviate? And can you help us understand at least in some of the product families what's been going on, more specifically as far as the supply constraints go? Because I think they're affecting the end customers differently. And if I could just squeeze in a quick question on Europe and international, help us understand the disparity in the trends that you're seeing \u2013 potentially more strength in the U.S. than international markets, and how we should think about that? Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay, I'll take a bit of that question, Stan. Basically, you should think of our lead times as having gotten worse between Q2 and Q3, but we have every intention to recover in Q4 and Q1. And our component shortages were across-the-board. They were on our switches. They were on our new products. They were on our cables. They were on our optics. They were shortages in 100 gig. So while we've been working very closely with vendors to improve all of them, component shortages definitely plagued it, combined with the fact that we had unforecasted demand. So that combination definitely did not help. On the other hand, I think we've got \u2013 our VP of Manufacturing and Ita and the whole team has been working very hard. I'm very comfortable that our vendors are working closely with us, and this will improve in Q4 and get better by Q1. In terms of international trends, I think Ita already covered this. Basically, it fluctuates and it's volatile. It's a strong function of not just our organic international performance, which is doing well, but really our Cloud titans and how they expand globally or don't. So they expanded globally very well in our Q2. They did more United States in Q3, and that's reflected in the numbers. But what I would like you to take away is our international theaters' organic growth is just fine. Stanley Kovler - Citi Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. Say, on the constraints, what did the lead times do in the third quarter? And what can you get them down to in Q4? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. If you recall, Erik, I said with you all that the lead times in Q2 were in the range of 4 weeks to 10 weeks, which was already creeping up. We'd like it to be 2 weeks to 8 weeks and 10 weeks is on the high side. And I would say, in general, it shifted by 20%, 25% higher in Q3. So it's probably more like 6 weeks to 12 weeks in Q3. We're looking to definitely bring it down. Depending on the product, some of them will come down in Q4, but we expect all of them will recover nicely in Q1. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : And you said that \u2013 it was that combined with unforecasted demand. What does that mean? Was there areas that you saw \u2013 that you did not anticipate demand that you saw, or what did you see \u2013 what did you mean by that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no, I think we didn't forecast accurately, and forecast is a strong function of two things, right? There's the numbers themselves and then there's the mix, and in both cases, we under-forecasted. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. So will Q4 be benefiting from a fair amount of business slipping from Q3 because of the constraints? Is that how we can interpret the Q4 outlook? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I think the way to look at Q4 is \u2013 and in fact, as you notice, Ita gave a wider range. On one hand, I think we will release some of the component shortages. On the other hand, we won't recover entirely in terms of lead times because many of the components have much longer lead times than our products do. If you may recall, I shared with you that some of them have 16 week to 22 week lead times. So while we will recover on some components, we won't recover on all products and all components. So this will be a multi-quarter process. It will take us Q4 and Q1 to recover. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : And that's not necessarily just a function of you moving your manufacturing, is it? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, so that's the component shortage. That combined with the fact that Q4 is our full first quarter of U.S. manufacturing is why we've got a lot of execution ahead of us. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: But at the same time, Erik, we're shipping record quarters, right? But we are seeing incremental shipments and incremental demand. Obviously, we're responding to those as fast as we can while we're bringing up the U.S. manufacturing. So that's definitely a factor but there's also the fact that we are shipping volumes now. We've been growing 30%, in excess of 30% year-over-year all through the year. So that volume is growing as well at the same time. So it's a combination of both, right? Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. I just want to follow-up on kind of the shortages question. And I'm just wondering, how confident are you right now that you're being able to scrub your orders and forecasts to take into account potentially any double ordering? How much double ordering do you think is taking place, I guess, is a more direct way to ask. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, James. We're very confident that there's very little or no double ordering because our customer intimacy is very high. This is not just happening at the channels. We know every single order is on new products that we're working closely with on their migrations, so we're comfortable that the customer is ordering for their demand and we're fulfilling for that. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then turning to the HPE relationship, can you talk a little bit about how you expect that to develop? I know, maybe from what it was to how you would envision that operating going forward and I guess a small accounting question associated with that, will there be any channel fill or other changes in the way that you ship and recognize associated with the HP relationship? Thanks a lot. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, James. First of all, I think I speak on behalf of Anshul, Mark Smith, Ita, myself, everyone, that we're all very excited about the HP Enterprise relationship. It's not a brand new one for us. We've had a chance to date and get to know each other this last year really well. From Meg Whitman to Antonio, all the way at the top, what we're seeing is that there are a number of partnership possibilities. We started out with the Converged Infrastructure and that's clearly one that Arista hasn't been participating alone on. You've heard me talk about the three markets : the Cloud scale, which is our cousin; the Cloud class, which is our four verticals, and then the Cloud converge. The Cloud converge is a very natural synergy with HPE and especially with their compute and storage platforms. So with HP's reinforcement, that's really going to help in a tier of enterprise that Arista has not typically been in. The second thing I would say is, I think HP's realization and partnership that we are the preferred vendor on the datacenter side, and obviously, they have a great deal of depth and assets on the Aruba and Campus side makes it very complementary. So we see a lot of excitement. The agreement itself is actually officially getting signed next week, November 7. So right now, we have the enthusiasm and we look forward in 2017 to convert that into real partnership and real wins. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: And James, it doesn't drive any different accounting on our side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Jeff? Operator : Jeff Kvaal, your line is open. You may be on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. A couple of quick ones, if I may. Jayshree, can you give us any update on the Cloud side in hyperscale as a percent of revenue, or their growth relative to the rest of the customer base? Also, any more granular insight you can offer on the 7500R and the 7280R platforms in terms of the uptake, either from a customer quantification standpoint where I trust the revenue contribution is still small, but anything that would speak to the way they're being ramped? And I hate to ask you again on the component tightness, but Ita would it be possible to \u2013 have you quantified the impacts on Q3, as well as how much more revenue you think you would have been able to do in Q4, but for the component tightness? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Three part question. Hi, Paul. Thank you. So on the Cloud titan's, they continue to be very strong for us and the mix is very similar to prior quarters and important for you to understand it isn't one Cloud titan, but many of them. So we're quite pleased with their acceptance of our products and our relationship with them. But no change in momentum and mix, it's still very strong and growing well. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Jayshree, is it still around 25% of revenue or is it greater than that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I have never mentioned percentages, and as you know, so I won't comment on agreeing or disagreeing with that. But I'll tell you, it's as good as it was in the prior quarters. So going back to the R question, which is our new products, as I told you guys, I was expecting single-digit customers in Q2, which was the first real quarter of shipment for our brand new products. And what's nice is I think we've doubled from Q2 to Q3 in the number of customers in routing, and I'm still going to challenge the team to do 100 customers in a year. So by next Q2, I'd like to be at 100 customers in routing. But both the 7500R and 7280R as new products is ramping very well \u2013 very, very well. Very rapid qualification and ramp, both as a switch and in terms of routing, and again, I think we're hitting our targets and exceeding them. And let's see, what was your last question? Your last question was quantify? You have something to quantify? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I don't know how to quantify it. I will tell you, we're working very closely with customers. We obviously had a record ship quarter in the quarter. And really this is more \u2013 we're facing a lot of activity and we're working with customers to figure out how to slot in their demands. So it's very difficult to say, okay was there something that was removed from one quarter to the other? It's more that there's good strong activity and we're working with customers to figure out how to fulfill that. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think... Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: What... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Go ahead. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. No, go ahead, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Paul, I was going to add to Ita that one of the things we're doing, is it's not so that we ship or we don't ship. A lot of times we work with the customer to figure out what's their priority and ship partials as well. So some of them will get shipped in one quarter. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: But clearly there was some revenue. Clearly revenue would have been greater, I assume for Q3 as well as for Q4, but for the component tightness. And if I may, while I'm at it, any change in the pricing environment? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So in terms of, clearly revenue would be greater. I'm not one to speculate on the past. I'm going to focus on the present and the future. Don't know, Paul. But, what was your question? Pricing? No, we didn't feel any different pricing pressure than we always do. In our market the pricing pressure by definition is high and it continues to be competitive, but nothing unique in Q3. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc: Good afternoon Jayshree, Ita and Chuck. First, congrats on your achievement on winning almost 15% market share. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you Hendi. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc: Jayshree, I think you alluded to this. Would you be able to quantify some estimate of the impact of the component shortage to your sales? I don't know whether you're willing to share that or not. If not, one additional question is, do component shortages occur more in the United States versus international markets since you're ramping up your U.S. facility? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No. So to answer the second question, I'm not able to quantify any more than I'm sharing with you, which is our lead times moved and our shortages are not unique to one product; they were across the board. But no, they did not just apply to the United States. In Q3, we were shipping with standard contract manufacturing, until our borders closed, till August 23. So almost half the quarter we had the flexibility of all our contract manufacturers, right? So our component shortages were tied to all our contract manufacturers. They weren't unique to international only. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Congrats on another nice quarter. A couple of questions as well. Just first on the 7000 products. I was hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more color with respect to the interest you're seeing on the routing side? If it's beyond the Cloud vertical, how you see that progressing over the next few quarters? And to what degree Jericho or incremental software features are the gating factors at moment? And then on the inventory side, it didn't increase sequentially as much as I would have expected. So I guess I was hoping you could comment to what degree you feel you can meet your needs this quarter with internationally-sourced supply? Do you think you need to leverage the U.S. supply chain more heavily? And if we don't hear something from U.S. Customs by the end of this quarter, to what extent are there ways for you to get components that aren't manufactured in the U.S.? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so maybe I'll take that first. I mean, so inventory, we had said we'd grow kind of inventory and working capital total around this for about $100 million. If you look at what we actually did, we grew inventory for $40 million plus and then we grew component inventory. It's just showing up differently in the financials by a further $60 million plus. So we achieved about $107 million of incremental, finished goods and component inventory in the quarter, which was pretty much in line with what we had planned to do, right? We've always \u2013 so as you look at what's been happening, we've been executing pretty well to the plan, right? We saw the contract manufacturer contribute meaningful revenue in Q3, and they're ramping in Q4, right? So I think more and more of the volume will come from that U.S. plant in Q4, and that's always been part of the plan. As we go beyond that, we still have components that we'll consume, and then we have plans for what happens beyond that, right? And we'll execute on those as we go. But really, there's nothing happening that's different from what we expected and what was in line with our original plans. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is it fair to assume that... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah \u2013 go ahead. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...is that you can get components that aren't necessarily directly manufactured in the U.S. through a third-party or some other source? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I'm not going to try to go component-by-component or what those plans are, but we've been thinking about this for a long time and we've laid out plans for the various components and needs. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And so to answer your question, Jess, on the routing, I'm pleasantly surprised by the acceptance of our routing platforms faster than I expected. I don't think there will be material revenue till next year and year after. But as you know, Arista's target is not the legacy router kind of customers that deploy SONET/SDH or traffic engineering and incumbency. Most of those service provider and enterprise customers are transforming from traffic engineering to a more Cloud-like datacenter interconnect and leaf-spine architecture with software-based automation, routing and telemetry. So, our customer count is increasing, and it's going beyond the classical Cloud titans. As I've said, we've gone from single-digit customer acquisition in routing in Q2 to double-digit in Q3, and I think we'll continue to see more customers in Q4, Q1 and 2017. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jess. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the really strong execution here, Jayshree. Just to clarify in Q4 around the U.S. manufacturing, is it a good assumption that most of your U.S. customers will be supplied from U.S. manufacturing this quarter? Or is there still some international products and inventory that can be used? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: There's some mix there, but we're weighting more heavily towards the U.S manufacturing in Q4. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a good assumption that the majority of our supply will come from U.S. manufacturing. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. And my last question, Jayshree, inside your top accounts, how are you \u2013 assuming that the lead times stay where they are that you saw in Q3, how do you prioritize across different accounts and within accounts to make sure that you don't lose market share with really critical customers? How are you making those decisions right now? Or maybe those decisions that you've had to make haven't really materialized yet? If you could short of comment on where you're making your bets with the inventory? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, actually thank you for that question, and thank you for the good wishes. I feel like my CEO title right now stands for Chief Expedite Officer, and so I'm prioritizing all my top customers very, very highly. And it isn't easy when you don't have the parts to give all of them all they want. But I think because of the nature of the relationship my team and I have with these customers, they have put themselves in our shoes and feel our pain and we feel theirs, and we're doing the best we can to A, prioritize based on the mission criticality of their project; B, prioritize based on when they put in the order. So first in, first out is a fair mechanism from our perspective. And as I said earlier, also where we cannot prioritize and ship everything, we've worked with them on partials. So those are the three primary mechanisms. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, if I could. I want to understand more about the kind of the growth factors you're seeing within cloud in terms of public cloud versus private cloud. There's been some mixed trend lines that we've come across in my research related to public cloud versus private cloud adoption. While private cloud adoption seems to be content in air pockets. Are you seeing that in your business? And then the second question is around routing, following up on some prior questions. Can you talk about how we should think about the longer term sales motion there? Is there going to be greater R&D required, sales and marketing required, as you begin to penetrate more sophisticated Telco providers with their newer rollouts? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so let me take the two questions. First, public versus private. I think there's no doubt in anybody's mind that the public cloud has already arrived. We're seeing a lot of workloads moving there. And just to put this in context, even two years ago, there wasn't as much scale and expansion in the public cloud as there is today. Just about every major Cloud titan is making investments in that, the seven we state and others. Now, in terms of public cloud, the one other thing I'd want to say is there's the Cloud titans, but there's a number of companies we're working with that I would say are not quite the scale of the titans but are also building public clouds. And they're very, very promising, and we're working closely with them. And there may be an instance of private cloud or public cloud, but I see a whole other tier, a second tier of cloud providers who are so promising, some of them may well make it into the titans in the next year or two. So that's another thing to consider, that the workloads are moving rapidly, and our product and our capabilities are beginning to become interested not just with the top titans but the next tier as well. In terms of private cloud, this is an area we've been focusing on with our other verticals, (37:08) high-tech enterprise and financials. And what I would tell you there is they very much emulate the practices of the public cloud, but obviously the scale of it is much, much smaller. And this is something we have been working on, and it tends to be on a project basis whether it's compute or storage or security. And a lot of the datacenters in the public \u2013 in the private enterprise on-prem are starting to look more and more like the public cloud. In terms of R&D for routing, it's an area we've invested in pretty significantly. We didn't just start now. We have been on it for last couple of years, and we continue to see that as an important thrust. We continue to believe that we lead with high R&D as a percentage of revenue, and that'll be a metric that's \u2013 a metric of important investment for us. So both switching and routing are factored in that R&D, and definitely we are increasing our investment in routing protocols. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: But all still within kind of that 20% to 22% of revenue that we talked about, right? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Exactly. So within the business model we have. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Mark (38:19). Operator : Thank you, your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Hi, Jayshree, Ita. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Jayshree. The question and a quick follow on. Any update on timing on Customs approval for the software workarounds that you have submitted? And would you anticipate any delays in this workaround approvals? And then, Jayshree, quickly, any concerns on potential share loss to Cisco in the near term, if customers would see higher lead times for their purchase orders? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So on the Customs, maybe Ita wants to add to that, but we've always said that the typical cycles for Customs approval can be anywhere from two months to a year. And so we don't have much else to add. We don't have an update. When we do get an update, we'll share that with you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean there's really nothing new, Vijay, and we probably wouldn't expect to see anything new at this point, yeah, right. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And in terms of share loss, we still talk about share gain, not share loss, so I hope that's our trend. And we will do everything to continue to gain share. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right, Jayshree. I've got 16 more questions on supply constraints. Okay. Let's see. So I just wanted to step back a second here and look and think about next year, specifically Q1, given these supply constraints and the manufacturing transition. And how should we think about seasonality? Will it be down greater than Q1 of 2016? Any sort of broad strokes, just so we have the right starting point as we think about 2017 and we don't get ahead of our skis? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so I think you should separate demand from our short-term shortages. So you should think of Q1 as always seasonably flat to down, like it's been the last few years. And even if we were to get ahead and increase our demand and fulfill it and get over all our shortages, that's not going to take care of the fact that usually six weeks out of the quarter in Q1, there's not a lot of customer interaction and engagement. So separate those two issues. We'll work on shortages, but seasonality is what it is in Q1. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So something similar to what we've seen in 2016, I guess? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I think so, 2016, 2015, 2014, we've got like five years to spend on this. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Okay and then just finally, maybe just some quick comments on Anshul and the promotion there. What does that mean for Arista and what does it allow you to do? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: It allows me to sit back and tell others what to do. Just kidding. But first of all, I think Mark Smith and his team have done a fantastic job and this is truly a recognition of an individual, Anshul, who has teamed with Mark, teamed with the product management, teamed with the engineers, and personally, also run systems engineering and customer advocacy for nine years in the company. And really, says what he does and does what he says the Arista way. So it's a recognition of Anshul. And as you know, there's a lot of customer-facing functions that need strategic thought. It needs depth in technology and it needs unification. So I think what you're really seeing here is the acknowledgment and promotion of a fantastic individual who deserves it, earned it and is going to be very much the future of Arista. Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered but I just want to clarify one thing. The mix between U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing that you're assuming in Q4 that's embedded in your gross margin guidance. Is that going to continue to change more towards the U.S. going forward for the foreseeable and then into next year? So could there be more step downs in gross margin or is this roughly where you're going to be at the midpoint? That's first. And the second question I had was with respect to the routing product. So my understanding always was it would be \u2013 it would become material in terms of revenue into 2017, but then Jayshree mentioned just as \u2013 you want to get to 100 customers by Q2. Are those two the same statements in essence? Just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. So to go back to gross margin, Kulbinder, I think what we've always said is that the manufacturing in the U.S. in of itself is not the biggest driver of gross margin, right? So we are migrating to being more heavily dependent on the U.S. manufacturer and that was always the plan in Q4,. And you're seeing some impact of that in the gross margin guidance in Q4. For it to go beyond \u2013 go below that, then we would have to have a protracted period of time where we can't import components and we start to leverage the U.S. supply chain more and more, and that's when we would see something like the 60% in the lower end of that range. So I can't tell you exactly what's going to happen here because there's obviously some unknowns, but I think that's the framework to think about it, is if we become more and more U.S. supply chain dependent, then that's when we would hit the bottom end of that range. If we're manufacturing but still leveraging other components, then something similar to what you're seeing in Q4. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Ita. And Kulbinder, to answer your routing question, I think the materiality of revenue will take time. It will be second half 2017 or 2018, but the acquisition of customers is a great starting point. As we can qualify our platform to not just be the world's best spine switch, but also enable routing capabilities, this will get customers very comfortable in making this shift, if you will, from a router versus routing. It is different. We're doing VXLAN routing, segment routing, MPLS-lite without all the traditional traffic engineering, leaf-spine architecture. So there's a lot to trial and think about and that's why the first metric for me is winning the customers and their hearts and minds. And then the next material revenue metric would come later. It's also going to be challenging to measure the revenue metric because sometimes we won't know if they're using it as a switch or a routing platform or both, and so in many cases, it maybe a combination of both. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I've got a couple of questions, actually. I wanted to go back to the HPE agreement and just talk a little bit. We understand that all the channel deals have been done there, which is great news for you guys, but how are you going to prioritize channel fill there? Jayshree, are you going even be populate the channel or is there overlap and you've already got inventory out there in the channel that they can start selling? So I'm just curious how that's going to work or if they just have to wait until some of these other customers get served? And then also wanted to ask about greenfield datacenter builds. We understand some of those are pushing out into early next year, that a lot of us had thought would complete the end of this year \u2013 at least be ramping. And I wonder if you guys have exposure to that? Do you see that happening or is that really not customers you're involved with? And then lastly, I guess on this U.S. manufacturing, are we at pretty much a 100% impact at the end of Q4? Or when \u2013 can you just update us on when that impact you think is maximized so that we kind of know what to think about on gross margins, when we think those gross margins will stabilize? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, again, just to take maybe the gross margin one first, right? Again, it depends how things evolve, right? Obviously, we're waiting for \u2013 some Customs update, et cetera, as we go through this cycle. Pure manufacturing in the U.S., like we said, is not a huge drag on the gross margin. To hit the lower end of the range that we've talked about, we would have to be in a position where we would be leveraging the U.S. supply chain heavily, right? And that would happen obviously with more time as we have to develop some of those supply chain activities. So I think where we're manufacturing and still using Asian supply chain, you're in kind of the range that we see in Q4. As time goes on, and we don't get access to Asian components, we'll become more and more dependent on U.S. components and that's when you would see the lower end that range. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : When would that happen, Ita? Can you just help us understand, like let's say worst case scenario you didn't get Customs approval? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. It varies by component, Rod. It's very hard to try to put some timing on that. I think what we've tried to do is at least put book-ins on the range, and then we'll update as we go \u2013 when we know more. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So, Rod, to answer your two questions on HPE distribution. Our agreement is really a resell agreement and any bundling with channels and partners, HPE will be leading with. We'll supply the networking component and they will pile on the converged components, which is the compute and the storage and sometimes the OneView integration with CloudVision. So we're very comfortable that they're owning the channel and the converged piece and we're supplying the building block, which is networking. So no issues there on this. It's really a resell agreement, not a distribution. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But do you have to \u2013 Jayshree, don't you have to give them some inventory to be able to sell it or that's just not the case? You just ship as they need it? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean, if they do need inventory to sell it, we will. But in many cases, it may be a drop ship directly to the customer and we verify it in the rack over there at the customer property; so it will vary. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Can you repeat your datacenter greenfield question? I didn't follow it. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : There's some instant (48:52) data points through the earnings season here suggesting that there's some big greenfield builds going on, as you guys know. And there've been a number of data points suggesting those are pushing even further out into the beginning of next year than people had expected, for various reasons \u2013 a lot of them to do with component shortages. So just curious if you guys have seen that same kind of thing from your point of view or are these people that are not particularly customers of yours? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And by the way, when I talk about component shortages there, I'm not talking about your specific component shortages, but rather, industry-wide shortages. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no. I got it. Yeah. So to answer your question \u2013 let me take it a little broadly and I think I know who the customers are you're talking about. But broadly speaking, when you hear a cloud company (49:56) talking about their massive hundreds of millions of dollars of spend, you know it includes building facilities, power, compute, virtualization, storage. The networking is a small percentage of it, so while we are really influenced by their spend, their spend can continue with us, independent of the volatility in their overall spend, because we're a small number. So we're pretty comfortable that the networking spend has a long road ahead, and we're feeling quite good about Q4 here based on our guidance, and next year. So no, I don't think even if datacenter greenfield opportunities have shifted, that they are affecting us in any negative fashion at this time. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Victor in for Simon. I wanted to ask if any customers have expressed concern, I guess, regarding the increased lead times? And I guess more importantly, are you observing any hesitation from customers committing to purchases, given the uncertainty around the outstanding litigation issues with Cisco? And if not, I guess, what's giving customers confidence that they'll have support for their purchases over the longer term? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So I'll take \u2013 the short answer is we \u2013 customers do express concern on our longer lead times. There's no doubt about that, and they wish they were shorter, and they wish we would go back to our predictable on-time shipments. Our on-time shipments is virtually 100%, and now it's much less than that. In terms of litigation, no change. Our customers do want to know that we stand by our workarounds, and that we're legally compliant. And Marc Taxay, our General Counsel, who has shared with you many, many times, as we have, we are completely committed to and are following the law. And so our customers take the time to understand that and get through the flood of our competitors and some ask questions, some have deeper questions, and some are not worried at all and recognize this as a protection of the competitors' behavior. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Victor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. You had previously alluded to 100-gig uptake constrained by the availability of optics. Is that now resolved? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, it's not fully resolved. We hope it will be in Q4 or Q1. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I was curious if you can give us any sense... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And just \u2013 sorry, Steve, just to put that in context, these 100-gigabit optic shortages are not unique to Arista. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : No. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: They're industry wide. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Yep, understood. Can you give us any sense of kind of how much business you do at the Spine versus the Leaf level, and if that's going to continue to shift to the Spine? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We've not been expressedly specific, but we've generally said that the Leaf can be \u2013 yeah, it generally can be \u2013 the Leaf and the Spine are almost split 50%/50%, if you don't include the accessories or if you put these optics and accessories more associated with 100-gig with the spine. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : And that's across all your verticals, or specifically the Cloud? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Across \u2013 I gave you a general, but they don't vary too much across the verticals. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Probably more Spine-centric in the Cloud vertical. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one clarifying one. I hate to go back to the topic of the gross margin, but \u2013 so if we look at Q4 guide, it looks like 61% to 64% which makes sense, because you have some more U.S. inventory coming in, but wouldn't that be the case for Q1 as well in the following year, since all the items are now being manufactured in the U.S.? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so again I think we had put out the range of 60% to 65%, and I think everybody kind of settled in at the midpoint of that range, and that's a good place to be when we're leveraging the manufacturing plans and we've got a mix of component and supply chain between Asia and the U.S., right? And we'll see \u2013 that's how it should be for the foreseeable future. If it's protracted and we end up becoming more dependent on the U.S., then I think that's when we would see kind of below that into the 60%ish range that we have put as the bottom metric, right? So I think in an environment where we're manufacturing in the U.S. and where we've got mixed supply chain, the Q4 guide is pretty representative of that. If we become more heavily dependent on the U.S. over time, then that's when you would see it go below that. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mitch. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you. I had a question for Ita and then one for Jayshree as well. Ita, the day sales were quite high. So just curious why the quarter was so back-end loaded? And then there was also really significant increase in current deferred revenues, so just curious what's behind that as well? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so they're somewhat linked, right? The DSO calc reflects the fact that there was growth in deferred revenue. There was healthy growth in deferred revenue in the quarter. The deferred revenue portion of that is based on acceptances and if we are \u2013 saw linearity that favors the back end of the quarter, then that will grow, and we did see some of that, right? So it's a combination of some shift in linearity a little bit, and also, the fact that the deferred revenue grew and I don't see that kind of corrupt the DSO calc a little bit because it's not included in the denominator. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But what drove that shift in linearity? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Again I think we've been \u2013 we're seeing increasing demand as we went through the quarter and we were responding to the demand and that's just how the shipments happened. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then Jayshree, any thoughts on the implications of Broadcom's acquisition of Brocade and the intended sale of the IP networking business? And then on another M&A topic, we've seen some of your competitors acquire optical component businesses, so just curious if that would be of interest for you guys, not just because of the shortages near term, but also just considering that optical components keep increasing as a percent of the overall system? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So no, I think the Broadcom-Brocade announcement is a very interesting and intriguing one. It shows that the industry is consolidating. And it also shows that the SAN market, fiber channel market has been very sticky, but not growing at all and one that really reflects more of a chipset and OEM business than a system business. So I applaud Broadcom for thinking about it strategically. I also applaud them for not competing with their customers and realizing that the IP networking business is not their core goal here, and they are likely to spin it off. Nobody wants to compete with their customers. So I look at that acquisition quite favorably, and obviously, like all M&As, execution is important and we would be looking to see how they do that. In terms of optics, I couldn't agree with you more, Simona. I think the whole datacenter connect and the integration of layer one, layer two, layer three, optics, particularly for 100-gig, where the optics can get very expensive, very much happening. Our point of view on this, along with Andy's is, we would like to see standardization of connectors and we would like to see more diversity of supply rather than shortages. We would like to see more vendors there. I'm not sure I want to lock myself in with one optics vendor. I would like to see five or 10 of them. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks Simona. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, can you all hear me okay? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: This time we can, Jeff. We missed you last time. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I was here. I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. Okay, could I broaden on that last question about Brocade and could you tell us a little bit more about the competitive landscape? Are the Brocade products any good if they find the right home? Are they going to be more of a competitive threat? We hear a lot about Juniper's new QFX10000. Are you running into that? Help us along those lines. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, look. This market is $6 billion or $7 billion TAM, and every competitor has their strength and weakness. I think Juniper is a very good company for service provider routing. I think Brocade is a very good SAN switching company. I think Cisco is a very good enterprise company. And I think Arista is the best ever Cloud Networking company you saw. So, you look at the market share for these vendors and it reflects that, and you can see here that Brocade's been around 2% to 3% in IP networking. That is not sustainable in terms of position. I think you have to be number one or number two to be a strong leader. And I think this was a good outcome for Brocade because of that. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And then my second question is 2015 was not actually that super of a year for datacenter CapEx, and I'm wondering if \u2013 well, there's a lot of digestion underway in 2015 according to Google. 2016 has been a lot better, the CapEx is up a lot. What does the magic crystal ball tell us about 2017? Should we worry about another period of digestion after a strong 2016? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no, I think you'll always see certain companies go through digestion, but if I sort of even out the highs and the lows, we see 2017 as being a good year of Cloud CapEx. Some may buy less and some may buy more, and a lot of that I think becomes sort of a long-term building and capital investment, less about networking. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dariush Pirmin Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America : Hey, guys. This is Dariush on for Tal. Thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask a question about components somewhat differently. Clearly, you've built up component inventory from overseas ahead of the import ban, and now you're shifting to your U.S. supply chain, you're seeing longer lead times. So my question is how long would it take to draw down versus all of your component inventories from overseas? And do you see a scenario where component shortages in your U.S. supply chain could impact revenues as you draw down your overseas component inventories? Just looking at differences in lead times between components and your product lead times implies that this should happen at some point. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, again, like I said earlier, we've been thinking about this problem for a long time, and we've laid out plans across the different components. And we're not going to get into those in tremendous detail here. Dariush Pirmin Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America : Okay. And do you guys use the first in, first out method, or last in, first out for...? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: FIFO. Yeah, FIFO. Dariush Pirmin Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America : FIFO, okay. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Dariush Pirmin Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America : Thanks, and then just a quick last question from me. What was customer count in the quarter? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Over 4,100. Dariush Pirmin Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America : 4,100. Great. Thanks, guys. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q3 2016 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional perspective on our third quarter 2016 fiscal results, which you can access in the Investors section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer; as well as Marc Taxay, Arista's Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and Anshul Sadana, Arista's Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings Call. I am pleased to report that we had another record quarter and 2016 has definitely been a year to remember, with key inflection points as Arista surpassed the $1 billion annual sales mark. Our profitable Q4 2016 growth is demonstrated in non-GAAP revenue of $328 million as we grew 33.6% year-over-year while non-GAAP earnings per share grew to a record $1.04. Services contributed approximately 12% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 77% of total revenue, while the rest of the international theaters progressed well in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 64.4% in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. As of December 2016, we have now acquired over 4,250 customers over the cumulative years. Starting 2016 (sic) [2017], we expect to report this statistic annually. In terms of new products, Arista unveiled its next programmable leaf switch called the 7160 Series. The Arista 7160 is the first switch based on Cavium's XPliant silicon with a sweet spot particularly for 25 gigabit Ethernet and it's the first offering based on Arista's new AlgoMatch innovation. It combines general purpose memory with advanced packet matching algorithm. Unlike generic implementations, AlgoMatch delivers higher flexibility, improved power, and lower costs with dedicated ternary content addressable memories. Examples of these use cases include IPv4 to IPv6 migration in cloud networks, precision-based classification where AlgoMatch can offer sourcing improvements over traditional TCAMs and action specific matching for flexibility such as protocol matching, Layer 4 filtering or deep packet inspections at wire speed. Arista will provide a legal update since 2016 marks the completion of two years since Cisco Systems filed its assault of lawsuits. Despite having to weather the many baseless accusations, we at Arista have demonstrated through our actions and our results. We will continue to uphold our dignity, integrity and adhere to the law the Arista way. Clearly, we're dealing here with a powerful competitor with enormous clout, deep financial pockets and even political lobbying capabilities often misrepresenting our intentions. So let me take a moment to quickly review the facts. To date, Arista has prevailed or obtained favorable Administrative Law Judge, ALJ, decisions on nine out of 14 asserted patents in ITC and district court. Four of the five remaining patents primarily cover commonly standard implemented networking features used across the switching industry such as private VLANs, access list and CoPP. On December 14, 2016, Arista received a favorable jury verdict on Cisco's Command-Line Interface copyright claims. We consider this an important moral and legal victory not only for Arista but the broader industry to have that standard networking language of communication. Regarding customs, late evening on Friday, January 13, 2017, we were surprised to receive a letter from Customs and Border Protection, CBP, that revoked its previously issued 177 ruling on November 18, 2016. It is important to emphasize that CBP has not ruled that Arista's products infringe. CBP currently have no stated position on that issue. Instead, CBP has set up a process to obtain input from both parties before issuing a new ruling. We do look forward to cooperating with customs in forthcoming weeks. We are in inter-party process to resolve the matter. Arista is firmly resolute and steadfast in lawful supply of our products and servicing them without disruption to our customers. As a reminder, the ITC and customs orders do not prohibit us from selling non-infringing products manufactured in the domestic USA. Speaking of manufacturing, you may remember I spent a lot of time on this topic last quarter. Arista has also made significant strides in global and U.S. supply chain to respond to the increased forecast we experienced in the second half of 2016. Lead times and the predictability of our shipments have been improving and I expect them to be restored by Q1 2017 for our mainstream products as I stated in our prior earnings call. Now I would like to highlight some of the key 2016 events. In 2016, we established ourselves as one of the fastest growing networking companies in recent times. We focused on being both a growth company and generating profits. This way we continue to invest in R&D innovation and support functions, growing our employee head count from 1,200 in 2015 to approximately 1,500 employees in 2016. We also demonstrated a rich suite of new products and capabilities in 2016 led by the R Series Universal Leaf and Spine and our highly-differentiated EOS based on network-wide state-driven NetDB and CloudVision automation and analytics. We have been delighted by the customers' adoption that fueled across all our top verticals. Our top 10 customers included cloud titans, cloud and service providers, as well as financial services in 2016. Microsoft was our top and only 10% concentration customer at 16% of overall 2016 revenue, up from 12% in 2015. In conclusion, as we enter 2017, I am really thankful to Arista customers, partners, employees, shareholders and our board of directors for their dedication and support to us. Arista is clearly outpacing the cloud market and movement. For the first time in perhaps over two decades, a compelling alternative has emerged to the stagnant IT incumbency. I couldn't be more proud and more pleased with Arista's contributions to this unstoppable cloud migration. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for quarterly and 2016 financials. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2016 results and our guidance for Q1 2017 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock based compensation expenses, legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits and the release of GAAP tax reserves as described previously. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q4 were $328 million, up 33.6% year-over-year and above our guidance of $310 million to $320 million. Demand in the quarter remained strong, reflecting continued broad-based adoption of our products. Services revenues represented approximately 12% of revenues, in line with prior quarters. International revenues came in at $74.3 million or 23% of total revenue, up from 18% last quarter. This is more in line with our typical quarterly revenue mix and reflects strong growth in the international business on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain focused on expanding our international footprint, but you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployments. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 64.4%, down slightly from last quarter at 64.6% and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 61% to 64%. This improvement versus guidance reflected a more balanced supply chain in the quarter, leveraging both U.S. and international supply sources. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $105 million, up 4.9% from last quarter, providing significant leverage on a 13% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rate. R&D spending on a dollar basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, reflecting continued growth in head count, offset by a once-off reduction in spending on prototypes and NREs. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $34 million or 10.4% of revenues, reflecting typical fourth quarter sales compensation trends. Our operating income for the quarter was $106 million or 32.3% of revenue. Other expense for the quarter was $0.4 million, and our effective tax rate was 26.7%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $77.5 million or 23.6%. The reduction in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was primarily related to a shift in geographical revenue mix in the quarter. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 74.4 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $1.04, up 30% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $12.2 million for the quarter, in line with our outlook of $12 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $868 million. We generated $52.8 million of cash from operations in the December quarter. This reflects strong net income performance combined with significant growth in product related deferred revenue, offset by continued investments in supply chain working capital. DSOs came in at 71 days, up from 67 days in Q3. This increase primarily reflects an increase in our deferred revenue balance for the quarter. Inventory turns were 2.2 times, down from 2.7 times in Q3. Inventory increased to $236.5 million in the quarter, up from $162.1 million in the prior period. This reflects growth at both the raw materials and finished goods level and is in line with our strategy of continuing to invest in supply chain related working capital where appropriate. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $60 million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets at the end of the quarter. Our deferred revenue balance was $372.9 million, up from $284.8 million in Q3. This balance continues to be made up of short and long-term service contracts and product-related deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 62 days, down from 68 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory payments and receipts. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.9 million. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond, we are pleased with the strong execution underlying our 2016 financial performance with revenues and earnings per share up 35% on a year-over-year basis. Looking forward to 2017, we believe that the demand drivers of the business remain strong with healthy growth in cloud networking and broad-based adoption of our new products. Operationally, we've continued to ramp volumes at our U.S. contract manufacturer in order to have the flexibility of supporting U.S. customer demand from that site. In addition, we have and will continue to make investments in our U.S.-based supply chain, driving both availability and cost structure improvements. Based on our current understanding, we would reiterate the gross margin outlook we had previously provided of 60% to 65%. Where we operate within this range in any given quarter will be driven by two key factors : customer mix and our level of dependence on U.S. sourcing. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits is as follows : revenues of approximately $320 million to $330 million, gross margin of approximately 61% to 64%, operating margin of approximately 27%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29% with diluted shares of approximately 74.9 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuit to be approximately $12 million for the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due do time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thanks, all. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Ita, could you give us a sense of where you are on the components side? You had two months to be able to import components before things were reversed. Were you able to sort of accelerate the rate at which you did that? Do you have sufficient components for the next few months? And you did mention lead times should be coming in so that suggests there shouldn't be kind of any unusual issues going forward and yet you're still suggesting a fairly wide gross margin range. So, maybe you can just kind of update us in terms of where you are in component availability. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Steve, I think if you listened to what we said in our prepared remarks, right, I mean obviously, we continued to ramp our contract manufacturing in U.S. sourcing since the last time we talked. And that's going be the key to supporting customers in the U.S. and ensuring that we're able to support customers in the U.S. We did grow some inventory numbers. You saw that in the year-end balance sheet so there is some flexibility there. But ultimately we're building a supply chain that will support the business from the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kurtz from Pacific Crest Securities. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Yeah, thanks, guys. Can you hear me okay? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yep. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : So Jayshree, maybe you could just give us a view into the cloud titans and their spending patterns in sort of what the white-box switching has done to their infrastructure. And maybe all those white-box ports are creating incremental opportunities for your aggregation switches. So maybe can you take us into Q4 and how that looked and maybe versus Q4 a year ago? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure, Alex. And, Anshul, maybe you want to add to what I say. We have not seen a significant change in cloud titans' behavior in spending with us, both at the Leaf and Spine. But as we've often pointed out with our titans, it isn't just one Leaf or one Spine. There are many tiers of both. And when you look at the white box, more of that is just a single use case in a Tier 0 leaf that most of which is still in very early stages and not in production. So, we're seeing healthy demand from all our cloud titans on the Leaf and the Spine and for that matter also on datacenter interconnect spines for routing and optical. So between 2015 and 2016, I would say the biggest change is greater reception of our new R Series products, greater reception and deployment of 100 gig in the Spine, but otherwise spending patterns and buying patterns have not significantly changed. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure Jayshree. Alex, if you look at the discussion on white boxes, it comes down to, for the cloud titans, the ability to customize and control the network. With EOS, the programmability, and the integration work we do with joint R&D with our titan customers, we continue to do well in that segment. That's why for us nothing's really changed. White box is not a new topic for us. We've already been participating in these joint projects. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just really following up, I'm wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more color on how your mix has evolved in terms of verticals? You've talked in the past about the web titans probably exceeding more than a quarter of revenue, and financials as a vertical maybe dropping into the teens versus 2015. You talked about that earlier this year. If we could reflect back on 2016, if you could maybe give us a little bit more color about how your various verticals are trending overall? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Simon, I think if you look at our four verticals, all four are doing very well. The cloud titans continue to be extremely strong. It's greater than the teens. The financials have been holding very nicely. It continues to be in the teens, but is very strong spend there. The service providers, and what I'd also call, the cloud specialty providers, is extremely strong, probably the strongest improvement we've seen in 2016 relative to 2015. And there's a new category beyond the cloud titans. We look at the cloud titans as the largest scale. But the next tier is looking very strong for us, both in terms of cloud hosting providers, service providers, and specialty providers. And then of course, the high-tech enterprise tends to be many enterprise customers but not extremely large deals, not as large as the titans for sure. So all four categories are doing well. All four are double-digit percentage contributions to Arista. And if I had to cite a fifth, I would say the cloud specialty providers is starting to emerge as a category by itself. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Thank you very much. A question for you, Jayshree, and then a clarification perhaps for you, Ita. And question, Jayshree, is if we compare your recent quarterly results for last couple, obviously it's been a lot stronger than even your prior couple quarters before that. And I'm wondering if there's been an inflection point in the last couple quarters that has helped you and what that tells us for 2017, 2016 being a bit of a snapback year for data center spending? And then, Ita, could you help us with the variables that might bring the operating margin back down towards the mid- to upper-20%s level for March? That'd be super. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Which question do you want answered? One or two? Okay. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Well, I guess I will follow up on the other. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. So your question was, was there any specific trend where we ticked higher or differently in the second half of 2016? Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I guess I would point to three trends I'm seeing. I think the overall migration from traditional IT to cloud networking, programmable operating system, highly-available automation, analytics, any workload, these are things that are not just any more for a specific set of niche high-performance customers but is becoming more mainstream. And so we're just seeing this as not one we have to evangelize, but that customers are coming to Arista as the expert, as the thought leader, as the pioneer. So that I would say is a market trend. The second thing I would say is new products. I think last year was a particularly phenomenal year for new product introduction, both switching and routing, and the acceptance of both the R Series as well as the Tomahawk and Trident leaf, and then towards the end of the year Cavium. So we just got a huge upgrade in both the spine and the leaf that it brought to bear. And then the third, which always helps, is customer spending. I think you saw stronger customer spend, which we certainly appreciate and did our best to fulfill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Kind of building off of the last comments there, just trying to figure out here, moving forward, how much of this incremental upside or momentum here in the growth profile is due to just that, an expansion of the portfolio with existing customers versus this portfolio allowing you to also win new customers and penetrate those in a deeper way? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Clearly, Mark, we see both. We are acquiring new customers still at the rate of one a day. But I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that existing customers are equally, if not more, important. So we're getting deeper in existing footprint and we're increasing our new customer footprint. So definitely an and. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ita. Hope you can hear me okay. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. So, yeah, any color you can give us on the project backlog? I'm guessing it's solid here. And then also the Intel Skylake server refresh cycle, Jayshree, how do you think that would help accelerate 100-gig switching this year? What we have been hearing is a lot of your cloud titan customers are starting to upgrade to Skylake front-half of this year. Do you see kind of any readthrough or Skylake as a catalyst for 100-gig switching? No pun intended. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: So, Vijay, just on the backlog question, we don't disclose backlog largely for the reason that it tends to be pretty \u2013 it moves around a lot. So we don't force customers to issue non-cancelable orders, et cetera. So we don't actually disclose the product backlog number. Anshul, are you now going to take the second part of that question? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Vijay, on the server upgrade cycle, the way the cloud operates is that if they have demand from their end customers, they just keep on adding to the capacity. So there isn't a big stall effect as a result of that, but I think for the tariff cycle we expect the customers will deploy these and you'll see these go live in the second half of the year. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. I've got a pretty pedestrian question. Can you give us an update on the routing piece on the R-based products? And maybe if you could clarify is there any \u2013 Cisco referenced tight DRAM memory. Are you guys seeing that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So, hi, Paul. No, we're not seeing any tight availability. I think our challenge is more U.S. sourcing than anything else. That's the bigger order bit. But to come back to your routing question, we have the same common platform for routing and switching. So our proxy for routing is really our FlexRoute. And as you know, I've challenged the team to do \u2013 Anshul, what do you think? \u2013 100 customers in the next year? How are we feeling about that? And my belief is we're kind of at the midpoint there. First quarter was single-digit customers, second quarter was double-digit, and I think we doubled again in Q4. So we're progressing nicely, and by this summer we're hoping to have 100 routing customers for the R Series. And I think that's a good proxy. I would say we're make tremendously good progress there and the R Series has probably been one of the fastest and most well-accepted new products in the history of our company. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Jayshree, just to clarify, did I understand you to say you're around about 50 now on the customer count? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Approximately, at the midpoint, as of February, yes. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: And you can't give us any insight on the revenue yet? Is that correct? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: It's very difficult to split up, because as I told you, the hardware and the platforms are used both for switching and routing. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. I have just a clarification on the numbers and then a question on the new products. On the numbers, we've seen strength in deferred revenues of 40% sequentially two quarters in a row. If you can explain the background for that. And the second question is the 7160 and the AlgoMatch, what are the new opportunities that they address? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. So just on the deferred revenue, Tal, our deferred revenue has a number of different pieces in it, right. There's obviously services deferred revenue, which continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and has been growing healthily. We have product revenue, which is there mostly because there's some type of acceptance criteria associated with that, be it either a generic acceptance period where our customers just have time to evaluate products, et cetera, or there's some specific feature sets that we need to deliver for that to become revenue. So it's really a factor of just timing of shipments, where are their acceptance terms, it will move around pretty much the same as our shipments to some of these customers will move around. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Stanley Kovler - Citi Investment Research (U.S.): Thank you. I wanted to ask about, again, on the supply side you have diversified your supplier base of silicon providers to Cavium. There are a couple of other new products coming to market from a silicon standpoint, and I was wondering if you can address if this is going to impact your existing customer opportunities or new customer opportunities on this new silicon? And if my math is right, I just wanted to clarify that it looks like for the full year in the Americas' vertical, your revenue outside of Microsoft grew about less than half of the Microsoft growth rate. Should we think about that piece accelerating with these potential new products coming online in 2017? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Stanley. So, first of all, we take great pride in diverse silicon architectures. I think we've done 12 different ones with a very common abstraction layer and drivers. The Cavium XPliant is our latest edition. But as you know, we've done many before. We've done Jericho, before that Arad, then Trident, then Tomahawk, then Intel/Fulcrum, and so we're absolutely open to the most competitive silicon. We're very pleased with our partnership with Broadcom, and that tends to be the bulk of our silicon deployment. But we are equally cognizant of silicon diversity, and I don't think we completely answered Tal when he asked the question. The 7160 and AlgoMatch have some very interesting use cases for programmability at the leaf and also at a very attractive cost point. So together with our EOS, we are seeing some interesting applications there. I think in terms of international, we don't see lesser growth. We're seeing good growth. It's just that the cloud titans, in particular Microsoft, dwarf the growth because it's so big. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, for Jayshree, 2017, will the growth amongst your key verticals be quite balanced, or do you think maybe the cloud will be the fastest growing again? That's my first question. And are you still expecting an impact from the HPE relationship and routing really in the second half of the year? Then my question for Ita on gross margin is, the gross margin year over year in Q4 was up, and I'm assuming the previous year you had barely any U.S. manufacturing. So in spite of that headwind, you improved it. Was the mix disproportionally very good in Q4? Or was there something unsustainable in that gross margin number? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Kulbinder, I'll take the gross margin one first. If you look at Q4, we had come into the quarter thinking that we'd be fairly heavily leveraged towards the U.S. sourcing. As the quarter went on, we did get to access international parts and so on, so that's reflected in that gross margin number. I think the guide and you've seen us effectively repeat it coming into Q1, the 61% to 64%. That was a good guide for a situation where we were going to be utilizing U.S. sourcing with some help from some international components. And that's the dynamic that we see as we move through Q1 as well. So I think some of what we got was more the supply chain was more balanced in Q4 than we had expected, right, and that gave us some upside in gross margin. It is a reminder that the gross margin can be pretty healthy if we don't have these temporary cost structure effects, but again, looking into Q1 we see that being back to that 61% to 64% guide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys, and congrats on another solid quarter. Also had a numbers question, and then more of a question-question. But maybe just first on the numbers. Given the better than seasonal strength you're forecasting for Q1, should we be thinking about slightly weaker than normal seasonality during the June period? Is there anything going on there that we should be thinking about? And then I was hoping you could help us understand where you are in the process of developing your domestic supply chain? And in the event the current injunction in the 944 case were to continue and you had to fully leverage domestic supply beyond Q1, if you feel like you've got the capacity and ability to source components in place, and if that were to occur, where would the gross margins end up falling out given you likely have some offsets from software platforms like CloudVision and some of the FlexRoute software on the R series and et cetera? If you could help us work through those matters, it would be helpful. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I think, first of all on the growth, we're pleased with the Q1 outlook, but I wouldn't extrapolate that at this point across the rest of the year. We have a fair few moving pieces to work through the middle of the year. So as a base case, I'm pretty happy with where consensus is from a growth perspective for the year for now. So I think that's probably a good place to start. And then, obviously, if we get more strength in Q2, we'll talk about that. But I think for now, the consensus growth rate is a reasonable place to start, right. In terms of the supply chain, we've continued to invest and develop those sources, both the contract manufacturing and the sourcing. So we're in a lot better position than we were, say, two quarters ago as we look at supporting that U.S. business from the U.S. supply chain. We will continue to make investments. We want to optimize the cost structure, et cetera, to do that but we think we have the capacity and now the focus will be on cost structure and we'll make some investments. You'll see us maybe add some CapEx and stuff over the next couple of quarters as we look to improve that. So gross margins, I mean it's very much within my script. I think if we end up being solely U.S. sourced, then you're looking at the lower end of that 60% to 65% gross margin range. Where we're somewhat mixed, like Q1, you'll see us at the midpoint, the 62.5% is the midpoint of that 60% to 65%. You will see us focus on trying to improve cost structure over time, but we'll lay that out when we feel like we've got it figured out. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So just to clarify how we should be thinking about slightly lower seasonality going forward than we've seen the last couple years beyond Q1 seems to be implied to get to where the consensus is for a growth rate for the year perspective? Is that the right way to think about it? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I think if you're looking at a year-over-year growth rate that's kind of true for a base case. I think that's kind of what we feel is a good base case, maintaining that kind of consensus, low-20% growth rate for the year-over-year and then we'll update that as we go. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we'll learn more as we go along, but that's a good start for February. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, great job on the quarter. I wanted to ask you a couple of things. First of all, just a clarification, Ita, on the $60 million of inventory deposits, is that in addition to the inventory? So should we consider that as additional inventories at prepayments? Can you just kind of clarify what exactly that is? And then I guess, I wanted to \u2013 I can't really believe I'm asking this question given the results, but are you guys seeing optics supply shortages which we continue to hear about from our industry contacts? Are you seeing those in the market and are they capping the growth, so would you have been able potentially to even do more revenue if some of the 25 to 100 gig optics were in better supply? And do you think those optics will be in better supply later in the year? Can you just kind of comment on what's going on with that optics supply? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so just quickly on the inventory deposits. I mean you should think about that as component inventory that's available to us that we funded. And the optics, very quickly on that, we are seeing some challenges in shortages in the 100 gig optics like the rest of the industry. We're getting our fair share but we'd like more. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Did it capture growth in this quarter? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, you know that's really hard to answer, Rod. I mean, it's just \u2013 yeah, I don't know what to say. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: To the extent we shipped 100 gig, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Can you hear me? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. So I wanted to throw you a real layup question and let you crow a little bit since you had such a good quarter. I'm looking at your chart for the system market share at 14.9% at midyear and I'm looking at the down switching numbers that they've been posting and thinking that that number has to have moved quite a bit. If I look at 2014 to 2015, you went from 9.3% to 12% and in half a year, you expanded about the same amount. Where do you think you are as you're exiting the year on that market share chart if we were to extend it out a little bit? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We prefer to let the market share data speak for itself. I don't think any of the analysts have published numbers, but how about we answer that question next month. It's probably \u2013 yeah, in March, we'll have a better idea. What.... Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. In lieu of that, can I address the question of what are you seeing in terms of pricing or response to the fact that they're continuing to fall off the table there? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No change in pricing. It continues to be competitive. Nothing different. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to circle back a little bit on Rod's question on optics, et cetera. How are you thinking about that improving through the year and I would imagine that would also be accompanied by improvement in 100G aggregation switch demand. I'm just wondering does that change in mix, if and as that happens, does that meaningfully impact profitability one way or another that we should be aware of? And maybe you can also talk a little bit about what you think the gating factor is on optics right now. Thanks a lot. Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. James, the real challenge here was the optics companies underestimated the market demand and they weren't ready when the time came. But since then the cloud companies have been pushing them very, very hard. Through the years, the supply should ease out. It's certainly not in the greatest position today, but every quarter it will make progress from what we see. The cloud titans have their own supply chain and they have their own relationships with optics companies and are working hard to build and recover there on their own as well, which is why we are less affected by it because we are not in the middle of that. They control their own destiny. The 10 gig, 25 gig transition is happening this year as we speak. It's tied to mix, FPGA, other things as well. So there's just too many other factors. It's not just a 100 gig optic discussion. But the 100 gig spine are starting to get designed and so on. And, again, I'll just mention the datacenter interconnect and DWDM and all that, but also come along with that. So there's lots of pieces to 100 gig that are starting to come together and I think the industry will make progress as we go through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah, congratulations on a very good quarter. On Microsoft, can you talk about the linearity of your business with them? And if it was back-end loaded, you saw an increase in 2016, are you still projecting that Microsoft will come down? Or where are you in terms of your expectations on that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Erik. So speaking of Microsoft, they continue to be clearly a very important top customer. We did see linearity across the quarters in 2016. And the Microsoft year-end is usually mid-year. So we usually expect to see a strong Q2 or maybe, yeah, Q3 is the way it goes. I guess we thought we would see around 12% of our revenues, so clearly the Microsoft spend being high had an impact on our concentration being high. And so if we were to look at it this year, we expect it will be above 10%, but probably not as high as 16% in 2017 of our revenue. That would be my guess. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Two-parter on the service business, if I could. First, it's been pretty consistent at 12%, you are growing that deferred balance. That's still a good deal lower than most of your peer companies, so can you talk about potential for the service line to start kicking in in a little higher gear? I understand the product is growing rather quickly but moving that up as a percentage. And the gross margin has been pretty strong the last two quarters. Could you just talk about the sustainability of the service gross margin line? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So I think, first of all, Tim, the service revenue as a percentage of overall is where we would expect to be for being such a strong product company. So we don't see that as low. When the product is so strong, the service follows. Maybe in the later years when our product matures, then the service takes over, as you see with mature companies. So we're pretty pleased. We're not expecting to push that line. But what we are expecting to push over time is more and more software revenue on top of that service, like we see with FlexRoute and CloudVision. And those are obviously based on subscriptions so they take a little bit longer to see in material license revenue. Anshul, do you want to add anything more to that? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, Jayshree. That's the right answer. Our products are very early on, so it takes a long time for the services business to catch up in the renewals and so on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks very much. First, are you seeing any significant sales of disaggregated software and hardware? And if not, what's your current expectation of the timing of when that may begin to happen? And then secondly, given the gross margin performance, are we at a place here where if 945 and 944 both win in your favor in the near term where we would actually be above 65% gross margins? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. I'll take the first one and probably Ita doesn't want to speculate on any margin above 65%. So the answer's no for the second. But on the first one, disaggregated, we've always said this, the misnomer on disaggregated is there's only a handful of customers with the development engineers and capability to do this, probably primarily our cloud titans. And so no, we haven't seen a lot of activity, but when we do \u2013 we do expect to see some this year. When we do, I think it'll be a handful of customers, single-digit, and really targeted at their custom environments and their engineering capability for application control. Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to a question I don't think was answered earlier : the Hewlett-Packard relationship, where you stand currently as far as ramping that? And as that ramps, when we should expect to see some contributions developing from that relationship? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No. Yeah, I think we didn't answer it fully, but we are very pleased with the partnership with HPE, from Meg Whitman downwards, executive level, at the field level, at the SE level, at the product level, the relationship is very strong. We have some execution to do. And I think it takes time. Hewlett-Packard has a lot of different switching product lines to consider their own, some of the other partners they had. They have stated that Arista is their preferred partner, but execution and engaging the customers takes time. So I think to see any kind of actual success on this, I've said this before, is probably second half of 2017 and 2018 before we see. And the way we'll measure it is not even material revenue, but customer wins. So we're looking at this across all regions and all theaters, and we see it as very synergistic, very complementary, and things have been going well. We're off to a good start, but a long ways to go on execution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to get a sense for whether you've ramped up your native capacity at the U.S. manufacturers such that you can support your ongoing needs? Or will you still be using your balance sheet for this current quarter? And how much are yields there? And then I think I might have missed it, but what were the lead times last quarter? And where are they right now? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Simona. We're pleased with our capacity. We continue to build on it, and we always like to leverage both U.S. supply and international to the extent we can. And we can always make improvements there. In terms of lead times, they've come back to our normal ones as we predicted. So our normal lead times are anywhere from 4 to 10 weeks, depending on product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for letting me in here. I guess I also wanted to ask about \u2013 I guess related to the discussion of lead times. Have you seen any evidence of customers building inventory as you guys go through this legal situation with ITC or kind of fight against longer lead times? Is that part of the narrative here or no evidence? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: So, George, I think we've been pretty consistent that we don't believe that we're seeing customers do any kind of pre-buys, et cetera. I mean, again, for our key customers, we're very closely aligned with them in terms of the business that we're doing with them. So, yeah, we don't... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean because we have so much intimacy with our customers, the answer is no. We're not seeing any pre-buys or unusual behavior. We improved our lead times. So at this point, they can order up to normal expectations. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Thank you very much for allowing me back in the back of the queue. I appreciate that. And sorry for being presumptuous before with the second question. So allow me to tee it up officially. But, Ita, I'm wondering if you could help us bridge the operating margin gap between where you were in this very, very strong quarter and then where you are starting to look at 2017? It sounds like R&D was a little bit lighter than expected. What are some of the other variables that would bring us back to the normal range? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, obviously, the gross margin is a part of that equation, right? And we talked about that and you see the guide for gross margin. Then if you look at R&D was flat dollar-to-dollar in Q4 and obviously, the revenue grew significantly. That's not a case that we would like to continue. We intend to invest in R&D and invest in sales and marketing as we go forward. So I think Q4 had some once-off, unique attributes that drove that higher bottom line. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Just to be clear, we had some prototype spend on new products that shifted from Q4 to Q1. So that's what kept the R&D flat. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so we should go back to a more typical growth rate on OpEx as we move into 2017. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Perfect. Thank you both. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q4 2016 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation which provides additional perspective on the 2016 fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities Operator : Welcome to the first quarter 2017 Arista Networks financial results earnings conference call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter 2017. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those related to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for the first quarter of 2017 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a pretty good quarter, given our normal seasonality. We demonstrated our predictable and profitable growth with non-GAAP revenue of $335.5 million, as we grew 38.5% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93 with an operating margin of 30.2%. Services contribution was higher at 13% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 79% of total revenue, while the rest of our international theaters progressed steadily in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.2% in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. Our top 10 customers included four verticals, namely, our cloud titans, our cloud specialty and service providers, and financial services. Our new customer acquisition continues to be healthy, made up mostly of leading high-tech enterprise customers. In terms of new introductions for the quarter, we began the year in February of 2017 with the introduction of Arista Data ANalyZers, short for DANZ. DANZ is a programmable state-driven data analysis architecture and software, bringing the next frontier of network packet broker telemetry. DANZ in 2017 is supported in Arista's popular 7150 and 7280R Leaf series as well as 7500R Universal Spine, and this coupled with CloudVision telemetry offerings, delivering any-to-any mirroring of network traffic up to 100-gigabit line rates. This is a compelling advantage of 10x to 60x over standalone products. This includes high-performance hybrid mode operation with traffic capture analysis filtering all in a compact footprint with low power and cost savings. This quarter we also announced the certification of Arista's 7000 Series from the Joint Interoperability [Test] Command, JITC, for inclusion in U.S. Department of Defense, DoD, approved product [indiscernible] (4:45). At Arista's 2017 Analyst Day on March 7 in our headquarters, we unveiled a game-changing containerization architecture, the Arista cEOS. This containerized, extensible operating system provides controls across the server network as containers leveraging the mechanisms of our state-driven network-wide database, NetDB. Customers can now deploy EOS natively as a containerized application, where cEOS supports multi-faceted use cases, including natively hosting containers to create application-specific customizations, network functionality between virtual machine servers and containerized applications, and the simulation of 30 large networks for their behavior under load. cEOS was also demonstrated as the March OCP event with Microsoft SONiC. Our launch of cEOS really underpins our continued differentiation in cloud networking based on five A principles : Available architecture to deliver a self-healing high-quality aperture for data across a highly resilient Leaf/Spine network; Agile work-x delivering microservices for bare metal compute or new workloads such as containers, work streams like video, or workflow for storage; Automation, to rapidly provision a modern software infrastructure for the agile deployment in minutes rather than hours or days; Analytics, tracing deeply the workflow to quickly pinpoint problems through our Tracer technology for dynamic telemetry; and finally, any API cloud whereby the state of the network via Arista NetDB and open APIs offers public, private, and hybrid cloud access with our rich partner ecosystem. As I reflect upon 2017 and our start, I am pleased with Arista's performance and trajectory. Arista has restored the majority of its lead times, as we are now in mainstream production across both our domestic and international manufacturing sites. We continue to invest in cultivating key talent, retaining our engineering groups. To that end, I'm also pleased to welcome John McCool as our new Chief Platform Officer for Platform, Hardware Engineering, and Manufacturing Operations. John has worked closely with both Andy and myself for over three decades as a trusted industry executive. In this newly created role, John will be one of our key assets on the technical leadership team, complementing our already strong anchors, Andy Bechtolsheim, our Chief Development Officer and Chairman; Ken Duda, our Founder and Software Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer; and Anshul Sadana, our Chief Customer Officer. With that, I will now turn it to Ita, our CFO, for Q1 2017 financial details. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2017 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total GAAP revenues in Q1 were $335.5 million, up 38.5% year over year, and above our guidance of $320 million to $330 million. Demand in the quarter remained strong, reflecting continued broad-based adoption of our products. Service revenues represented approximately 13% of revenue, up from 12% last quarter. International revenues came in at $70.6 million, or 21% of total revenue, down from 23% in the prior quarter. We remain focused on expanding our international footprint, but you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployments. Overall gross margin in Q1 was 64.2%, down slightly from last quarter at 64.4%, and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 61% to 64%. This improvement versus guidance primarily reflected a higher than expected consumption of components sourced internationally during a previously open importation window. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $113.9 million, up 8.4% from last quarter. R&D spending returned to a more typical 21.5% of revenue for the period, up from 19.1% last quarter. This reflects expected increases in prototype and NRE spending and continued head count growth. Sales and marketing expense remained at approximately 10% of revenues, down slightly from last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $101.3 million or 30.2% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $0.3 million. And our effective tax rate was 29.3%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $71.8 million or 21.4%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 77.5 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $0.93, up 36% from the prior year. The significant increase in the diluted shares in the quarter was primarily related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. This guidance removes the excess tax benefit on share-based awards from the diluted share calculation, reducing the assumed shares to be repurchased under the treasury stock method. This resulted in a one-off step function increase in our diluted share count of approximately 2 million shares. This increase in share count is recorded on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and reduced our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.02. Those of you who focus on our GAAP financials will note that we recorded a GAAP income tax benefit of $9.2 million in the quarter. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 also resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based awards as a reduction to the GAAP provision for income taxes. This benefit, however, is excluded from the non-GAAP financials, as it relates to stock-based compensation amounts. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $11.5 million for the quarter, just below our outlook of $12 million on the last earnings call. As a reminder, these expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at approximately $1 billion. We generated $162.9 million of cash from operations in the March quarter. This reflects strong net income performance combined with growth in product-related deferred revenue, offset by an increase in supply chain related working capital. DSOs came in at 56 days, down from 71 days in Q4. This improvement primarily reflects strong collections in the quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7 times, down from 2.2 in Q4. Inventory increased to $286.8 million in the quarter, up from $236.5 million in the prior period. This reflects growth in both the raw material and finished goods level and is in line with our strategy of continuing to invest in supply chain related working capital where appropriate. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $39 million of inventory deposits, recorded in other assets, at the end of the quarter. You should expect to see us continued to scale these working capital investments over the coming quarter. Our deferred revenue balance was $497.2 million, up from $372.9 million in Q4. This balance continues to be made of short and long-term service contracts and product-related deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 45 days, down from 62 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 4 million. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond, we're pleased with our continued strong execution in the quarter, with revenues and earnings per share up more than 36% on a year-over-year basis. The fundamentals of the business remain strong, and we are seeing broad-based demand for our products across the customer base. Operationally, we have continued to ramp volumes at our U.S. contract manufacturer and believe we now have the capacity to support the U.S. customer base from this site. In addition, we have worked to solidify our U.S. supply chain. And while we believe this will help ensure availability of supply, it would likely also result in a more consistent use of U.S.-based sourcing over the coming quarters. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows : revenues of approximately $354 million to $364 million; gross margin of approximately 61% to 64%; operating margin of approximately 28%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, with diluted shares of approximately 78.3 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $12 million. Finally, we just received the commission's ruling on the 945 case. Included in this ruling was a requirement that Arista establish a bond to cover the importation and sale of products and related subcomponents subject to the orders during the two-month presidential review period. We currently believe that the maximum payment required under this provision will be approximately $10 million. We intend to record this penalty as an operating expense in the GAAP income statement and will to exclude it from our non-GAAP financials given it's non-recurring in nature. As a reminder, all of these lawsuit-related costs are excluded in the second quarter non-GAAP outlook that we provided above. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call, which also includes Marc Taxay, Arista's Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Mark Foss, Arista's Senior Vice President for Global Operations and Marketing. Your first question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another nice quarter. I wanted to actually try and squeeze two in here. But first, just on the outlook, it appears that your first half 2017 revenue has a chance to actually accelerate year over year. So I guess I just want to understand the breadth and the strength to what degree there's been any pull-forwarded business, if there's any reason to expect less than seasonal trends during the second half of the year? And then the second question, I think we're likely to get a final determination on the 945 case tonight. So, I just was hoping you could update us on where you are in the process of developing workarounds for the patents in that case and if they'll be submitted and embedded within EOS sometime soon. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Jess. We'll try and answer one question, which one? Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess just the business and the revenue outlook seasonality in the second half, and hopefully someone else will follow up on the 945 case and the workarounds. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: You gave them a question to ask. I appreciate it, thank you. I'll get through as many of them as possible. So I think I said we're feeling very good, both about the Q2 guidance we've given and in general our customers' acceptance of our products. As I've often shared with you, visibility in the long term is always hard with our cloud customers, but in general their spending pattern continues. And their investment in CapEx in the foreseeable future, I can't speak to Q4, but I think we can look into the summer and say the trends continue like we're seeing in Q1 and our guidance for Q2. I think in general, what Arista is experiencing here, on one hand it's unique because we're such a strong supplier in cloud networking. On the other hand, it's also a strong reflection of our innovation and investment in our new products. And our new product uptake has been particularly strong. It was strong in Q4, where it was more than 20% of our revenue, and it continues to be strong and stronger in Q1 as well, and I expect that to continue in the second half too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet: Thanks very much, and let me follow up on Jess's question a bit. And that is could you perhaps, Jayshree, talk a little bit about the market segmentation? You have changed your terminology a little bit, and then you talked about service provider this quarter. Is that linked to the acceleration in revenues that you've been able to post over the last few quarters? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. As some of you who were with us at Analyst Day may recall, Arista has really now started talking about five verticals, not four. There are the cloud titans, which tend to be our largest customers, who are deploying over 1 million servers. There's a new category of Tier 2 or cloud specialty providers who could emerge to be cloud titans in the future that are making heavy investments in the cloud space and expect to be public and perhaps hybrid cloud providers. The service providers, which is really the classic definition of service providers, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, the financial services and rest of enterprise that tends to be highly adoptive. All five sectors generally contribute double-digit percentages to Arista's verticals. And, Mark Foss, do you want to add something more to that? Mark Foss - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. We don't usually give out specific breakdowns of the five segments. But we can rank them in terms of the order size for Q1. So in terms of size, the cloud titans was the number one segment for Q1. Number two was the service provider segment. Number three was the cloud specialty provider segment. Number four was the rest of enterprise. And last but not least, the fifth one was the financial services vertical. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Guys, this is Dan Gaide for Mark. So you just mentioned that \u2013 or can you just talk about balancing the percent of components that you're going to be sourcing internationally and domestically and just how that impacts gross margin guide? Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, Dan, I think very consistent with the dialogue that we've had over the last while, we've got a gross margin range of 60% to 65%. And we've always commented that in a world where we're using a balanced mix of components from the U.S. and from overseas that we would be in the middle of that range. So that lines up nicely with our guidance of 61% to 64%. So I think nothing new or different from what we've been saying on the gross margin front. We just see ourselves operating in that kind of balanced mix environment over the next coming quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great, thanks for taking the question. I'm going to follow up on that a little bit. Maybe you can give a little more puts and calls on your inventory during the quarter. I know the window was closed for most of it. You were sourcing from overseas. But the previous quarter you built a lot of inventory in the quarter. Should we expect a little bit lower on your gross margin range because of that inventory when the window was closed? And what are you expecting going forward? Are you still going to source internally? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think it still comes back to that concept of having a mixed balance of sourcing from U.S. component drivers and then some components that will come out of inventory. So we very consciously put the infrastructure in place that we have U.S. manufacturing, U.S. sourcing, and we're going to be leveraging that plus any inventory that we have. So I think nothing new, nothing different here. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: So the window opening and closing doesn't matter really to you? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Obviously at this point, you can see the inventory that we have and we'll continue to leverage that. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Could you comment on your Microsoft business in terms of either growth this quarter or growth you expect for the year? HP lost their server business there. And one potential read is that Microsoft is just slowing their procurement generally speaking. Are you seeing any of that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Steve, Microsoft as a customer continues to be one of our top customers. Their business with us is strong. As I've always commented, it would be difficult to expect them to be the same customer concentration as they were last year, which was I think 16%. But a good guess is they will be in the 10% to 16% range this year. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. I wanted to ask you about some potential shifts possibly in the competitive landscape because Juniper has reported several quarters in a row now double-digit switching growth. And then just recently, they started breaking out the contributions from their cloud customers and that vertical, implying that they're making progress there and that's starting to become a more important vertical for them. So, I just wanted to ask if you've seen them more so than you have in the past. And then maybe just quickly, vice-versa, how your progress is with your routing platform? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, they're both good questions. Thank you, Victor. We do not see any dramatic change in competitive pressures. Our dominant competitor continues to be Cisco. We do see Juniper in the service provider sector specifically when we are competing in routing. As you know, they're quite strong there. But no major change there expect our entry into routing has therefore made Juniper more visible for us in routing. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto from Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - G. research LLC : Hi, Jayshree. HP is planning to shift away from its core legacy network products to selling Arista. Would you be able to share what our expectations should be on the partnership and whether or not it has fully ramped up at the moment? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Hendi. As I said before, we have very strong executive involvement from both the CEO of HPE, Meg [Whitman] and the Executive Vice President, Antonio [Neri]. And mutual commitment to the partnership continues to be strong. But I think both companies would like to see more progress here and are still in the very early stages of this engagement. As I've always said, I expect to see better results in the second half of 2017 and 2018. And both teams are working hard to streamline the training, the process, the channels, and the customer reach. So, we're doing a lot of work, but the real results of this will be more apparent in 2017 and 2018. Hendi Susanto - G. research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Hi, Jayshree, Ita. You had solid results here. My question is on the 7500R, the routing portfolio. We have heard you have over 100 customers for the 7500R. So it would be very helpful to know. Are there any specific use cases in routing or end customer segments in cloud that this product is seeing demand? And roughly what percentage of those 100-plus customers are in product acceleration mode versus more in field trials? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. I expect to see 100 routing customers by this summer, so we're making very good progress to that. I would say we are over north of 70% of that goal. This is both the 7500R series as well as the 7280R, so both products and generally we classify it with the FlexRoute license. In terms of use cases, I think the biggest difference here is Arista is not a legacy router company. And what we're seeing is a lot of routing capabilities where most service providers are transforming from traditional traffic engineered routers to resemble more the cloud. So the cloud network aggregation and core for both Ethernet and IP is changing dramatically, especially with the migration in their backbones and migration to mobile 5G, as well as we're seeing a lot of content delivery networks and peering use cases. So I would say the new norm for SP networks is cloud networking, and that's where Arista is particularly shining and is bringing out its cloud heritage for routing. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Fahad in for Paul. One quick question on your deferred revenue is up very nicely. Can you help us understand what's going on there? And then a bigger broader question for you, Jayshree. From here on, what are the greatest opportunities you see from here and what are the biggest risks? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'll take the deferred revenue one quickly first. The growth you're seeing is partly just growth in services renewals based on the installed base. And then we did see some increase also in product deferred. And again, that's purely driven by the timing of shipments where we have acceptances or features that we need to deliver in the future. So again, nothing unusual there. It's just the normal ebb and flow of the business that happens to result in that growth in this quarter. Jayshree, do you want to take the... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, I think you answered the question well. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up. I think Ita, I heard you mentioned that you just received the 945 ruling. Other than the up to $10 million bond, can you just tell us a little more about what was in the ruling? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Marc, do you want to take that? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure, I'd be happy to take that one. So as Ita said, we did just receive the product termination notice. We actually haven't received the written opinion yet. We're going to get that tomorrow. So we'll know more once we actually get the opinion. But what we know today is that the ICC found that we infringed two out of the six patents that were asserted in that case. One is the '668 patent and the other is the '577 patent. We obviously were very glad that the commission sided with us on four out of the six but disappointed about the other two. As Ita also said, there was 5% bond that was stated in there, and I think we explained that. And at this stage, we really just need to take a look through the decision to see how it impacts our go-forward strategy. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the opportunity within cloud titans. Jayshree, you talked about we should expect Microsoft maybe to come down a little bit, at least as a percentage of revenue. How do you see your opportunities more broadly and over the long run there? Do you feel like containerized EOS opens up a lot of incremental opportunity within the cloud titans? And I guess over the medium to long run, do you think that cloud titans will remain your biggest market vertical, or is there a point in which you think that others can overtake it? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, James. I think the cloud titans will always remain a big vertical. Whether it will be the biggest or not will depend on how the other verticals perform in the cloud space. There's no doubt in anyone's mind that workloads are moving to the cloud. And companies like Amazon, Azure, Google Platforms, I don't know I can list them all out for you, are doing very, very well, but so are the next tiers. So, I think there will be many consumption models in the cloud. And many customers of ours will be successful depending on the vertical stack or offerings they have. They may be different shapes and forms of clouds. So that brings me to your real question. The heart of your question is what about containerized EOS. Today, it's really an architecture and a technology for a handful of very sophisticated customers. These customers basically will be looking for different consumption models. And if you take an example like I've often shared on Microsoft, they have several tiers of Leaf and several tiers of Spine. And they may use our containerized EOS in some use cases and applications to the Leaf, but they may choose to keep the Spine highly, no pun intended, self-contained and well defined as it is now. So we don't expect massive shifts to containerized EOS in the near term, but we do expect containerized EOS to be an important consumption and packaging model for our cloud customers and sophisticated developers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up again on the 945 ruling, the '688 and '577 patents. Can you guys comment on workarounds and just timeline on that, or should we be expecting the timeline to flow the same way that 944 did? And is there a possibility this all is done by the end of this year? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. I'll let Marc answer it. But I think having been through this experience once with 944, we are more comfortable and familiar with the process as well as you are. So I think it will be very similar. We fully expect to have software and possibly hardware workarounds depending around the details once we read the patent. And it will be a process that tends to take six to 12 months. Is that about right, Marc? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's right. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we won't know more (32:00) until we read more closely, so more as we know more. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for the question. Jayshree, it's a question on your cloud titans business. When I looked at and based upon the charts you gave at the analyst meeting, it looks like the next five customers, whoever they are, are probably collectively still smaller than Microsoft. I'm just looking at that. You've had business with them all, dealings I think for three or four years. So how does that market penetration relative to Microsoft being it just takes this long? And is the opportunity ahead of you or is the footprint and the opportunity there just a little bit smaller than maybe three or four or a few years ago? Just any commentary around the cloud titans, would you expect, for example, this year to grow faster than your overall company average? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Kulbinder. I'll try and process your questions. There were multiple subplots in that question. First of all, the cloud titans are healthy. They're doing well, and I think they'll continue to do well. Many of these cloud titans we have now worked with an average of three to five years. So they know us. We're intimate with them. They've operationalized us. The cloud specialty providers and the service providers, both those are new categories who could potentially spend like the cloud titans, but we're anywhere from our first year to third year with them, so Arista are much newer to them and they to us. So depending on their success and where they're trying to be successful, I think they could be very large customers for us, perhaps even as large as some of the cloud titans. But they just aren't as far enough along with us or we with them. So I think... Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess, Jayshree, my point is just in the cloud titans, not in either of the specialty providers, just in the cloud titans, Microsoft you're doing very well with. All of the rest of them, the five or so customers that are in there I guess, aren't as big as the Microsoft business yet despite you having business with those five customers for a number of years. So I'm talking about that specific opportunity. Has that taken longer to penetrate than you thought? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, so I'll leave it at this. Several of them are in our top 10 customers, so they're doing quite well for us. But it is fair to say that of all the cloud titans, Microsoft is doing better than any of the others. For us and perhaps even in the industry, they and Amazon lead everyone. So I think you're just seeing the reflection of the industry trends on Arista customer trends. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Your line is open. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask a question about linearity. In the first half of the year, it seems like you're benefiting from a little bit of pent-up demand, and your lead times have come in now with the backdrop of Q2. As we think about the rest of the year, there are going to be other demands for some of your customers as they begin to potentially shift spending to servers and those product cycles. Can you help us understand the ebb and flow of spending in the data center that you expect to impact between the server/storage and networking as we get through the year with some of the competing product cycles there that they have funds for? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure, Stanley. First of all, we probably don't see the ebb and flows you're describing between server/storage as a purchase segment versus networking. At any given time, the networking component of our total data center is 10% to 15%, so the server and the storage is significantly higher. So we tend to have networking operational experts who plan the networking piece. So therefore, how it ties into ebbs and flows, the server and the storage spend usually occurs at or before the network comes in. That's how we have really seen it, and therefore the tie is more loosely coupled than you're stating. In terms of lead times, our lead times have become very predictable right now. So customers are able to plan better, and certainly they work with us on anything they need in the next and the forthcoming quarter. But anything beyond 16 weeks is difficult for us to get visibility from them on. And also, for their planning, they have to plan on that since some of our lead time components are that far out. So I would say one or two quarters, and generally 16 weeks is a good boundary condition for how they plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Can you comment on the DANZ product? Did you see that gain momentum in the quarter? And you said that your advantage is 10x to 60x. Is that based on a cost advantage you can provide the customer, or can you discuss that in a little detail? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. So we introduced the DANZ in February, and it's based on our new products, the 7280R, the 7500R, as well as the ongoing support we've had on DANZ in 7150. The reception has been very good. It's only been a quarter since we introduced the new features. But I will tell you, similar to routing, I expect to see 100 new customers in the first year of DANZ. However, the size of these deals vary depending on how much monitoring functionality they need in a small use case versus cap aggregation at 100-gigabit Ethernet type of capabilities in a larger scale use case. So we're seeing both. So in terms of competitive advantages, we're not trying to build cap aggregation as a sole monitoring product. Our emphasis is clearly high port density, the ability to run in switching, mode in parallel, so that customers can mix and match switching and DANZ in a common chassis, and routing in some cases, as well as the footprint and power and price/cost capability. So all of that is factoring into the 10x to 60x depending on which metric I'm looking at. The customers are very pleased with our system-wide focus of not just how do we do DANZ, but how do we do DANZ with our Leaf/Spine networking portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you, congratulations on a great quarter, a clarification and a question for me. The clarification, when you say 20% from new products, can you just mention what those new products you include in that category? And then the question, Ita, your short-term deferred has doubled in two quarters, doubled. It's a little bit hard to think how growth in services contracts can really make up for that big of a jump. So clearly, a lot of customers \u2013 or very few customers are putting a lot of money up front with you. Is there any color you can give us that helps us profile those customers or the type of the use cases or the products for which these orders are going forward? Is there any way you could give us some color on what's being built up there? That would be great. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, you guys, clearly, services is a piece of this. We have seen the product deferred grow. Some of it is linked to the new products and just an increase in the number of customers who have some acceptance terms around those new products. And the rest of it really is timing and timing of shipments in the quarter. If you look at the mix of customers in that group, it's across the customer base. There's nothing particular to any one of the verticals that Mark and Jayshree talked about earlier. It really is more tactical and in a lot of cases in terms of new products have an acceptance clause. And then depending on when you ship, that determines what that balance is. So, the balance is cycling as you go quarter to quarter, and it really is just a question of what do we ship and how do we ship in the quarter and how much of it ends up going to those customers and ending up in the deferred. So, I still encourage everybody to think about it more as a tactical balance as opposed to something that's strategically reflecting some shift at this point. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, and what is included in the category of new products? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: The R-Series routing products. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: The 7280R and the 7500R are the primary ones. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Very good. Good luck, ladies. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Ittai. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. It isn't often you get to say congrats to ladies only. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hello. I just wanted to follow up on the deferred revenues. Ittai asked about the jump that you've had. Ita, what should we expect in the second half for deferred revenues after the strength that you've seen over the last couple quarters? Should we expect the deferred revenue balance to continue to grow at the same rate? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'm not going to try to guide the deferred revenue balance. It's tough enough to guide the revenues. I think as we see some of the new products become more mature, that's when we may see some decline on that. But again, in the context of at least on our current guidance, we're not factoring that in. So, I know it's interesting and intriguing, but really it is more tactical in terms of what's in that balance. So, it will move around, and again I wouldn't read too much into it. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you for taking the question and also congratulations, ladies. I hate to do this, but I'm going to go back to the deferred discussion. I think as we look forward and you see the short-term deferred build so much, I'm curious of how you think the contribution of your total services revenue will grow relative to total revenue over time. And then also more importantly, where do you think the gross margin of the services business could go? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, Ita, go ahead. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think the services revenue has been growing as a percentage of total revenue over time at a nice, steady growth rate. We've seen it go from 11% to 12% to 13%. And I think it can continue to do that, but it's going to be at that steady pace. What's your entitlement, could it be as much as 15% from pure services, maybe, but that will take time. The growth, the margins on the services side, it's a little chunky in that the cost structure tends to be fixed and going in blocks. But it's probably \u2013 right now it's probably operating and it's as high as we would expect to see it operate. But you could see some chunkiness in the gross margin if we have to put in a new piece of infrastructure to support something. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And you guys don't quantify the product deferred. Is that correct? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: We don't split it out. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We split it into long-term and short-term. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Long-term and short-term, but we don't break it out between services and products. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks. Thanks for taking the quick question here. Just on the 945 results, I was wondering if you could give us a quick refresher on inter-party PTAB process, the review of the '577 patent and the timing of that and what the strategy could be now that you've learned the fate of the 945 patents? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. So yes, there are two IPRs that have been instituted on the '668 and the '577 patents, which were the patents that were found to have been infringed in the 945. There were hearings that were held at the PTAB in March, and the final decisions by the PTAB will be issued by June 11. So from a timing standpoint, as you probably know, there's a 60-day review period \u2013 presidential review period following the issuance of the final determination of the ITC. So that should come out to July 3, so the PTAB decisions will come out several weeks before that. At this stage, obviously we've been evaluating, as I said a moment ago, our design-around strategy. We are obviously preparing that strategy in the event that we were to lose the IPRs. And as I said, we just received the final determination, so we have to go through the actual written opinion to see how that flows through. But certainly, our plan would be based upon our review of that. We have several different options that we're evaluating, and we'll have something together before the end of presidential review period. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Marc, is there an appeals process to the IPRs, or is it just that's the final decision when that comes out and there's no follow-on to that process? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: There is an appeal process, like everything else. There would be an appeal I think to the Federal Circuit. But once those \u2013 assuming for a moment that the IPRs that were instituted actually that we prevailed, the view to the ITC as I understand it would be that they'd be considered in effect. And the order wouldn't apply to us. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Got it, thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q1 2017 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation that provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website.

Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Arista Networks' Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer; and Marc Taxay, Arista's Senior Vice President & General Counsel. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter 2017. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter of 2017 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had quite the record quarter. We achieved milestones in just about every financial metric as we crossed the $400 million sales mark for the first time with revenue of $405.2 million, growing 50.8% sequentially year-over-year. Our record profitability was demonstrated by our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.34 and an operating margin of 36.3%. Services contributed approximately 13% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas made up 75% of our total revenue while the international theaters in specifics to EMEA and APJ progressed steadily at 25%. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.4%, well balanced across our five verticals and product mix. Our top customers were represented by all five verticals in the following order, Cloud Titans, Cloud Specialty Providers, Service Providers, Financials, and the Rest of Tech Enterprises. Our new customer additions were higher this quarter, exceeding our normal typical one a day acquisition. In terms of new introductions in Q2 2017, this May, Arista introduced the next generation of our universal leaf and spine that we call the R2 Series. This flagship platform delivers cloud-scale routing with R2 Series line cards for existing spine system, new leaf switches and a new 16-slot universal spine. With the R2 Series and the 7516 Chassis, we continue our track record of backwards compatibility and forward investment protection. These platforms deliver breakthrough benchmarks of 15 terabits of capacity, range of 60 to 576 100-gigabit Ethernet port density, with future support of 400-gigabit Ethernet. Our Universal Cloud Network designs are in full form, scaling out east/west and scaling up north/south. Arista's FlexRoute technology has now doubled to support 2 million routes, accommodating almost three times the size of an Internet routing table. The 7500R2 Series also supports data center interconnect with secure encryption with MACsec at 100-gig line rates and coherent 200-gigabit DWDM with distances greater than 5,000 kilometers. Leveraging our Broadcom partnership with Jericho Plus merchant silicon, Arista is accelerating the legacy router to transition to programmable multi-gigabit routing with twice the density and half the power. Our clean-sheet approach to both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions, leveraging Ethernet-based virtual private networks, EVPN, for both data planes of MPLS and VXLAN was demonstrated as part of the public multi-vendor interoperability showcase at the NFV World Congress in March of 2017. Clearly, we are witnessing a migration from legacy routers to the state-of-the-art routing use cases for Internet Exchange fabrics, additional network function virtualizations for both cable providers and mobile providers. As I look at our Q2, we have built a sustained culture of innovation, integrity and execution, ushering and leading our customers into the cloud era. As an example, Arista has upheld its leaders category for the third consecutive year in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, with making great strides in both axes. Number one, for completeness and vision and almost a close number two, in ability to execute. In late June, the Bay Area News Group published the Bay Area News Top Workplaces with a list of 95 best companies to work for in the San Francisco Bay Area. Arista has been named to this list at number five in the large company category with more than 500 employees. In summary, as Arista completes its exceptional quarter, our business model and our foundational strategy remains purposed and unchanged. We believe we are gaining market share in high-performance data center switching, specifically with the number one spot in 100-gigabit Ethernet port switching with over 40% share, according to Crehan's Q1 2017 report. As I reflect at our mid-year 2017 accomplishments, I couldn't be more proud of our team's results on multiple fronts, solid financial metrics, customer quality and intimacy, and a highly differentiated cloud networking suite of products. This is the Arista way. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ita, our CFO, for Q2 2017 financial specifics. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 2017 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our select GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $405.2 million, up 50.8% year-over-year and well above our guidance of $354 million to $364 million. Demand in the quarter exceeded our expectations and reflected continued broad-based demand for our products, not only in our cloud vertical, but also across the customer base. Service revenues represented approximately 13% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. International revenues came in at $101.2 million or 25% of total revenue, up from 21% in the prior quarter. We remain focused on expanding our international footprint, but you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on the timing of U.S. and international deployments. Overall, gross margin in Q2 was 64.4%, up slightly from last quarter at 64.2%, and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 61% to 64%. This improvement versus guidance largely reflected higher than anticipated revenue levels, resulting in increased leverage in our fixed cost base and a healthier mix of international sourcing in the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were $113.9 million, flat to last quarter, resulting in significant operating margin expansion on a quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rate of approximately 21%. R&D spending came in at $70.9 million, or 17.5% of revenue, down from $72 million last quarter. This reflects reduced prototype and NRE spending following the launch of our R2 products, offset by continued head count growth. Sales and marketing expense was $34.6 million, or 8.5% of revenue, up from $33.6 million last quarter with increased head count and demo-related costs. Our operating income for the quarter was $147 million, or 36.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $0.5 million and our effective tax rate was 28.5%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $105.5 million or 26%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 78.8 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $1.34, up 81% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $12 million for the quarter. Included in this amount are bond costs associated with the 945 final determination, which requires Arista to establish the bonds to cover the importation and sale of affected products and related components during the two-month presidential review period. As a reminder, these legal costs and related expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now, turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We generated $79.2 million of cash from operations in the June quarter. This reflects strong net income performance, combined with growth in deferred revenue, offset by an increase in supply chain related working capital. DSOs came in at 61 days, up from 56 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of billings in the quarter. Inventory turns were 1.6 times, down from 1.7 times in Q1. Inventory increased to $363.8 million in the quarter, up from $286.8 million in the prior period. This reflects growth at both the raw materials and finished goods level and is in line with our strategy of investing in supply chain related working capital where appropriate. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $34 million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets at the end of the quarter. Our deferred revenue balance were $554.5 million, up from $497.2 million in Q1. This balance continues to be made up of short and long-term service contracts and products-related deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables. Accounts payable days were 51 days, up from 45 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.2 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we experienced exceptional growth in both revenue and earnings per share in the second quarter, reflecting record demand for our products across our customer base. As we look forward to Q3, we believe that the fundamentals of the business remain strong. And while we were disappointed that the 945 orders were not suspended, we are now firmly focused on implementing product redesigns and working with customers on qualification so that we can meet their needs in compliance with the orders. Operationally, we are now at scale with our U.S. contract manufacturer and believe we have the capacity to support U.S. customer demand from this site. In addition, we have worked to solidify our U.S. supply chain and believe we can now support a more consistent use of U.S.-based sourcing as needed. At this point, I would reiterate our previous discussion on gross margin as it relates to design-arounds and U.S. manufacturing. We believe gross margins may be negatively impacted by these activities in the coming quarters and could range from 60% to 65%, depending on how heavily weighted our revenue mix is toward U.S. manufacturing and sourcing in any given quarter. We experienced significant operating leverage in Q2 with operating margins of 36% on a quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rate of 21%. Based on our current view, we expect revenue growth in Q3 to moderate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with expenses likely growing faster than revenues as we make the necessary investments to support the business. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuit, is as follows : Revenues of approximately $405 million to $420 million, gross margin of approximately 61% to 64%, and operating margin of approximately 30%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.5%, with diluted shares of approximately 79.6 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $12 million for the quarter. This includes the remaining 945 bond costs associated with Q3 activities. As a reminder, all of these lawsuit-related costs are excluded from the third quarter non-GAAP outlook that we provided above. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : Thank you ever. Your first question comes from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Clearly, a very strong outperformance here. I'm just kind of curious if you can give us a better sense in terms of the relative contribution to this growth, Jayshree, from the Cloud Titans and the Service Providers. And then for Ita, just kind of curious around the commentary around expenses outpacing revenue growth going forward. What are going to be the targeted investment areas and when do we expect a return on those investments? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. As I said, all of the verticals grew very well. They were all double-digit percentage growth. The Cloud Titans was number one and clearly our largest contributor, as it typically is. We were very pleased with the growth in both Cloud Specialty Providers and Tier 1, Tier 2 Service Providers. They were number two and three, but almost neck-to-neck, followed by the Financials and Rest of Enterprise. So, every one of them grew well and every one of them was double-digit growth. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And I think, Mark, when you think about the commentary on investments, it's really \u2013 I mean, we grew revenues 21% in Q2, expenses were flat. Right? I think really what we are guiding to in Q3 is more of a normal return to investments on the OpEx line versus a more normalized quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. So I don't know if there's anything particularly different there; it's just more the trend is changing Q2 to Q3. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Congrats, first of all. Fantastic quarter and guidance. Jayshree, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the top line outperformance. Specifically, how much of it was kind of routing-driven versus switching? And then, Ita, regarding your outlook margin commentary, clearly you keep beating it, the operating margin outlook, and, I guess, that no one would suspect that you're not going to do the same in September quarter. But even modeling at mid of the range, I mean, the assumed increase in expenses from June to September to get to 30% operating margin is steep in a way that it has never been accomplished by you in the past. So, what's going to be unique this time or should we just assume upside again next quarter? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Let me take that one first. I mean... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: All right. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, again, I'd encourage you to kind of listen to our guidance. I think 30% operating margin is a good healthy guide. It is a quarter where we are reserving degrees of freedom to invest where we need to and to manage through the quarter. So I think I would listen to the guidance. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, I wanted to add to that of what Ita said. I think we were all pleasantly surprised, just as you were, with the 36% operating margin and we wouldn't want you to take that to the bank every quarter. Our business model is not on that. But with a combination of product mix and very strong customer spending from many verticals, we all got pleasantly surprised. We like to be pleasantly surprised every quarter, every year, but we want to count on more normal behaviors. Regarding contributions to growth, both our switching and, of course, our routing are doing very, very well. You may remember, I challenged the team, Anshul and his team, last summer to have 100 customers, and we have doubled our customers again this quarter, and we have exceeded 100 customers with the FlexRoute license. In particular, the R Series, both the 7500R and 7280R is our flagship routing and switching products that were last year contributing about 20% to 25% of our revenue. So, new products of 20% to 25% and they jumped in the first half to over 30%, up from zero last year in March. So, really good progress on the new products and they are definitely fueling our growth in 2017. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Congrats. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Could you comment on your expectations for your Microsoft business? I think you've been talking about 10% to 15% of revenue. The revenue number now, of course, is much higher and Cisco did announce that Microsoft Azure would be using the Nexus 9K. Are you concerned about any encroachment there? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No. I think, as I've always said, nothing's really changed here. When I look at cloud in general and Microsoft, Cloud Titans tend to favor and want a dual-vendor strategy. So, I would be remiss in not pointing out that while Arista is the primary vendor in many cloud accounts, including Microsoft Azure, we haven't really seen any appreciable change in that mix. Microsoft continues to be a very important partner. We fully expect it to be a north of 10% customer, even though our revenues increased, and the range has not changed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Just I'm going to ask the inverse of that question, Jayshree. When you think about your Cloud Titan vertical, excluding Microsoft, what was the pace of business with those other accounts and sort of how do they shape up with pipeline going through the second half of 2017 here? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's a good question too. I think one of the things that made Q2 exceptional was the fact, Alex, that Microsoft wasn't the only contributor. We had a number of Cloud Titans and Cloud Specialty Providers contributing into the number. And their pace of growth is equal or better. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon, Jayshree, Ita. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Vijay, good afternoon. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. My question is on better understanding the product cycle dynamics in 100-gig switching and then heading on to 400-gig. So, help us understand, Jayshree, where are we approximately in this product refresh cycle? Are you primarily seeing 40-gig refresh to 100-gig in the spine? Are we still super early days in terms of Top of Rack? And then when would these Cloud Titans cut over to 400-gig? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. That's a very good question, thoughtful question. First of all, I think we are in very early stages of 100-gig upgrade cycles in general. 40-gig was a window of opportunity, mostly in the enterprises, but almost every major cloud is going to 100-gig spine. Right? And I think that cycle started for us with especially the R Series. There's a little bit of it in the E, but it really started in 2016 and I believe it's a five-year cycle. The five-year cycle on 100-gig is going to fuel the next cycle in 400-gig. It's still too early to predict exactly when it will start. I think it's fair to say the optic cycle has started sooner than the switching and routing 400-gig cycle, but we anticipate that will be in the next one to two years for certainly the early adopters like the cloud guys. And then I think 2019 is a good year to think of for 400-gig. So I think majority of the cloud verticals are making sure that their designs, their network designs are 400-gig capable so they can activate them in the same spine chassis as the 100-gig. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. A quick follow-on for Ita. Ita, as we launch this new merchant silicon like Jericho Plus, Tomahawk 2, on and on, how should we think of product gross margins? Would those new chipsets be lower gross margin than current silicon? Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we haven't really seen any great variance in the gross margin based on the silicon. So I think you should probably think about it as business as normal as we make those product transitions. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Maybe for Jayshree, can we get an update on where we are with the HPE relationship? I assume that's not adding much in terms of revenue and that would be an incremental driver, as it were, in the second half and going forward. And then for Ita, on the ITC side, just to be clear, is the workaround available yet to customers or not or are you removing it from product or what exactly is happening there? Many thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Kulbinder. Actually I'll take both questions. On HPE, it is not material right now. The teams are very, very hard at work and have been for the last six months to a year. I believe we will see the results of our labor really, and as I've said before, consistently in second half of 2017 and more likely 2018. And even when we do, I think we got to be realistic that HPE is very strong in the midrange enterprises and international customers. So we would measure HPE as a more strategic partner to complement our sales coverage model and really partner with them where we are not. And this is really important to understand, not to focus on the five verticals we have, but to complement the five verticals we have. And regarding, what was your second question? Where we are on the ITC and workarounds? Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: You can imagine that we have been preparing for these 945 workarounds very similar to the way we were preparing for the 944 for almost two years. Right? Be clear that customers have already started preparing with us. We are in beta this quarter and we are in the midst of active beta testing for them, and this is very similar, again, to a process we went through this time last year with 944. There is a combination of both the software release certification and in selective customers that need high performance echoes, there may be some hardware qualification as well. So we expect the completion of these new releases at the tail end of this quarter, Q3, September. Typical qualification time can take several weeks, four to six weeks. And so you can expect our systems engineers and our engineers in general are working very closely with our customers. I want to reiterate, of course, that we are fully complying to the order and we are making sure that all the products that's shipping domestically is not infringing and addresses the two patents in 945 that we were found to infringe from USITC and we were found to be invalidated by USPTO. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And would you say, Jayshree, there's any impact on revenue growth from any of this and how you thought about the outlook going forward? Not really, sounds like. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Could we have given you better guidance than we did for Q3? Is that your question? Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Kind of, yeah. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we did the best we can between what we believe our execution will be and what our realistic guidance is. So, taking all those, you can imagine we took all of those risk factors into consideration to provide you the guidance. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And we believe that September will be a crucial month in our quarter to execute on these workarounds, and the guidance reflects that. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another nice quarter. First, I wanted to follow up on Kulbinder's question and just wanted to clarify if you do expect to be able to ship your full suite of products this quarter. And then secondly, I was hoping you can help us understand how we should be thinking about the gross margin dynamics over the next few quarters, to what extent your guidance assumes you'll need to more aggressively leverage domestic supply or do you have enough inventory on hand at least for this quarter that it's probably not much of an issue but becomes more of an issue down the path? Any kind of insight on that would be helpful. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Jess, I'd kind of take you back to kind of the conversation we had last quarter as well. I mean, we are running the two supply chains kind of in parallel. Right? So, we do have inventory and we do plan to leverage that, but we're also maintaining and running our U.S. sourcing. Right? So, it will be somewhat balanced between the two. I think that's why the guide is kind of 61% to 64%, pick up the midpoint of 62.5%, plus or minus. We'll see where we come out. But I think that's the thinking. Right? And then, obviously, over a longer period of time, if we ship more to the U.S., that's when you would see us move to the lower end of that range. But I think, for the interim, you should think about it as a balanced U.S. and inventory-based sourcing. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And just to answer your question on shipments, obviously, we are continuing uninterrupted supply to the international customers who are not affected by any of these USITC orders. In terms of domestic shipments, we are doing limited shipments right now. And if I were to predict, I would say our shipments will be less linear this quarter and we will be back-end loaded in terms of shipments to accommodate some of the customer certifications and qualifications I mentioned earlier for the 945 workarounds. So, obviously, our Q3 guidance is taking all that into consideration, but we feel good about the shipments. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. I guess I'll just congratulate you again. These are phenomenal numbers. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, thank you, Rod. We don't mind hearing it over and over again. Thank you. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. One is the growth source on the international business, that really accelerated a lot this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about, are those the same customers you've had internationally that are just growing more? Or have you developed some new revenue sources there? What's driving that growth? And then I also \u2013 I guess I wanted to ask about containerized EOS and how that's progressing and whether you think by the end of the year that could be a material source of revenue? Just kind of \u2013 how are things going with containerized EOS? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Rod, so, as you know, our international business did contribute, as our revenue growth, if we can keep 25%, that's pretty good, especially given the strong Cloud Titan contribution we always get in the U.S. But one of the very interesting things, and I'd actually like Mark Foss, our Senior Vice President of Field Operations, to comment on this is we are seeing a very interesting pattern. I talked about the high customer acquisition rate and a lot of that contribution comes internationally. Do you want to talk about that? Mark Foss - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Roughly 50% of new customers we acquired in Q2 were international. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So, that is far greater than the revenue contribution and I think that's a good sign for us of things to come in the future. So, we are sowing the right seeds right now in terms of investment both in our sales and go-to-market strategy and our customer acquisition. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And then containerized EOS? Can you update on that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The containerized EOS, we continue to get a lot of reception from a technology and architectural point of view. I think the adoption of this is still very early stages. We have yet to really publicly announce any production version of containerized EOS, but I think it will take 2018 to really see some of that. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I just had a quick clarification. Maybe, Jayshree, can you explain how the interaction between the PTO and the ITC works now going forward? And at what point do they come back (30:24) Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: James, we can't hear you very well. I'm going to try and repeat your question so that I got it right. Can you explain the interaction between the two legal systems in the U.S. government? Is that your question? James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Yeah. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. This is better now. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just trying to get \u2013 can you explain the interaction between the PTO and ITC going forward? And then just a broader question is with where you're at now and with the mix that we're looking at, particularly with HP and international, should we be thinking about 30% potentially being kind of your new level of operating margin target? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Let me address the first one and I'm going to turn it over to Marc Taxay. As you know, first of all, we got caught between two legal systems, the USPTO invalidated two patents in June of 2017, and the USITC declared an infringement and an import ban in July of 2017. So, this is the legal system at work for you, and we're clearly disappointed. I will let the legal pundits decide if this is a really fair policy or needs reform. But, Marc, you've been living this assault for the last two-and-a-half years, and in particular, the last two months. Do you want to share your thoughts on the scorecard and what you think of that? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, I'm happy to do that and happy to talk about the interplay, too. I mean, I think it's worth noting, I mean, just given where we are today and where we started. From our perspective, we're actually quite pleased with the status of the litigation, having narrowed the current focus of the cases from 14 patents and the various copyrights that were originally asserted against us down to the three patents in play now. One is the subject of the redesign of customs and DoJ has found to be not infringing. And then the other two, as you point out, were the subject of PTAB decisions that determined that those two patents were invalid. With respect to the interplay, essentially in the 945, the ITC order went into effect prior to the PTAB decisions. We sought a suspension of the ITC's remedial orders based upon the PTAB decision, and the ITC made the decision that given that those PTAB decisions occurred afterwards and that technically speaking those patents don't get canceled until the completion of appeals, that they \u2013 essentially what they said was you have to wait until the appeals are completed before they would be able to suspend those \u2013 formally suspend the orders. So, what we have done is really a couple of things. One is execute on the strategy that we've had in place here now for some time. We always have that strategy completely independent of the IPRs. We have also, and the ITC has filed a motion to stay in the ITC, and we're waiting on a decision from the ITC with respect to that. If the ITC denies that suspension as well, what we will do is file another motion to stay in the Federal Circuit and we'll wait to see there. But, again, I think the important part as Jayshree and Ita said is we're moving forward on the strategy that we had set up, again, quite some time ago. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And then just back to your 30% operating margin question, I mean, I think in an environment where we're growing at the pace that we're growing that that's probably not an unreasonable view of the world. But, I mean, it is somewhat being fueled by the top line growth that we see. Right? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Congrats again on a tremendous quarter and guide. I guess, I wanted to ask about lead times. I think going back to Q1, you guys mentioned that lead times came back into a more normal range. I presume, with all the demand you're seeing, they are stretched, but maybe you could give us an update there, that would be terrific. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, George. Thank you for the good wishes. Yeah. I think one of the things Ita and John McCool, our new Head of Manufacturing, and the whole team have done is really put a plan in place. You heard Ita talk about the inventory planning that's gone into place. And I think U.S. manufacturing is pretty much a new norm for us. And we are running two contract manufacturers worldwide, both in the U.S. domestically and one internationally. So, lead times are very much in control and they have not changed for the better or worse. They remain consistent from Q1. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and also congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to explore again this quarter the continued accelerated year-over-year growth in your deferred revenue, in particular short-term deferred revenue, and how we should think about that balance relative to that being recognized as the revenue stream. And maybe any kind of feeling for what you are expecting that short-term deferred revenue balance to kind of trend like over the next couple of quarters. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think you can see in the numbers, right, it did tick up a little bit on the short term. A chunk of that will be services. There's a little bit of product growth there. It's a difficult number to predict and we deliberately don't guide it for that reason. I wouldn't expect it to continue to grow. All right? I think that's probably all I would say at this point. Right? I don't think it's \u2013 it's probably not reasonable for us to expect it just to continue to grow over time, just given the nature of what it is. Right? And then we'll see where we are when we kind of \u2013 we get to the end of the quarter. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And Aaron, you have to realize that in the last year, we've had a lot of factors for our growth. We talked about the 100-gigabit, we talked about the routing, we talked about the Cloud Titans. We also talked about the new product qualifications. So, that has not only impacted our overall business, but it's impacted our deferred revenue and some of the new features we have to qualify. So, it's been unusually and particularly high and we shouldn't take this as a norm. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just to understand that, so, as you turn those features on, that revenue immediately kind of gets recognized over the course of that next quarter or two? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's all about what the acceptance term is in the particular contracts, and that's going to vary across the different contracts. If it's related to a feature, then you recognize the revenue when you deliver the feature. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you. Jayshree, you guys are normally very conservative when it comes to guidance, but it seems like you really under-forecasted the top line in Q2. I guess, what do you think changed, I guess, is kind of the main question I had. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I think we try to be responsible more than just conservative. And I think what changed is that our customers surpassed any forecast we had, to be blunt. And it was also Anshul Sadana, our Chief Customer Officer's first full quarter. So, he just kicked some butt. So, a special shout out to him. But look, guys, and in particular, had we known it was going to happen, we would have had more linear expenses. We didn't have a chance to catch up on expenses. So we just had a very good quarter and I'm very proud of the team. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Well, are there any specifics that you can point to in terms of 100-gig accelerating faster than you expected or any particular customer segment? I mean, is this just as simple as every major customer you had spent a lot more? I mean, why? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So I think I said a few things. I'll repeat them. 100-gig acceptance is very good. We have the number one market share. It's north of 40% in Q1. I believe we would have continued that trend in Q2. Our routing customers stepped up from the switching. We're now over 100 customers and so we are making good penetration in both the cloud vertical and service providers, especially with routing. So, that was a big deal. Our new products started contributing even more to our overall revenue in going from 20% to 25% to now north of 30% in Q2, so that's a pretty big contribution. Our cloud verticals, all five verticals did well, but in particular, our cloud verticals, both the Titans and the Cloud Specialty Providers did very, very well. And while they were doing well, it's not like anybody was slacking. The other three verticals were contributing. I would give a special mention also to our engineering team for not just the innovation and disruption they keep creating, but the high standard of quality. So I don't think it was one thing; it was everything. And certainly we wouldn't be here without the intimacy with our customers. They all are looking at Arista in a much more strategic foundational way for their networking decisions. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. And, I guess now that we are north of $400 million and you've given us guidance that that's sustainable into the September quarter, is there anything that you are able to share with us about the trajectory from here? Or even do you feel that these numbers this quarter and the next quarter are sort of a sustainable base from which to grow from? I just want to make sure that we are not either under or over-projecting this spectacular quarter. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I think I'll let Ita speak to this as well. I think you really bring up a good point. This is a spectacular, exceptional quarter. Please don't expect us to do this linearly every quarter. It would be tough. Right? I think we just got a great sort of confluence of lot of good things that happened. However, we think our total available market is still very good, and Arista is still in the teens, probably around 14% or 15% of our primary market share with adjacencies in routing, with adjacencies in data analysis. The acceptance of CloudVision has been very good. It's not a major revenue contributor yet, but you may remember last year I told you we had over 100 customers and we are well on our way to doubling our CloudVision customer base as well. So, our software contribution, although small, is becoming very strategic to our placement. So I think our foundation and our fundamentals are clear and we have to just keep executing. So, short of any crisis, we hope we'll continue to do that in forthcoming quarters. We don't want to project a year or next year. It's too early to call these things, primarily because the cloud spend is generally short term. We only have visibility to one or two quarters. So it wouldn't be responsible of us to say much more. Ita, you want to add something to that? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think that's right. Q2 was exceptional. I wouldn't extrapolate that. I would think about it more in terms of just nice, solid, consistent execution. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. I just wanted to make sure that I understand what assumptions are being reflected at the extreme ends of the gross margin range. So for example, does the high end of gross margin guide incorporate an assumption for a specific probability of U.S. manufacturing mix? And if that's the case, what could gross margins look like if you were allowed to import freely without any restrictions at all? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the way to think about it is the two book ends. Right? The higher one is where we have freedom of operation and we are heavily focused on international supply, et cetera, we're leveraging all of that. And then the 60%, the bottom end of the range is really an environment where it takes a long time to get through the customs process, et cetera, and we are becoming very heavily focused and utilizing U.S. supply and U.S. sourcing. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So, the high end assumes complete freedom in being able to import. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The high end assumes that we're back to more or less to normal and we think that's what that range would look like from a sourcing perspective. The lower end assumes we're heavily in the U.S. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I just ask because the high end of that range seems pretty consistent with what you've seen over the last six quarters, I guess. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Right. And we've been fortunate in that the timing has worked out where we've been able to leverage a lot of international supply kind of through that time period. Right? I think now we are looking at it as more strategically, and we said this last quarter, right, that we were going to look at it more strategically and maintain the U.S. sources and make sure that we were using those U.S. sources consistently. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and congrats. Ita, now that your U.S. manufacturing facility is at scale, what kind of gross margin impact should we anticipate going forward? Does at scale means that you have lessened its impact on gross margin today versus months ago? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I don't know that I'd say that. I think at scale means we're happy with the supply and the availability of supply there and the capacity. I think if you look at the gross margin guidance that we talked about, it's pretty consistent with what we had before. Right? And we're still expecting that we will carry some overhead burden from sourcing and operating in the U.S. So I think the ranges are what we gave, the next quarter 61% to 64% \u2013 in a prolonged U.S. environment, 60% gross margin as a floor, I think that's the way to think about it. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. If you can just remind us the revenue that you had in the quarter from routing. I know you said you've already surpassed the 100 customer mark, but can you just let us know what the revenue from routing was? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So, Fahad, we don't break down routing because most of our platforms that we ship, ship with both switching and routing. So, our best way of describing routing is through our FlexRoute licenses, which then you translate into the number of customers. So, what we're really saying is we now have over 100 customers deploying routing in production one year after introduction. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just to be clear, I think if I go back, in my notes, I think you had previously said you expect about $50 million in incremental revenue in calendar 2017 from routing. Are you at or anywhere close to that mark or you've significantly surpassed that milestone? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean, like I keep telling you, it's difficult to track that. Do you count the line card as switching or routing? Do you count the chassis as switching or routing? And the FlexRoute licenses are software. So, if we start giving you numbers, then it's shared numbers between switching and routing and that's why we're not going there. It's too confusing. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then you have now got the R2 platform, which significantly expands your TAM to address more telco-related routing use cases. And one, looking forward into 2018 and beyond, do you think routing \u2013 where should we be thinking routing should be as a percentage of revenue? Again, I realize it's hard to predict, but the deeper penetration that you are driving now with telcos and the telco cloud on the routing use cases, how should we be thinking about that? And then I have a follow-up on... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think the best way \u2013 we can have a longer discussion, but for this earnings call, I would say the best way is to look at our number of customer acquisitions. That's a key. And then our success in service providers. Those are two strong indicators of how we are doing in routing. And don't let the dollars confuse you because routing and switching are truly coming together and there's less and less of a standalone router market except the legacy guys. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. You've significantly outperformed your competition. Can you let us know on where pricing is? Has there been significant changes in pricing over the last quarter? Do you see competition trying to... Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Fahad, we want to... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: You've gone to three questions. I'll answer this politely, but our pricing has not changed for us. It always is competitive. Our competitors love to buy business and tank their prices whenever they see Arista. But as we've repeatedly said, I think Arista is evolving into a stronger and more strategic cloud networking provider. This is our DNA. So, it's not surprising that while our competitors attack us on pricing or mimic our buzzwords and do some marketing that we're not seeing any big changes and fluctuations. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciate the questions. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Fahad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: And, by the way, this is our last question. So, please go ahead, Stanley. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. It's Stan Kovler. I just wanted to ask you in terms of the attribution and some of the upside to growth. How should we think about some of the near-term visibility that you actually have? Is a lot of that also a function of what's coming off your balance sheet? You mentioned that you are adding some features that were in the deferred revenue and in conjunction congratulated the engineering team for presumably delivering that. And from a demand perspective, a lot of it is coming from the spine. So I'm wondering how much of that is a function of you avoiding some of the slowdown in like the server and storage market where they are facing more component shortages when you think about cloud builds in general? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. I think I followed the question. Are you asking how did we manage our leaf and spine and there are some issues on the leaf side with storage and compute. Is that your question? Did I understand you correctly? Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I'm just wondering where the outperformance came from. Because if you look at other areas of spend in cloud, there were some challenges in other areas basically from a pricing standpoint. So I'm wondering if the fact that you have deferred revenue and you're more levered to the spine now with 100-gig than Top of Rack, if those are some of the elements that are helping you avoid those potential areas of shortfall. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I'm going to defer the deferred revenue question to Ita. But just to be clear, our cloud revenue is very real in networking. And when you look at these large CapEx spends from the Cloud Titans and Cloud Providers, you can recognize there's buildings, facilities, cooling, power, compute, storage. And the networking spend is actually dwarfed by all of that. So the networking spend is healthy and Arista is getting its fair share because of its competitive products. So we're doing fine. Both in the leaf and spine, I want to be clear on that. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And, Stanley, if you look at the deferred, deferred revenue is actually up quarter-over-quarter. So, I mean, there's no deferred revenue practice happening there. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q2 2017 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results that you can access on the Investors section of our website. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer, Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer, and Marc Taxay, Arista's Senior Vice President and General Counsel. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter 2017. If you'd like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, industry innovations or market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter of 2017 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had another solid quarter. We achieved record revenue of $437.6 million, growing 50.8% sequentially year-over-year, coupled with strong profits with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.62, and record operating margin of 38.6%. Services contribution was approximately 13% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas made up 71% of our total revenue, while the international theaters contributed higher than normal at 29%. This can be attributed to the highest shipments and organic growth this quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.4%, well balanced across our verticals and product mix. Our top customers were represented by all five verticals in the following order, cloud titans, Tier 1 and 2 service providers, cloud specialty providers, high tech enterprises and financials. Our new customer acquisition continues to be brisk, especially in the international theaters. A key highlight in the high-tech enterprise vertical was the highest number of customer acquisitions in one quarter, signaling the main stream arrival of million dollar customers in the enterprise vertical. In terms of new introductions in Q3, in this September, Arista introduced a very strategic offering, moving from legacy Places-in-the-Network to Places-in-the-Cloud, called PICs. Our Any Cloud software platform is based on our virtual EOS Router and CloudVision Cloud Tracer for visibility metrics. We are truly enabling hybrid cloud networking with leading partnership offerings including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure Stack, Google GCP, Oracle Cloud and Equinix Exchange. Arista Any Cloud is indeed a profound approach, as it extends the compliance and visibility of our EOS from the private premise to the public cloud workloads. This September, Arista showcased our state-of-the-art media and entertainment offerings at the international broadcast conference in Amsterdam, including live multi-vendor video workflows, with over 15 technology partners. Our (04:40) programmability and visibility is well-suited for media broadcasters, and content distribution guaranteeing real-time delivery. Arista is truly migrating analog video SDI to digital IP for video editing, rendering, and virtual reality. In terms of Q3 recognition, we received some key awards that we're really proud of. The Bay Area News Group published the Bay Area News Top Workplaces and Arista has been named number 5 out of 95 companies in the large company category with more than 500 employees. We also received accolades from Fortune Magazine as number 10 out of 100 of the top fastest growing companies in America. I would like to comment a little bit now on cloud spending, for that seems to be a popular and keen topic these days. As you all know, Arista has experienced unprecedented growth in the first three quarters of the year with stronger than expected demand from our major cloud titan customers. Due to this unforeseen demand for initial 100-gigabit routing and switching deployments, we have been experiencing almost 50% growth in the past three quarters, instead of the more normal 20% to 30% consensus growth being modeled by our analysts. Following the July ITC order, we introduced our 945 workaround features in mid-September. Consequently, this lengthened our customer testing cycle and qualification time, extending the completion for three of our cloud titan customers into Q4 2017. Therefore, we saw slightly lower cloud titan business in Q3 than we expected. I am comfortable that this near-term impact of certifications do not affect our cloud business trajectory. In summary, Q3 once again reflects Arista's proven track record of execution, despite some challenges we faced. In Q2 2017, we steadily gained market share in high performance data center switching, both in ports and in revenue, according to all the major market reports. Crehan Research has reported that Arista had 14.2% and 15% in dollars and ports, respectively, of market share. Combined with Arista's superior quality and architectural 5A innovations, we are experiencing a broader inflection and acceptance into the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for the Q3 2017 financial specifics. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2017 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $437.6 million, up 50.8% year-over-year and well above our guidance of $405 million to $420 million. Service revenues represented approximately 13% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. International revenues came in at $128.3 million, or 29% of total revenue, up from 25% in the prior quarter. While some of this shift in geographical mix represented the timing of U.S. shipments, we also experienced healthy growth in our in-region international businesses in the period. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.4%, consistent with last quarter and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of 61% to 64%. Higher than anticipated revenue levels, combined with the more favorable customer mix, contributed to this outperformance. Operating expenses for the quarter were $112.9 million, down slightly from last quarter. R&D spending came in at $68.6 million, or 15.7% of revenue, down from $70.9 million in the prior period. This reflects reduced prototype and NRE spending, offset by continued head count growth. Sales and marketing expense was $35.5 million, or 8.1% of revenue, up from $34.6 million last quarter, with increased head count and demo related costs. Our operating income for the quarter was $168.8 million, or 38.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million and our effective tax rate was 24.7%, resulting in net income for the quarter of $128.2 million, or 29.3%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $1.62, up 95% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $7.9 million for the quarter. As a reminder, these legal costs and related expenses are excluded from our non-GAAP results discussed above. Now turning to our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at approximately $1.3 billion. We generated $205.9 million of cash from operations in the September quarter. This reflects strong net income performance combined with a decrease in supply chain related working capital. DSOs came in at 45 days, down from 61 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of billings in the quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7 times, up from 1.6 times in Q2. Inventory decreased to $333.2 million in the quarter, down from $363.8 million in the prior period. This reflects reductions at both the raw materials and finished goods level as we continue to optimize our supply chain. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $32 million as inventory deposits recorded in other assets at the end of the quarter. Our deferred revenue balance was $565.1 million, up from $554.5 million in Q2. This balance continues to be made up of short and long-term service contracts and product-related deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables. Our product deferred revenue declined slightly in the quarter, contributing to our revenue outperformance. Accounts payable days were 19 days, down from 51 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.6 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect revenues to range from $450 million to $464 million, representing 40%-plus year-over-year growth at the upper end of our range. We continue to work closely with customers on the qualification of our 945-related product redesign, and we expect this to have some impact on our business in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, depending on the timing of shipments and product acceptance, we expect our product deferred revenue balance to decline in the period. Operationally, we now have access to international sourcing for our redesigned products following the recent Federal Circuit ruling. As part of our overall supply chain strategy, we will continue to leverage our U.S. manufacturing and some U.S. sourcing capabilities as we move forward. We experienced significant operating leverage in Q3 with operating margins up 38.6%, well above our historical run rates. These margin levels reflect exceptional top line growth in the last number of quarters with revenue growth outpacing spending. While we will remain cautious in relation to our spending ramp, we expect that over time our operating expense investments will gravitate towards long-term model of 20% R&D, 10% sales and marketing, and 3% G&A. In particular, with reference to the fourth quarter, we expect some significant R&D-related investments that will result in higher spending in this area. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and any legal costs associated with our ongoing lawsuit is as follows : Revenues of approximately $450 million to $464 million; gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%, and operating margin of approximately 30% to 32%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27%, with diluted shares of approximately 80.1 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $12 million for the quarter. As a reminder, these lawsuit-related costs are excluded from the third quarter non-GAAP outlook we provided above. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Unknown Speaker : Operator. We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you specifically about cloud, as you anticipated, and the question is really some of your competitors were talking about challenges more in the routing area, and so, there's some architectural shifts that are happening in this space. I know your customers, you said, are going through a period of digestion for your products. What's the opportunity for the regional routing piece of the business into those accounts? Is there an opportunity for additional growth or for growth to accelerate, particularly when it comes to FlexRoute licenses and things like that? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'll take the question, Stanley. Thank you. So absolutely. I think Arista has been experiencing a changing architecture and a 100-gig transition since we announced these products in 2016. So this is not new for us. And really, we pioneered this change with the FlexRoute license where increasingly what we're seeing as a trend across our customer base is more and more of them want to replace routers with routing. And frankly, legacy vendors are on the wrong side of this trend. So as they may be experiencing a contraction in their routers, we are experiencing an inflection in routing, and our FlexRoute licenses continue to increase. You may remember I had challenged the team to do over 100 customers with FlexRoute in the very first year, and we achieved that last summer, and now, we've exceeded 150 customers. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And if I could just follow-up, more on the deferred revenue side, can you help us understand of the flexibility you have in revenue recognition and walk us through, once again, the varying pieces of deferred revenue, and how we should think about that, beyond the two quarters? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, again, I think the makeup of deferred revenue is really two buckets, right? One is services, which is kind of short-term and long-term services, and that gets recognized as those services are delivered over time. And then, we have the product deferred revenue, which is really around acceptance clauses with customers and the delivery of new features, right? And I think the timing of that depends on when you ship and it depends on when the customers accept. In Q3, we saw a slight reduction in deferred. We would have still exceeded the top end of our range without that. So I think it was pretty minimal. As we look into Q4 right now, we'll see where we come out. We expect that it will come down, based on what we can see now, and then, we'll see how it plays out as we go through the quarter. Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, Ita, on the profitability. I know that you've had a tremendous couple of last quarters, especially relative to your expectations for revenue, and you've also outlined kind of that you plan to get back to your operating model, but what about the gross margin line? That also continued to do quite well, and as a result, you're pulling through again, it looks like, for the December quarter, total operating margins that look to be well above your long-term target. Does it make sense for us to start thinking about your long-term target being closer to the high 20s or 30%? Or how should we think about that? Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I think what we're seeing, certainly, when the gross margins are operating in the 63% to 65%, is that, much as we thought kind of putting this out there as a target, it's becoming a 30% to 32% operating margin business, and I think we're comfortable with that, certainly, for the near term. Again, the investment thesis, I think, we're clear on. It will take us time to get there, just given the rate that we've grown at. But it's the gross margin, we'll see what it does. But I think those are the drivers, right? James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi, Jayshree, Ita. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. My question, Jayshree, is on 100-gig port prices are declining, but Arista is beating numbers, in fact, crushing numbers. So like to get your bigger picture view, Jayshree, on what's driving the growth in 100-gig ports? Is it workload growth? Is it buildouts of new data center capacity? Is it legacy port refresh to 100-gig? And how do you prioritize these demand drivers in terms of port growth? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Vijay, that's a good question. I think the 100-gig transition has surpassed even our expectations this year, and as you might know, most market studies show us now as at number one share, with about 40% market share. I think the main reason we're seeing that is because the 100-gig has become the Universal Spine's not only in the data center, but it's sort of stretching, I should say, to incorporate a lot of the switching and routing for regional and data center interconnect. So what we're seeing is this trend, the architectural trend that we've been espousing for a couple of years now, where the LAN, the WAN, and the Layer 2 and the Layer 3 are all coming together to be a highly elastic Universal Spine. And this year has been definitely an inflection year, and a starting year. But I must underline that I see many years of robust growth of 100-gig ahead, and we're just beginning this year. And with the entry of 400-gig, I don't see that the 100-gig in any way will change. So I think what you're seeing is a significant investment with our top customer base across all five verticals. And while we may be a little more aggressively penetrated in the cloud titans, it's really applying to all the verticals. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Jayshree, if I could take you back to the Web 2.0 architectural shift question, the specific question being, are any of the cloud titans, those top four, five using FlexRoute at present, or have any of them made awards to you to use FlexRoute going forward for the peering DCI use case. And a related question, I've seen the numbers. They speak for themselves, but are you seeing any inventory buildup and how much visibility do you all have as to the quarterly rhythm of demand from, especially, that cloud titan group? Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Because I have a short-term memory, I'll take the first question, and then, I'll go to your second. So visibility with our cloud titans, we continue to have an extremely intimate relationship with them. We have not seen an appreciable change in the visibility or the competitive landscape. As we have repeatedly said, because they are in a high-velocity, high-growth mode, the visibility we get is typically good for one to two quarters. And even then, it can change. It was bigger than we saw in the first three quarters of this year. But it's a very strong communication. There's very strong intimacy. This is an area where not only Anshul Sadana, our Chief Customer Officer participates, but our entire engineering team is very involved in the roadmap, in the demand, along with our systems engineers and sales teams. So I would say we've got good visibility for one or two quarters, and we've got medium to low visibility thereafter. And probably that's just generally true. It's the nature of the business. In terms of FlexRoute license and routing in general, absolutely, some of our early adopters have been the cloud titans right from the beginning in 2016 and they continue to be major deployers. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Jayshree, those folks who are adopting FlexRoute, they were previously using an MX router or an ASR 9000? Any sense... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...you can give us for what you just placed then (22:14)? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's correct. Just to put this in context, until 2016 or 2017, we were only in the leaf and spine layer. With the arrival of the FlexRoute license and the ability to scale and improve and just basically provide more routing features, we entered additional layers of the spine for routing and data center interconnect where traditionally they were core routers either from Juniper or Cisco. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and congrats, ladies, and Charles, for the results. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ittai. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I guess I have \u2013 I have I guess \u2013 it's multiple questions, but it all ties into one thing which is your R&D investments. You've talked about some delays in certifying the new hardware for the cloud guys, and it's understandable since it wasn't just a simple software workaround. It was a little bit more complex than that. But that delay, plus the fact that R&D expenses are now sequentially down for two quarters in a row, I guess it comes together into this question of, are you under-investing? Are you at a point in time where if you don't ramp very quickly, it will hurt you soon, somewhere, sooner rather than later? And again, tying it to Ita, to your guidance, your guidance implies a massive expansion of OpEx on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and even last year, in the fourth quarter, that has not happened. So unless you have a unique ability to absorb hundreds of employees in an extremely short timeframe, which I doubt you can, because you are very picky about who you pick, help me tie this together. How can you get to those expense levels? On the flip side, Jayshree, how can you keep investing and keep up with everything that's coming up, and the legal certainly throws another wrinkle into this, and some resources have to be dedicated to that? When does this start hurting your business, the fact that you don't have the head count available? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Well, we'll try to keep our answer shorter than your question, Ittai, how about that? Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: That's... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'm teasing you. Well, let's see, so I think our engineers know that they have unlimited hiring capabilities, but they have a very high bar. So we continue to hire very, very well in engineering head count, but frankly, many of them don't make our bar. So if we are limiting hiring, it's not because we don't want to hire, but because we are limited by the talent pool in a geography. So one of the things we are doing is expanding geographies beyond our headquarters here in Santa Clara. But I just want to high-five and give kudos to our engineering team for dexterously developing new products, doing very good engineering recruiting and still keeping the bar high. I'm very proud of that. Having said that, what seems to decline and go up and down are the other variable spends. We don't control sometimes the chips and when they come out and the associated prototype and the NRE spending to go with that. So I think, in general, we're doing better in head count on the engineering investment side, but we could do even better and we expect to in spending more money in Q4 in the non-head count department. In terms of the legal, there's no question in our mind that we dedicate a lot of engineering resources to legal. However, over the last three years, which is we're on our third year of legal, we've been doing workarounds for many, many years. And I would say more time was spent this quarter, not necessarily on just developing the legal workarounds, clearly, we had to scramble to do more of that and get it out in September, but also in qualifying it. That's where our systems engineers and our sales and marketing resources were more tested. So overall, I'm comfortable and confident, Ittai, that we can continue the head count ramp and that we can grow into new markets organically, and there's always a possibility we do things inorganically, as well. Ita, you want to add to that? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, Ittai, I think the thing to remember is that the R&D head count and that part of it has been growing consistently, right? Where you see the lumpiness is really all around prototype and NRE type expenses, right? So I think in Q4, as we sit here today, we believe we'll spend some meaningful money on some of those kind of one-time items in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to ramp head count, right? I think over time, our goal is to get back to that 20% of revenue. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Very good. Just a follow-up, Jayshree. As you look into your future roadmap for 2018, has it been delayed because of the legal workaround work or pushed out? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: In some cases, yeah, in some cases, we have had to push out some of our priorities for customers to prioritize legal workarounds that were more time based, yes. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Very good. All right, good luck. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: KeyBanc. Did you like that, Jayshree? So I'll keep it short here. When we think about these three trials that got delayed on the 945, were these projects that were identified and were going to be revenue this quarter, and now, they'll just kind of move into Q4, once the 945's work has been certified? Is that \u2013 so there's a real line of sight on this business? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, as I said, we have pretty good line of sight with our cloud titans, and absolutely, there were projects that were identified. Let me reiterate and be really clear that we did not lose to any competitor. It just is taking a long time. It can take anywhere from 2 weeks to as much as 10 weeks to do these certifications. So lengthening the qual cycle and getting them these workarounds in mid-September didn't give us much of a chance to certify them in Q3. So we expect most of them will move to Q4, or worst case, Q1. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And have you seen any shift in top-of-rack versus aggregation mix within the cloud titans, say, over the last couple of quarters and what they're communicating to you about their plans going into 2018? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: From everything I can see, the mix has stayed the same. Obviously, our aggregation has moved more to 100-gig and our top-of-rack has moved to 10-gig, 25-gig, and 50-gig in the leaf, so \u2013 but no, we haven't seen any big change in mix. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And I don't know, is Marc in the room? I just had a question about... Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: We need to limit the questions. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Can we go to the next question, Alex, and we'll get to you later? Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah, we'll ask in this call back. No worries. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to see if we could follow up on this hot topic of what's going on in the cloud. So I understand your explanation and was hoping we could get a little bit of quantification around why the degree that the cloud titans were softer than you expected. And you've cited the evaluation, which while it makes sense to me, I guess I'm trying to understand the bigger industry picture and hoping maybe you can help us understand what's going on with other companies. So certainly, your direct competitors, where you're taking routing business, that makes sense why they would see softer business, but what about all the other companies in the supply chain into web-scale citing slower demand? Can you help me put that in perspective? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, it's difficult enough to talk about my company, let alone help you with other companies. I'll try, Simon. I think if I step back and look at the big picture, the reason Arista is less affected by what other companies are is, frankly speaking, we're on the right side of these trends. We're developing 100-gig, we're developing routing, we're developing the right optics and DWDM capability, and these are all the modern architectures that cloud wants to move to. So I guess we don't have the overhead of legacy, is the best way I can say this. We're also underserved and (30:43) underpenetrated although the cloud has been our most important vertical for some time now. The 100-gig movement is just very early stages. I'm guessing even with the titans who are some of the earliest adopters, it's still in the 10% to 20%. So while the others may have had more absorption and I can't really speak to or may not really have seen this architectural shift coming, I think Arista has been thoughtful that \u2013 and built the right products and these are all new products that we pretty much put out in the last six quarters. And I think that we are benefiting from the trend. I think the second thing is we're not relying on one titan. It's really important to understand that when we say cloud, increasingly, it's not a vertical, it's a horizontal. Cloud principles are being deployed across all our five verticals. So our top 20 customers, 30 customers are all deploying cloud architectures. Now, the scale varies greatly with the titans and is different, obviously, for the other customers. So therefore, even if we experience, like we did, a delay in certification and a lower contribution from the titans, the titans are still number one in an aggregate, because it's a number of customers there. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And can you help us with the quantification aspect, whether percent of revenue or how different it was from what you expected, just any quantification element? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I said it was slightly lower from prior quarters. Hopefully, that quantifies it. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I was looking for a number. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Simon, I don't know that you can put a number on that. I mean I think at the end of the day, what we're saying is that we're working through the qualifications. We've seen some effects from that, but the business with these customers and the activity levels of these customers, we haven't seen any change in that. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Please try and limit your questions to just one, folks. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes, thanks for taking the question. On the routing products, can you talk about what kind of discounting you've been offering, and how the gross margins on that compared to your traditional switching products? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: You want to take it, Jayshree? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, sure. Go ahead, Ita. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we've always said, Erik, that the routing is accretive, right? And we're definitely \u2013 we're creating significant value there versus what's available prior to this shift, and I think we see that that is accretive to the gross margins. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Do you \u2013 we've heard that you're not discounting nearly as much as on the switching products. Can you talk about what kind of discipline you've had, from a discounting perspective? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think our discipline applies to both routing and switching. In general, the customers see the value of our quality of software, the programmability, the underlying architecture being network-wide database oriented, the analytics, the automation, the single binary image. So both of that applies to both switching and routing. Routing, in general, tends to be fewer boxes and fewer ports, but higher margins. And switching is connecting to the servers and storage, so it tends to have more pricing pressure. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks. I was just hoping you could clarify your comments. So on the one hand, you're saying that the qualifications for the cloud guys has taken a little longer and is pushing business out of 3Q and then into Q4, and then, on the other hand, you're saying that that's not an impact on the numbers, and I'm not sure I understand what you mean by those two statements. They seem to be contradictory. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We're saying that we didn't do as well in the cloud titan in Q3 as we did in Q2. That's what we're really saying. But that doesn't mean the other types of customers didn't contribute to our number. So all five verticals did well, and it was very balanced. Cloud titan is still our number one vertical. So I don't think they're mutually contradictory statements. They're actually connected, right? Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: So if the cloud titans are... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: (34:53) Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: If the cloud titans are coming back in on the fourth quarter, and the other guys don't change trajectory, why wouldn't it accelerate in the fourth quarter then? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean we're growing at, like, 50%, year-over-year, Alex, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I don't know that it accelerates off of that. I think Q3 we had some impacts and Jayshree has said it was a slight impact from the qualifications and so on. And we'll see what happens in Q4, right? We have work to do there, and we're working through that with them. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I have a seven-part question. I'm just kidding. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: One question for me, kind of building off the last question, actually. So given your commentary around certification, we're just kind of curious, in terms of, can you talk a little more about the other customers who are doing well, shouldering some of, maybe, the certification overhang from the cloud titans, because I'm trying to get a sense, as you move into 2018 and beyond, are you going to start standing firmer and taller on other verticals beyond just the cloud, if everything kind of works in unison? Is that routing? Is it enterprise? Like, what verticals are helping offset some of this cloud certification overhang? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think if I look into 2018, some of the fastest-growing verticals besides obviously a clear contribution from cloud titans that we expect is service providers, high-tech enterprise and cloud specialty providers. All of these three are smaller today for us than cloud titans, but have an ample opportunity for growth. In the case of the service providers, they are going through a re-architecture. They're operationally very dependent on their legacy architecture. So it takes time to move, but we feel optimistic that there are some changes happening there and have already happened there by virtue of service providers now being our second largest vertical for two quarters in a row. The cloud specialty providers, they look a lot like the titans, except their sizes are different. And probably my most exciting message to you would be we feel like the enterprises have a lot of legacy fatigue. And they are starting to show some real momentum, and I expect that this strength we showed here with both international and with enterprise customers, this was our largest number of million-dollar enterprise customer quarter. I hope it's not a one quarter trend and it continues, and that will have some contribution in 2018. Mark? Is that okay? Did I answer all seven parts of your question? Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Just one question. Thank you. Good afternoon. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: All righty. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I'm on for Steve Milunovich. I wanted to better understand the lengthened qual cycles you're seeing in the cloud. Is that because your workaround includes using a different silicon vendor? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Not particularly. So just let me kind of step back and give you some description of the quarter, because it really was an interesting quarter. In the beginning of the quarter, in early July, we were shipping normally, and then, on July 5, we got the cease and desist order, right, Marc, around then? Marc Taxay - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, July 4. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. So we had a busy season, because as soon as we got the cease and desist order, you might remember that these are the same two patents that were invalidated by the PTAB, that now the International Trade Commission, ITC, issued an order on. So our engineering team had to scramble to get out a workaround on, basically, invalidated patents. We got that dichotomy going on. So we introduced a new EOS release, 4.19, around mid-September. And so now we're actively engaged. We only had two or three weeks in the quarter to certify, and we did do a lot of certifications. But these qualifications times can be related to software only, or in some cases, in the case of the ACL workaround, it can be a combination of software and hardware. And both are features that are not transparent to the customer. In other words, the customer has to put it in and it really depends on their use cases and scale and complexity. So if it's a simple network, they may not need to do much and two weeks may be fine. If it's more complex and they have a lot of ingress and egress ACLs, then you have to go through more qualification. So that's why you have that wide range, because we're committed to non-infringing workarounds on invalidated patents, I might add. However, that engagement with the customer can be short or long. Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. And one final question. Could you comment on your software-only revenue and how meaningful it's becoming? You mentioned over 150 FlexRoute software licenses and you also have CloudVision. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no, we not only increased \u2013 thank you for letting me speak about that. This is a proud moment, because I think it's an indication of how the networking business is truly migrating to software-driven networking. We not only exceeded 150 routing customers, but we have now also crossed 200 CloudVision customers. And we have several trials going on. So my anticipation is while it is not yet reportable, so, it's not material revenue, and again, because it's a software subscription over multiple years, I expect in the next two years that this business can become approximately a 5% of our revenue. Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I guess you'll hold me to that, so check-in in two years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about some of the latest developments on the routing side. Obviously, there's new silicon in the marketplace. I know you guys are continually kind of working on feature development. The question is, as you continue to drive things on the silicon side and feature side, talk about those features and capabilities and how they expand your TAM on routing. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Well, I think there are three aspects to how we've gone about our routing endeavor, from a development point of view. One, as you rightly point out, is just using, pardon my French, some kick-ass merchant silicon, right? And what I mean by that is, everybody gets access to the same silicon, but somehow, we've been able to get more routes, more data paths, more convergence, more scale, more services out of it. And this is a true engineering feat that we apply not just the silicon, but this is indeed one of our closest partnerships with Broadcom, especially on the Jericho family and chip set. And it's something we've been doing across three generations, Petra, Arad and Jericho to really maximize the feed, speed, scale, and performance. And I cannot underscore that enough. The second thing is, we augment it and we complement that with our own co-processors, silicon drivers, et cetera, and a set of capability that the silicon may not have to enhance it. And again, this is very important, because in routing, there's routing features, and then, there's use cases that we go into. And so, we've been going into some very specific use cases in the content, media, cloud, routing aggregation, high-performance core, even some 5G wireless. So those become the way we really approach it so that we're not just building, again, yet another router 20 years later, but we're really zooming in on the importance of the features we have, including the third area, which is our EOS programmability and routing protocols. We've got just about every four-letter acronym covered there, including a BGP stack that is much more robust today, as we've been working on it for several years, control planes with VXLAN-EVPN and segment routing, and also MPLS features with some traffic engineering. So it's really been a three-pronged approach to attack and provide simplicity and elegance in our architecture, and yet, state-of-the-art performance and protocols as well. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : And then the TAM question, I guess, I'm just curious about how much you think you're driving the TAM up. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we're contracting the router TAM and increasing the routing TAM, but it's always been difficult to call it out as a separate TAM, because it sits on top of our switches. So I think the platform is the same, but the software TAM is jumping on it. So it's a shared platform with multiple features on it. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, George. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, George. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Good evening, Jayshree and Ita. You call out strong International sales in Q3. Where do you see strong International sales in terms of regions, verticals and use cases? Are there certain use cases that drove strong International sales in Q3? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no, this is one of our prouder moments, I think, because we had a lot of international shipments in Q3 and we had a particularly strong Asia-Pac and EMEA. Mark Foss, you've been driving some of this. You want to comment on it? Mark Foss - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. As mentioned, the Americas business was about 71% of revenue. It broke out to where EMEA was 18%, and the APJ was about 11%. And as Jayshree mentioned, we had a very strong quarter for new customers acquired internationally with over half of the customers \u2013 new customers we acquired were international. But the organic international customer revenue has been growing faster than the company average. This removes out any global customers which may be headquartered in the United States. But the organic international customer revenue has actually been very strong for us. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I wanted to also put in a plug for the leadership team there. Naresh (45:07) in Asia-Pac, Guenther and Ken Kiser were running EMEA and the international regions. We've been investing in them now for the last year or year-and-a-half with Mark Foss' leadership, and I think we're finally seeing the fruits of our labor here. While I don't always expect it to be 29%, because the cloud titans might contribute to change that mix, I think that's a sign of things to come. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: So, use cases are broad-based? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Use cases and country adoption is broad-based. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q3 2017 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Tal LIani - Banc of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Welcome to the fourth quarter 2017 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Business and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. If you'd like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website.  During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. Industry innovations, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck and welcome back. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. As you can see, our profitability growth combination was once again demonstrated with our non-GAAP revenue of $467.9 million, while our non-GAAP EPS grew to a record $1.71. Service contributed approximately 13% of revenue. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 65.9% due to the favorable cost and lower cloud titan mix. Overall, in 2017, gross margin came in at 64.8%.  In terms of customer trends, as of December 31, 2017, we have now acquired over 4,900 customers, with Microsoft becoming 16% of the total revenue for the year. The Q4 2017 international contribution was our strongest to date at 33%, with the Americas contributing 67%. For the full year, the Americas was 73% and the rest of International at 27%. In terms of verticals, in Q4 2017, Enterprise was our number one vertical for the very first time in our public company history. Cloud titans was the second largest vertical because of some 945 legal certifications, where some of the complex use cases testing spilled into Q1 2018.  In terms of new products, December 2017, Arista unveiled its next generation of cloud grade routing. Arista EOS version 4.20 with FlexRoute, delivers transformative routing and automation. And with that, we can now address a myriad of peering use cases across cloud, content delivery, and internet exchanges. One such example in cable networks is operators migrating from traditional head end to service rich virtualized access together with our technology partner, Harmonic.  Undoubtedly, 2017 has been a significant year for Arista. We increased our employee strength to 1,800, with 45.8% annual sales growth, and $1.646 billion in revenue. For the first time in nearly two decades of stagnant IP, Arista is offering that compelling alternative. Legacy vendors are on the wrong side of this trend, with traditional places in the network. Instead, what Arista is doing is converging pins into an elastic places-in-the-cloud or PICs, with LAN, WAN, layer 2 and layer 3 switching integration.  2017 has also been an important inflection year for both our routing and 100 gigabit Ethernet products. I expect robust growth to continue ahead in 2018, together with our entry into 400 gigabit Ethernet next year. We also delivered many powerful software innovations in containerization, data analyzers, and our hybrid any cloud offering with Amazon, Microsoft Google, Oracle and Equinix, to name a few. Coupled with meaningful traction of CloudVision, we see this as an emerging software category for us in a couple of years. As we exit 2017, we have also surpassed a cumulative of a total 15 million cloud networking ports, and are now the number one market share leader in 100 gigabit Ethernet switching. Our focus on the top five verticals will continue this year. We foresee the balance across the verticals to be similar to 2017, where the cloud titans was the number one, followed by service providers, cloud specialty providers and Enterprise tied in a three way for second place, and financials at third place. Scaling my leadership team is also an important goal to adapt to all this growth. Many of you may recall that we hired John McCool in 2017 to drive hardware platforms and manufacturing as our Chief Platform Officer. Today, it's my pleasure to warmly and officially welcome Manny Rivelo as our Chief Sales Officer, who joined us this year in January. Manny brings seasoned general management and sales and SE leadership from F5 and Cisco. He comes at the right time for Arista. I have personally known Manny for 25 years and he\u2019s working closely with and for our Chief Customer Officer, Anshul Sadana to formulate international expansion and tailored go to market models for all our verticals. What is becoming crystal clear to me is that Arista is in the forefront of the movement to software driven networking, beyond even data center and cloud boundaries. Our ecosystem of customers and partners are united in supporting us in this migration. And I want to give a special kudos and thank you to all my dedicated Arista employees and my leadership team for the systematic, focused and results in the typical Arista way. Now, I'll turn it over to Ita for more financial specifics. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2017 results, and our guidance for Q1 2018, is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits and one-time tax charges associated with the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $467.9 million, up 42.7% year over year, and above our guidance of $450 million to $464 million. Services revenues represented approximately 13% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $153.8 million, or 33% of total revenue, up from 27% in the prior period. While some of this shift in geographical mix was driven by the timing of 945 related qualifications with our US customers, we also experienced healthy growth in our international businesses in the period. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 65.9%, up from 64.4% last quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance of 63% to 65%. The solid performance on gross margin for the quarter reflected a more favorable customer mix, with a higher contribution from our enterprise and another verticals, offsetting lower cloud titan revenues. Operating expenses for the quarter were $139.3 million, up significantly from $112.9 million last quarter. R&D spending came in at $96 million or 20.5% of revenue, up from $68.6 million in the prior period. This reflected increased NRE spending, combined with continued headcount growth. Sales and marketing expense was $33.5 million or 7.2% of revenue, down from $35.5 million last quarter, with reduced demo and sales costs. Our operating income for the quarter was $168.9 million or 36.1% of revenue. Other income expense for the quarter was a favorable $2.2 million, and our effective tax rate was 19.8%, reflecting the favorable impact of the increased international revenue mix discussed above. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $137.3 million or 29.4%.  Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.24 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share number of $1.71, up 64.3% from the prior year. For those of you focusing on our GAAP results, our GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in at 26.7%. This reflected the favorable impact of significant excess tax benefit on share based awards in the quarter, combined with the favorable geographical mix mentioned above, and offset by the inclusion of $51.8 million of additional tax charges associated with the recently enacted Tax Act. This share related excess tax benefits and the one-time tax charges, have been excluded from the non-GAAP tax rates discussed above. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $9.1 million for the quarter, and are also excluded from our non-GAAP results. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investment ended the quarter at approximately $1.5 billion. We generated $183.7 million from in-cash from operations in the December quarter. This reflects strong net income performance, combined with a decrease in supply chain related working capital, and deferred revenue amounts. DSOs came in at 49 days, up from 45 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of billings in the quarter. Inventory turns of 1.8 times, up from 1.7 in Q3. Inventory decreases were $306.2 million in the quarter, down from $332.3 million in the prior period. This primarily reflects reductions in raw materials as we continue to optimize our supply chain. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $34 million of inventory deposits recorded and other assets at the end of the quarter.  Our total deferred revenue balance was $515.3 million, down from $565.1 million in Q3. Our product deferred revenue balance declined in the quarter due to the expiration of prior period new product and new customer acceptance clauses. The 2017 year end product deferred revenue balance was essentially flat to 2016 levels.  Accounts Payable were 30 days, up from 19 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.9 million.  Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We are pleased with the strong execution underlying our 2017 financial performance, with 46% revenue growth, and 70% growth in earnings per share on a year over year basis. Looking forward to 2018, we are pleased with the - we believe that the demand drivers for the business remain strong, and we are well positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in cloud networking across our customer base. That said, we will face some tough comparables for year over year revenue growth as we move through 2018. And with this in mind, I would reiterate Jayshree\u2019s comments from last quarter with respect to top line growth moderating to a more typical mid 20s for the year. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix being the key driver of where we operate within this range. This assumes a positive outcome on the remaining legal matters, with no disruption to our supply chain. While we will remain cautious in relation to our spending ramp, we also expect that over time, our operating expense investments will gravitate towards our long term model of 20% R&D, 10% sales and marketing and 3% G&A.  We will adopt ASC 606 in the first quarter of 2018. We expect this new guidance will have minimal impact on our operating model. We will re-class a small amount of sales commissions from retained earnings to other assets in the first quarter of 2018. And going forward, our CloudVision deferred revenue amounts, will be reported as contract liabilities on the balance sheet. In addition, following the adoption of the Tax Act in December, we expect our go forward non-GAAP tax rate to range from 19% to 21%, reflecting the lower tax rate on our US business, partially offset by higher US taxes on foreign earnings. This represents our current best estimate of the impact, knowing that elements of the tax legislation are still being refined.  With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results, and excludes any non-cash stock based compensation impacts and any legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows. Revenues of approximately $450 million to $468 million, gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 32%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, with diluted shares of approximately $81 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $8 million for the quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz : Thank you. Good afternoon. So my question really is around the glide path for 2018 full year revenue growth of the mid 20s. How should investors think about the composition in terms of Enterprise? Will Enterprise still continue to be your top one or two vertical? Or will there be other changes with respect to the main verticals? And then within that, how important is routing to the enterprise as far as adoption? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Mark. I did try to say this in my script. We had an unusual bump in Enterprise for Q4. But just to go back on 2017, our number one vertical was cloud titans, and our number two vertical was tied between Enterprise, service provider and cloud specialty providers, and number three was financials. I pretty much expect the same mix in 2018. I can't exactly tell between two, three and four, how they\u2019ll go. They may be different in each quarter, but I fully expect cloud titans to be our number one vertical in 2018. So the mix will remain quite similar. And in terms of routing, routing is really a horizontal across all our verticals. This is a transition as you know that has been going on for two years. I would say there are two forms of routing. There\u2019s the heavy duty Flex Routing, which is largely for service providers, for Internet peering use cases. And there's more the layer 2, layer 3 switching, which frankly majority of our customers use. So routing is quickly becoming an option across our entire customer base. But in terms of heavy duty FlexRoute, what we've now seen is we've been steadily increasing our customer base. We\u2019re well over 200 customers in 2017, and I expect it to continue to be somewhere in the 15% to 20% of our new customer acquisitions. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask you I guess one question in two parts. One is related to 945. Can you just talk a little bit about, is there anything you can do to quantify that for us and also help us understand how 945 might have impacted the guidance. And then could you also talk about AI workloads and what you think your share there is? I know you guys own 25% share on 100 gig, but how are you doing in particularly the cloud titan AI workloads? Are you - do you feel like you have a higher share than what we see in some of the market data? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Welcome, Rod to Goldman Sachs. I\u2019ll take the first question and then punt it to my general counsel, Marc Taxay here. In terms of 945, we got some really good news on Valentine\u2019s Day yesterday that I\u2019ll let Marc elaborate on, that pretty much affirms the PTAB\u2019s decision to invalidate the 668 patent. But I think the patent you're talking about, the workaround is really the ACL patent, the 577. And we expected most of the testing and certifications, the simple ones to take two to four weeks, and the more complex ones to take 10 weeks. And because we ran into the holiday season, there were a couple of complex use cases that spilled into Q1 2018 that should have - should really impact our Q2, Q3, Q4 2018 revenue more than 2018 Q1 itself. So the certifications did take longer. I'm very comfortable that there's a light at the end of the tunnel in Q1, and most of the cases have been completed, but the complex ones will be completed in Q1. Marc, do you want to add to the legal update? Marc Taxay : Yes, sure. I think first of all, we were very grateful that the federal circuit affirmed the PTAB\u2019s decision yesterday to invalidate the 668 patent. So this was a very important step towards the 945 case. The other remaining patents that Jayshree was alluding to, the (indiscernible) patent, that as a reminder is also subject to IPR appeal. We won the IPR on that last year. We do feel good about that as well. But regardless of the outcome on that one, that patent expires on June 30. At this stage, despite the recent federal court decision and the PTAB decision, we still remain subject to the IPC order in the 945. So we continue to sell those redesigns. We will be seeking a suspension of the IPC orders based upon the recent 668 decision, at least with respect to the 668. But in the interim, we continue to sell the redesigns and we continue to move forward with the modification proceeding. Jayshree Ullal : So switching gears to AI workloads, as you know, Andy Bechtolsheim spoke about this at the technology conference. And we see this as a huge long term driver. It\u2019s still too early to talk about use cases in our cloud titans. Most of them are in experimental stage, but we are working very closely with storage vendors and NVidia and the network is clearly going to require more and more bandwidth. So 00 gigabit Ethernet workloads and in the future 400, will become an important requirement for the vast amount of data crunching and analytics required on AI workloads. Rod Hall : That\u2019s great. Thank you, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from Pat Newton from Stifel. Your line is open. Pat Newton : I guess recent commentary from your competitors is that they're addressing disruption in the routing market with routers architected to deliver cloud scale economics like the PPX or NCS. So do you view these solutions as cost and performance competitive with your R series? And then on the switching side, where competitors state their spine support routing functionality, can you comment on FlexRoute is fundamentally differentiated? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So first of all, I think like some of my competitors have noted, there\u2019s a routing transition and an architectural shift going on. I just want to be clear, it's been going on for three years, not one quarter. So legacy and core routers have been migrating to the spine for quite some time, and the Arista 7500R and 7280R has really become the gold standard for universal Leaf and Spine, both switching and routing. When you need that kind of cloud grade routing and performance, a large number of customers just love to go with that, both not just for the performance, but the unmatched availability and programmability.  In terms of products that are in the market, there's a lot of routers in the market. Arista is not a rather company. What we're really doing is moving to more and more use cases for routing and really peering use cases, peering across the Internet, across content, across the cloud. And the reality is, our Leaf Spine architecture has given us a real natural entry into that use case, because people have tested and qualified us so that they don't have to have a separate box or a separate functions. So I think the 7500R and 7280R really stand out for being not just great routing, but great switching. And as I said before, they\u2019re occupying multiple positions and places in the cloud for that. So there's not a like for like comparison. We think it\u2019s truly unique and differentiated and that's reflected in why we've been so well accepted this last year. Pat Newton : Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Suppiger with JMP. Your line is open. Eric Suppiger : Coming back to the 945 case, I thought you had introduced the workarounds in the September quarter. So I'm a little confused on the timing. Can you just walk us through the timing on what's stalling some of the titans? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So the first time we introduced it was absolutely the month of September. But maturity of the certifications, we did a little bit of it in September, but majority of the certifications were really completed in Q4, and then some of them spilled over to Q1. So September and Q1 was a few. Majority was Q4. Do you want to add anything? Eric Suppiger : And you said in September you had some business that fell out of the September quarter in light of that. Did that business close in the December quarter and these are additional projects on top of that? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, that's exactly correct. Those that we were testing in September, closed in Q4. The ones we couldn't finish were the more complex cases that we were not testing in September. Eric Suppiger : Okay. And those are going to probably fall into the Q1. Is that correct? Jayshree Ullal : The completion of the testing will absolutely be in Q1. The business may be Q1 or Q2 or Q3 or Q4. We can't say exactly. Eric Suppiger : All right. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. You indicated that Microsoft was 16% of revenue, which I think was the same number the previous year. And you're coming into the year, you suggested it would be less. So it sounds like it did better than you expected. Can you talk about why that was the case and what you're looking for in 2018? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No. I want to give a big shout out to Anshul Sadana, my entire Microsoft engineering team and REs in Seattle. We didn't expect Microsoft spending to be so strong. And although we are still in the early to mid-innings with many of our cloud titans, we really attribute this to two things. One is the success of Microsoft itself and their expansion in Azure. And the second is Arista\u2019s expansion into a number of use cases. So we find ourselves going into a number of tiers ranging all the way from the Sonic tier, which is their layer zero tier to doing our tiers, one, two, three, four, five. So I think the use cases grew for Arista and grew for Microsoft as well. So it was a win-win. Steve Milunovich : And your expectation for this year? Jayshree Ullal : Well, since I guessed poorly last year, I'm going to refrain from guessing. But I think they'll still be a 10% concentration customer. Steve Milunovich : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : My primary question is just on the enterprise side. Can you give us some granularity on some the rate of growth within that and how that splits domestically, internationally? But I was hoping you would give us some guidance on the 2018 tax rate, which I don't think I heard earlier. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Actually, why don\u2019t I let Ita answer the tax rate question while I rummage through some stuff for you, Alex. Ita Brennan : Yes. Alex, we said we think it will range from 19% to 21%, probably with 20% at the midpoint is a good place to start, given everything that we know now about the new rules. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So looking at the Enterprise sector, we just had a very strong sector, just like we did in Q3. Another lots of new customer - and it was almost neck to neck with Q3, record number of million dollar customers in both Q3 and Q4. CloudVision is becoming a very important piece of the Enterprise customer purchase. So as you know, this has been something we launched in 2016, but we are now well over 200. In fact our customer count exceeds 250 cumulatively. So I'm going to challenge the team to double that in 2018. And I think a large contribution to that is our Enterprise customers. In terms of international and domestic mix, Mark Foss is helping me here. International is higher. So I would say it's like a 60/40 split in the Enterprise, approximately. And that speaks to also the way our improved stats on international overall from 2016 to \u201917. Enterprise is clearly contributing there. Alex Henderson : Could you give us any sense of the rough magnitude of the growth rate on that or is that asking too much? Jayshree Ullal : I think I - I don't have the answers, Alex, but probably asking too much as always, but no problem. Thanks for trying. Alex Henderson : Thanks. Bye-bye. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffrey. Your line is open. James Fish : Great. Thanks for the question. Really appreciate it. I guess first you guys had a very strong free cash flow this quarter. How should we think about free cash flow going forward and the sustainability of these free cash flow margins? And then, any update to the 944 case at this point? Ita Brennan : Yes. So I'll take the cash flow question. I mean our free cash flow is going to pretty much follow our operating - our net income performance, right, and the performance of the business. There\u2019s very little CapEx and other adjustments that happen to that. So I think as the business performs, you'll see the free cash flow follow that pretty closely. There\u2019s services deferred revenue that will continue to grow. Obviously that generates cash off the balance sheet. But outside of that, it's pretty much well tied to the net income performance. And Marc, if you want to take the other question. Marc Taxay : Sure. So on the 944, there was a remand hearing in January. We believe that went well and we continue to feel upbeat about where we sit in that litigation. The judge is supposed to issue his decision in June, with the final decision by the commission in August, early August. James Fish : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Steve Enders : Hi guys. This is Steve Enders on for Alex. I was hoping we could maybe get a better understanding of what you\u2019re anticipating from a revenue glide path maybe over the year. How do you expect growth rates to kind of trend there? And also I just wanted to clarify, are you guys expecting a 400 gigabit adoption this year or is that more of a 2019 event? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Ita is going to take the first question. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think, Steve that you've seen the guidance for Q1. So obviously I think the comparables for Q1 have us growing 40% year over year, with the guide - the upper end of the guidance that we just gave you. I think for the rest of the year, we said kind of mid 20s for the total year. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any particular linearity to that that we can see at this stage. But that\u2019s kind of the two bookends, right? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And on 400 gig, I'll just step back and give you a little bit more of a tutorial. We saw that 10 gig had a very long tail for almost 10 years, and then many vendors jumped into 40 gig as did Arista. But 100 gig we believe first of all, has an extremely long tail, unlike 40 gig. So we think the relevant bandwidth points is really going to be 100 gig for a very long time, with the option to do 10 gig, 25 gigs or 50 gig on the service of storage IO connections. 400 gig is going to be very important in certain use cases, and you can expect Arista is working very hard at it. And we'll be as always first or early to market. The mainstream 400 gig market is going to take multiple years. I believe initial trials will be in 2019, but the mainstream market will be even later. And just because 400 gig comes by the way doesn't mean 100 gig goes away. They\u2019re really going to be in tandem. The more we do a 400 gig, the more we will also do 100 gigs. So they\u2019re really together. It's not either or. Steve Enders : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Given your response to Alex, I can't wait. I\u2019m just kidding, Jayshree. So going back to the delay by the - that you referenced last quarter and this quarter with respect to some of your cloud customers in connection with the workaround, can you give us a sense for the magnitude of the revenue that got displaced? I mean clearly from your comments, not all the revenue was displaced, but some of it in connection with the more complex use cases. Any boundaries you can put on that growth? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So Paul, I want to reiterate for everybody that not competitor displaced our revenue. Paul Silverstein : No. I don't mean to suggest competitor displacement, Jayshree. I just meant \u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So I want to be very clear on that. But it did take longer and it was really as we\u2019re going into some mission critical production sites in these complex use cases that the cloud operators and the cloud titans especially had extra testing in. so I would say, let\u2019s - roughly in terms of percentage, 20% of the use cases were complex and moved out. Paul Silverstein : Can you translate that for us in dollar terms? Jayshree Ullal : No. nice try. Paul Silverstein : If I may, you've been kind of update us periodically on the convertible landscape with respect to cloud in general. So my question to you is, has there been any changes, either in terms of competitive displacement among the web skill folks as well as your specialty as you call them your specialty providers, and either by other competitors or by any meaningful movement to white box solutions? And can you tell us - I think at your Analyst Day and periodically since, you've told us that your hyperscale folks, I think the number was 25% or thereabouts. Can you give us an update on what they were collectively for calendar \u201917? Jayshree Ullal : We have seen no appreciable change in competitive landscape in our cloud titan or cloud customers. So the answer to all your questions is really in one nutshell, no. we haven\u2019t seen any change. Paul Silverstein : And the contribution for \u201917 from the hyperscale? Jayshree Ullal : It was the number one vertical. The cloud titans was the number one vertical out of our five. Paul Silverstein : Okay. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research, your line is open. Stanley Kovler : Thanks for taking my question. Just to try on the qualification front one more time. 20% of workloads in clout titan being pushed out. That sounds like about 3% or so of revenue, if that makes sense. But the broader question on the cloud titans was that if you look at the spending of some of your cloud titan customers, some are doubling their CapEx spending. Do you expect to that to drive the international part of your business or will that be in the US? As we look at the business growing mid 20s, just curious how you think about the mix between US and international in that context. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think that\u2019s a really good question. So clearly - first of all, I\u2019ve made this point before and I\u2019d really like to make it again. I know it's easy to put a one to one correlation between the cloud CapEx and the Arista spend. I think it's important not to look at it so precisely because the cloud CapEx has a lot of components to it and the networking is a very small piece. And the second point I want to make is our visibility with our cloud customers, although getting better, is still much stronger for one to two quarters and nothing beyond that. So even though the cloud cap expense for 2018 may be great, we have much more visibility to what might happen in one of two quarters, not the rest - not the whole year. So I think it's really important to understand that. Now, the one thing I will say is, one of the things we noticed as a trend in 2017 that we think will continue in 2018 with all the cloud titans, is since they began a lot of their expansion early in the US, a lot of the later expansion will be in international sites. So we expect at least a 50-50, maybe even a higher contribution from international with our cloud titan/ Stanley Kovler : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Just check on something, whether or not your forecast for the first quarter reflects an assumption of some catch up from the titans, or whether that's an event you think is later in the year. And in terms of a big picture question, I wanted to see if you could comment on your thoughts about the pros and cons of Arista participating in the campus switching market. I assume that's something you're not that interested in, but just wanted to understand strategically how you would frame that. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Simon. So as you know, our first quarter is usually our toughest quarter. It\u2019s seasonally slow and our guidance reflects that. It doesn't cooperate cloud titans like it always does. But nothing unusual in that guidance. It's normal and we think any completion of certifications will not have an immediate impact on Q1, but will have a more gradual impact over the rest of the year. In terms of campus, I think one of the phenomenas I'm seeing is, and I tried to say this in my opening script, that the well-defined boxes and places in the network where you have a campus box, a data center box, a branch box, a core box, is really changing. And what our customers are really pushing us to do is look at campus as an extension of the cloud, or look at new drivers in the campus. And so while we have no intentions of participating at this time in any kind of traditional campus markets, we have every intention of disrupting the traditional campus market as currently defined. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to the international markets, and maybe can you help us understand - they\u2019re bouncing around a fair amount in terms of contribution right now. Can you help us understand how those - where you think those might end up? And also give us any insight as to which geographies and types of customers you're seeing internationally and how we should think about the evolution of your opportunities outside the US. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think I definitely look at the numbers for the year as a better way of looking at it. So if you look at it, we've got - we were at 27% international, which is up from our kind of typical 25% historically. I think that's a better way to think about it than some of the wings on the last couple of quarters, right. So I think we're seeing some good steady progress internationally. That business is growing well, like what I would call the in-region business, even if we carve out some of the cloud titan effects that we just talked about, right? The in-region business is growing well and it's still relatively small so you can see it be lumpy between APAC and Europe. But both are actually, if you look at it over time, growing at a faster rate than the US. James Faucette : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath : Good afternoon, Jayshree, Ita. I would like to get like a state of state from you in the sense of international and also telcos here in the US. At least our view is that's kind of your next phase of growth. So give us a state of state on how business is proceeding, how it sails. Any really interesting projects you could share with us in the international markets and also at the telcos. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. I think in international, we are doing very well in several countries. And in general, I would tell you we're acquiring customers faster internationally than we are in the US. I think 60% of our customer acquisition in 2017 was international. So the projects are many and the size of deal is smaller, just to put it bluntly, right? In terms of service providers, switching gears though, those are not small deals by any means and we view service providers in the midst of a transformation where their traditional traffic engineering is going to start looking more and more like cloud networks and resemble what we're doing with Ethernet and IP and Leaf and Spine.  But these Leaf Spine cloud architectures are now permeating the service providers. We\u2019re starting to see some big RFPs and we've experienced some wins in 2017. I think 2018 will be an important year. Ken Kiser, Jonathan and the entire team, is really working hard on this worldwide with Manny. And what we really see is that deterministic performance we\u2019re getting out of Lease Spine is going to transform the SP networks for many of the peering use cases. And this is a tremendous layer 2 and layer 3 opportunity for us. So we expect to see service provider contribute better in 2018 than 2017. Vijay Bhagavath : Okay. Thanks, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. A lot of questions already been answered, but - or asked and answered. But I want to go kind of back to the guidance and kind of how you're thinking about the flow through effect of deferred revenue as we progress through 2018. I can appreciate that you've communicated that you would have expected deferred revenue to decline here going forward. It looks like short term deferred was down 20 some odd percent sequentially. So I'm just curious of how we should think about that relative to the revenue expectations over the next couple of quarters. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean I think now that kind of the deferred balance, the product deferred balance is back in line with what we've seen historically and it\u2019s pretty much consistent with where we were at this time last year. We\u2019re not going to try to honestly guide the movements in the product deferred going forward. We\u2019ve kind of worked through the acceptances, et cetera, that we had with the - associated with the R theories that have caused it to move around so much. But I think we\u2019re through that now and it\u2019s just back to a normal kind of deferred level. So I'm not sure that we're going to fork out that as we go forward. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter : Hi. Thanks very much. I guess I just wanted to follow up on that last question. So was the step down in deferred sequentially? Was that consistent with what you guys were looking for coming into the quarter? And then also I assume that all of that R Series product revenue is largely out of the deferred number now. Is that correct? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean I think pretty much in line with what we were expecting coming in. a lot of it - a lot of what\u2019s left in the deferred revenue balance at this stage, a portion of that is going to be 945 qualification related, and then some other stuff. But kind of the concentration of R Series new product type stuff that was there during the year, that\u2019s definitely been processed at this point. George Notter : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from James Kisner with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open. James Kisner : Thank you for the question. Just going back to your comment, I understand your comment on tough comps in 2018. I just wonder if you could talk about whether you see any gating factors to your growth in 2018, whether it be external or internal, availability of optics, availability of silicon. CapEx, you\u2019ve been stretched and constraints and conversely, perhaps can you talk about any major screen factors that could lead to upside to your 25% growth forecast in 2018, and whether you would have any constraints to address potential upside opportunities. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : James, welcome to your first Arista call. No, we don't see anything major. We\u2019ve done a good job of planning and forecasting our inventory and from a supply chain perspective, there's been a lot of work that's gone on. With our top customers, we have a great deal of intimacy on the forecast and they let us know even before they book orders sometimes what kind of demand they expect. Of course it can change dramatically. But we feel good about the projects ahead and the opportunity ahead, and we're putting all the right plans in place for it. James Kisner : I guess a clarification there. I mean I'm looking at the growth and I\u2019m looking at reports in optics for example in 2018, and obviously they\u2019re going to be up a lot more than 25. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering if it's perhaps because switches are offloaded in advance of the optics. And obviously you\u2019re not all 100 gig, but there seems like quite a gap in the difference in volumes. Maybe you clarify that a little bit. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : So the layer one optics decisions aren't always made in conjunction with Arista\u2019s switching and routing. Sometimes they\u2019re together and sometimes they're entirely separate, like data center interconnect decisions. So you won't see a one to one correlation. That\u2019s - secondly, sometimes you\u2019ll only see a one to one correlation in our applications because they may already have acquired the optics from another vendor, or they may have failed. So that's one area where you really can\u2019t correlate a lot between the routers and the accessories. James Kisner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura/Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the mid 20% outlook for 2018. Starting from the 40%-ish number in the March quarter, that seems like an awfully sharp deceleration. I get it that we're not in the same 100G migration you don't have the buildup of 3500 to work with, but why might the market - why might you have written it so down that much? I mean CapEx is going up quite dramatically as was previously noted. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean, Jeff, I think if you look at the comparables for last year, I mean we really saw the spike in growth kind of the 50% plus kind of growth rate happened in the middle of the year, right? So I think Q1 is starting off at a slightly different base, right? And again this is our outlook as we sit here today. We haven't kind of looked at all of the information that we have. We feel good about that. It\u2019s a good, solid outlook for next year and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. So maybe it would be fair to say that you don't have the visibility beyond mid-year with some of the biggest accounts. So which is normal, so therefore take a pretty cautious view of how things might proceed beyond the window of visibility. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean it's really hard to plan out the linearity a year out, right? I think - let me go back to - if you asked Ita and me whether we'd have 50% growth increases in 2017, we certainly didn't forecast it. It came upon us suddenly because the cloud titans suddenly had a use case and application. So when we look at the overall year and when we look at how to plan the year, just like we did in 2017, we think a growth rate in the 20s to 30s with an average of 25% is a very, very good growth rate. It\u2019s not cautious. It\u2019s realistic, and if something really good happens beyond that, that's great. Or something really bad happens, we'll let you know. Hope is not a strategy. This is our best effort at predicting what that growth would be. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. I didn\u2019t catch the 50% growth either, property growth. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto from Gabelli. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto : Good evening, Jayshree and Ita. Good results as you finish 2017. Arista cash has grown to $1.5 billion and it generated strong free cash flow of over $600 million in 2017. How should investors think about the use of cash in the future? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean I think at this stage, Hendi, we're still in the mode of growing and investing in the business. So I think we look at that as something that will continue to generate and use for the business. Beyond that, we're not opposed to looking at some capital allocation stuff later on just philosophically. But it\u2019s too early, right? We\u2019re still - we\u2019re sort of relatively early stage, high growth company. So we think about that as cash that we\u2019ll hold for the business in the near term. Hendi Susanto : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : And I think you're going to continue to invest where we've always been strong in execution, which is our R&D and our go to market and systems engineers and sales and marketing. So we\u2019ll certainly put it to good use. And you saw us spending a lot more than you probably forecasted in Q4. Hendi Susanto : Got it. Thanks, Jayshree and Ita. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal LIani with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Tal LIani : Hi. Just a clarification on deferred. What\u2019s driving deferred down? Is it timing of revenue recognition following announcements of features, or maybe following approvals of the workaround? I\u2019m trying to understand if there is - there are two trends here. On one hand, you get the orders in an orderly manner, and on the other hand, there is like odd fluctuation because of timing of certain things. So if it's not it, if you can just explain what are the puts and takes in the differed revenues. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : I mean there's probably two factors, right? One is we're closing out on features, et cetera, that we needed to deliver and on acceptances that we had in contract. The R Series is over a year and in the market now. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of those close out. So we\u2019re not generating as much deferred revenue because of that. I think secondly, we were still qualifying some of these designer rounds in the fourth quarter and that did affect the linearity of invoicing and stuff. I think the underlying business is solid. It\u2019s more the timing of shipments billing and how it\u2019s long to the deferred. Tal LIani : So going forward, do you expect the deferred - I think you said normal level, but what I'm trying to understand is, going forward you would expect the deferred to go more in line with bookings kind of with the orders you're getting? If the orders go up and you can recognize, it goes up and vice versa? Or do you still have these backlog of things that need to be recognized because of timing of features and approvals? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No. I think it's more the deferred - product deferred revenue was never a topic of conversation prior to 2017. It was very much a factor of the new product features and new customers that we were engaging with in \u201917. Actually, under the new accounting rules, under 606, even a similar transition to that would not drive the same amount of deferred revenue going forward in the future. That guidance is very much geared towards an earlier recognition of revenue. So I think as we go forward, deferred revenue will be much less of a topic from a product perspective, and hence you\u2019ll see the services deferred revenue continue to grow. Tal LIani : Thank you. Chuck Elliott : This concludes the Arista Q4 2017 earnings call. I also want to mention that we've posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the investor section of our website. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to the first quarter 2018 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the release of its fiscal first quarter 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, industry innovations, our market opportunity and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter of 2018 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a good quarter, given the normal seasonality. We demonstrated our predictable profitable growth with non-GAAP revenue of $472.5 million, as we grew more than 40% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.66 with services contributing 13.7% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 67% of the total revenue, while the rest of the international theatres progressed steadily in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.4% in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. Our top ten customers included four out of the five verticals. Cloud titans contributed strongly in Q1 and ranked as our number one vertical; followed by enterprises at number two; service providers and cloud specialized providers pretty much tied at number three; followed by financial. Our new customer acquisition continues to be healthy, as we exceeded 5,000 cumulative customers this quarter, and we continued to perform well with Flexroute, our routing license; and CloudVision software customers as well. At Arista, we have always embraced open networking trends by designing our platforms with merchant silicon diversity, while using modern software to form differentiated cloud networks. On March 29, Arista introduced the latest datacenter fixed leaf models based on Broadcom's Trident 3 and Tomahawk 2 silicon. Arista 7050X3 and 7260X3 platforms run on the single EOS software image and CloudVision for operational consistency. Some of the key innovations include intelligent buffering and automated network load balancing, path and latency monitoring, new protocols such as segment routing and a fully featured VXLAN stack, high availability with hitless software upgrades, low-power 25-gig and 100-gig fixed system that are double the capacity of their predecessors and cloud scale performance with 12.8 terabit scale and 4.2 billion packets per second of packet forwarding. On OCP's event in March 2018 in San Jose, Arista demonstrated disaggregated EOS via collaboration with two key cloud partners, Facebook with Wedge 100 and Microsoft with SONiC. As many of you may know, we began our Microsoft journey back in 2015 or 2016 with SAI, Switch Abstraction Interface, via cold contributions to this initiative. This year, Arista and Microsoft expanded the SONiC initiative across the flagship Arista 7500 as the only modular chassis supporting Microsoft Management stack. Arista also supports EOS and Containerized EOS on Facebook's open Wedge 100. This allows customization of scripts for automating network operation flows. And in both of these cases, Arista's advanced EOS SDK is demonstrated in full action. This quarter, we also participated in routing interoperability at the MPLS + SDN + NFV World Congress event in Paris. We're gratified to be recognized for the first time The Forrester Wave for hardware platforms and SDN as a leader with a top score in both strategy and current offerings in Q1 2018. We're also proud to be recognized as one of the top ten employers in the Bay Area's Best Places to Work in the large employee category, ranked number nine out of 130 eligible companies. As I look at Q1 2018 and reflect on our start, I am pleased with our performance and the trajectory ahead. In particular, we are now well beyond the overhead and delays of customer certifications that we had been experiencing during the past three quarters, having successfully completed most of the certification. And in light of the recent IPC suspensions on the remedial orders of the 668 patent as well as the expiration of the 577 patent on June 30, we pretty much expect to return to normalcy in the second half of 2018 with respect to 945. And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for Q1 2018 financial details. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2018 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were $472.5 million, up 41% year-over-year and above our guidance of $450 million to $468 million. We were pleased with the overall demand in the quarter with particular strength from our cloud titan vertical. Service revenues represented approximately 13.7% of revenue, up slightly from prior quarters. International revenue for the quarter came in at $157 million or 33% of total revenue, consistent with the prior period. While some of this continued strength in international mix was related to deployments by our U.S. cloud titan customers, we also experienced healthy growth from our in-region international businesses in the period. Overall gross margin in Q1 was 64.4%, down from 65.9% last quarter but above the midpoint of our guidance of 63% to 65%. This reflected an anticipated return to a more typical customer mix for the first quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were $137.4 million, down from $139.3 million last quarter. R&D spending came in at $91.4 million or 19.3% of revenue, down from $96 million last quarter with reduced prototype spending, offset by head count additions. Sales and marketing expense was $36.2 million or 7.7% of revenue, up from $33.5 million last quarter, reflecting growth in head count. Our operating income for the quarter was $166.7 million or 35.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $4.2 million, and our effective tax rate was 21.5%. The higher than anticipated tax rate reflects updated guidance in relation to the recently adopted Tax Act. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $134.1 million or 28.4%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.7 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $1.66, up 79% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $7.1 million for the quarter and are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $1.7 billion. We generated $195.5 million of cash from operations in the March quarter. This reflects strong net income performance combined with overall improvements in working capital requirements. DSOs came in at 39 days, down from 49 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of billings and collections in the quarter. Inventory turns were 2.2 times, up from 1.8 times in Q4. Inventory decreased to $268.1 million in the quarter, down from $306.2 million in the prior period. This reflects reductions in both raw materials and finished goods, as we continued to optimize our supply chain. In addition, we maintained a further $24 million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets compared to $34 million last quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $456.1 million, down from $515.3 million in Q4. Product deferred revenue declined by approximately $50 million in the quarter with customers completing many of their 945-related qualifications. In addition, as part of our adoption of ASC 606, we reclassified approximately $19 million of software-related deferred revenue to other contract liabilities on the balance sheet. As we go forward, you should expect lower levels of product deferred revenue, given the relative maturity of the R-Series platform, completion of any remaining 945-related certifications and the adoption of ASC 606. As a reminder, any such decline in deferred product revenue is not, in and of itself, an indication of a change in the underlying demand trends of the business. Accounts payable days were 38 days, up from 30 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory received from payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.3 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We are pleased with the momentum of the business in the first quarter, with strong demand particularly from our cloud customers. As we look forward to the remainder of 2018, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in cloud networking across our customer base. Given some tough 2017 comparables, we believe that the current consensus for the balance of the year, which calls for year-over-year growth in the mid-20% range, remains relevant. Our gross margin guidance for the second quarter of 62% to 64% reflects an anticipated mix towards cloud revenues in the quarter. We now expect our go-forward non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, reflecting further guidance on elements of the recently adopted Tax Act. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impact and any legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows; revenues of approximately $500 million to $514 million; gross margin of approximately 62% to 64%; operating margin of approximately 32% to 34%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, with diluted shares of approximately $81 million. Please note that, based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $6 million for the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to focus on the 945 certification and just ask a couple of questions around that. Number one, is all the deferred revenue associated with those now released or is there still some deferred revenue balance associated with those certifications? I wanted to be clear on that. And then, my bigger question is, you guys had called out some project-oriented delays as a result of those certifications. Are those projects back online now or are you still ramping back to normal spending with some of those customers that were waiting to certify? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. I'll take the second one first and then hand off to Ita on the deferred piece. So I think having now completed majority of our certifications \u2013 and if you recall, I was explaining how some of the complex use cases took time. So we feel pretty good about that. In 2018, we are pretty much now starting to look at the impact of certifications to be very minimal in Q2 and virtually non-existent in the second half. So we're ramping back to new projects now. So the worst is behind us. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And then, just to take your first question, Rod, I think there is still some 945 certification-related deferred there, it's small. And then there are some other unrelated stuff, just normal kind of feature delivery type deferred that's in the balance sheet. So that number is now going to be much smaller, and it will rotate just based on features and value of features as we make commitments in particular contracts going forward. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just to follow up, I wonder could you guys comment a little bit on what you're seeing with respect to AI workloads and spending there. And do you think you have the majority of the networking in that market or do you find that there's quite a bit of competition around? Just curious how that's going. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, I think the whole AI space is very, very exciting. It's clearly in very early stages. In fact, just two weeks ago, we were on a road show with our partners : NVIDIA; and storage partner, Pure. And what I would say to that is clearly the importance of AI is to reduce cycle time. And that has a profound impact on the bandwidth performance, capacity and latency of networking. So we derive an indirect benefit as a result of the large amounts of GPU, but still very early stages, I would say, and experimental stages. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Given a lot of the news about privacy concerns and geopolitical trade wars and tensions, stuff like that, have you seen any change in behavior to your cloud spending or any of your customers either in a positive or a pausing manner? What I'm getting at is, are they looking at putting in some more of your product because of these concerns or some less, or waiting to figure it out and especially with the trade wars? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Oh, wow. Thanks, Jim. That's a heavy-duty question. I'm going to start to answer it, but I won't do enough justice. So, Anshul Sadana, our Chief Customer Officer, who's much more intimate with the cloud will give you more details. When we look at the whole security and privacy state, I think there's an element of how we work closely with our security vendors, an element of isolation and segmentation and a strong element of audit compliance and encryption and particularly since the cloud vendors are deploying a lot of datacenters. The encryption and the ownership of their fiber becomes a big deal. Anshul, you want to say some more? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Absolutely, Jayshree. The data protection in the cloud is very relevant, not so much with respect to the trademarks, but for things like GDPR or any local laws that exist. So, when you look at the cloud companies, the regions they're building out, you'll see that some of the regions are smaller and localized within Western Europe or one-off countries. That's all the impact that we see. And that's part of the cloud business that we're already in. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you so much for the details. It's appreciated. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Your line is open. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Two questions, Ita. You mentioned mid-20% growth is where you're comfortable for the year. Obviously, you grew 40% in Q1. Does this mean, in your second half, you're assuming some sort of deceleration from the mid-20% or do you expect that to be within that ballpark? And then, just one clarification. You said ASC 606 had like $19 million impact on deferred revenues. Did that help you in terms of revenue in the quarter? Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So, on the first one, I think the commentary was that for the balance of the year, but for the remainder of the year we would say we think the mid-20s is a reasonable way to think about the growth rate. Right? So not incorporating the Q1 growth rate. And then, on the ASC 606, it's really a balance sheet reclass. It's kind of on a technicality where we have some prepaid subscriptions and we're required to record it as a contract liability as opposed to deferred revenue, right? So, it's really just a relocation on the balance sheet from deferred to two other contract liabilities, so not flowing through the P&L. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Yes. Thanks very much. We've been hit by a raft of headlines from the cloud spenders over the last week or so, talking about big beats in their CapEx. It sounds like that is pretty closely tied to what is going on in their underlying business. So, CapEx for them ought to be growing faster in 2018 than it grew in 2017. It looks like you all are set to grow a little slower in 2018 versus last year. Can you help us bridge that gap? I understand from quarter to quarter things fluctuate. But over the course of the year, we would like to think that things would balance out a little bit. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Most certainly, Jeff. I do know cloud titans do have seasonal spending, and we have enjoyed a very strong partnership with many of them and continue to. Our heritage is undoubtedly and our forecast and our past, our present and our future is very much tied to cloud networking for all types of customers. I think what you should take away from this is, while we have a great dealer visibility to the near future, which is one or two quarters, the spending for the entire year or subsequent quarters involves a lot of moves and shifts, and networking is still a very small piece of their CapEx. So, we continue to understand those use cases. Anshul and the team are very intimately involved, and we have no reason to believe that we aren't technically or business-wise in strong partnerships. But we will only know more, say, for Q4 around Q2 or Q3. So, that's what's really hard to predict and we try not to. Sometimes they don't know and that's why we don't know either. Anshul, do you want to add anything more to that? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Absolutely. I'd want to remind everyone, we've discussed this in the past that for the cloud companies, a datacenter build-out or a resell build-out is a two-to three-year project. And when the networking components land and we see the product bookings and revenue is not exactly in the same month or the same quarter, the lag could be as much as 18 months for the bigger regions. That's why it's very hard for us to forecast this. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. But let me remind you, Jeff, that cloud was strong from a momentum and from a demand perspective in Q1. So, I think \u2013 It's typically strong, and we saw that again this quarter. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, maybe to probe on that a little bit. You talked about a... Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'm sorry. We're just going to limit it just to one question, if you don't mind. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Oh, you got me, Charles. You got me. Go ahead. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Steven Enders - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Steve Enders on for Alex. I was wondering if you guys had seen any change in mix of Top of Rack switches and spine within your web scale customers over the past few years or how that's trended. And how does that also compare in the service provider segment? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We don't see appreciable change. Obviously, the spine and routing has given us more use cases in the cloud and service provider. But the leaf gives us a lot of ports. So, overall, not much different. Steven Enders - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cohen and Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : I'll keep it simple... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Paul, you're sounding very muffled. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. We can't hear you, Paul. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : (22:27). Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We can't hear you. Can we skip him and go to the next? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Can we come back to you, Paul? We need better quality. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We can't hear you. You're very muffled. Let's get \u2013 let's fix that line, and we'll come back to you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And good quarter out of the gate, guys \u2013 I guess, ladies and guy. Help me think about \u2013 when you talk about the mid-20s for the remainder of the year, including the second quarter, can you help me think on a \u2013 if I look at it from a vertical standpoint, which verticals you think can outperform that bar versus underperform that bar? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I don't think that we're going to try to do that. I mean, obviously, there are a number of very different scenarios as we move through the year where we'll see strong demand in some cases with others. We've set our guidance based on a number of different potential outcomes, but I'm not going to go and try and lay out a single case here. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Ittai. We'll try to do our best going forward. But as you know, some of these verticals are very lumpy. For example, we may do really well in one quarter with service provider or really well in enterprise if we win a large number of enterprise customers. So, in general, all of them are doing well and contributing double digits in terms of segments. So, we hope they all have the possibility of growing... Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Can you give a little bit of an update on how enterprise is going for you as that's important kind of in the future? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah \u2013 no, I think, clearly, it was our number two vertical in Q1. And we tend to pull out the enterprise from financials. But if you added the financials, it would have been pretty close to our number one vertical. I would say we continue to do very, very well in the enterprise. Customers are incredibly frustrated and seeking an alternative both for quality and innovation reasons. The size of enterprise opportunities always starts small, and there is a long testing period, but we're pleased with our performance. And our customer gain in Q1 was very strong just like it was in Q3 and Q4 last year. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Very good. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to see if you could touch on where we are in the 100-gig cycle? That seems to be a question we get a lot from investors in terms of Arista's prime mover or first-mover advantage there. I mean, are we in the third inning, the fourth inning? Sorry to use a baseball analogy. But how should we actually think about Arista's momentum there with respect to 100-gig? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, if you use the cricket analogy, we're not even in the first inning. But if you use a baseball analogy, I would say we're still between the first and second innings. I think 100-gig is going to prove to be a very strong requirement, not only because we were the first mover last year, but we'll continue to be the first mover for many forms and flavors of it. It's important to understand it's not one product. It's going to permeate the entire cloud networking. And as we start to move more 25-gig and 50-gig into the downlinks with storage and compute, the need for 100-gig moves into the spine, into the datacenter interconnect, into the routing flavors. And so, we continue to believe that we will have large share and build upon our first mover advantage. And we also believe that the arrival of 400-gig next year will only make us stronger in 100-gig. So, the two will go in tandem. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go on the gross margin line and understand, I think, this quarter, looking at the guidance of 62% to 64%, that would compare to 63% to 65% guidance ranges over the next \u2013 or the last couple of quarters. It looks like your product gross margin came down a little bit. So, just curious of kind of what's changing there, if there's anything within the mix or assumptions there that resulted in a little bit of a lower gross margin assumption. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest driver still for our gross margin is kind of \u2013 within that 63% to 65% range is going to be customer mix, right? And as we head into Q2, we believe we will have a heavier cloud, so large customer base mix in Q2 and that's causing us to be a little more cautious around the gross margin guidance \u2013 on the gross margin outlook. So, it's really a customer mix. But actually, I think the 63% to 65% for the year, we still feel good about. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Good evening, and thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on seeing strong sales in Q1 and enterprise sales. I have heard market commentaries that despite of strengths in Arista's enterprise sales, Arista is still having low penetration among enterprises. So, Jayshree, would you be able to share insight into opportunities, outlook and the current state of enterprise penetration for both routing and switching? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Hendi. I would have to agree with you that Arista can improve its penetration in the enterprise. It's a huge opportunity for us. And even though we're doing well, we could do even better. Our penetration is both in switching and routing, so we're not seeing low penetration in either. I think our penetration in switching is stronger than routing because routing, especially for the scale of capability we offer, tends to be favored by the larger service providers and cloud providers. But I would say, in general, I would like to see Arista do better, but we're doing very well. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Hendi. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on the gross margin guidance, let me get back to that a little bit. So given the cloud vertical is supposed to be kind of the fastest growing and largest piece, when do we expect the margins to actually increase given the hyperscale guys typically buy the higher end products? Or I guess what am I missing there in terms of the mix dynamic? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, if you look historically, the mix factor has tended to be, if we have a lot of cloud or large customers, then obviously they have better and more competitive pricing and that tends to drive a lower gross margin. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Just to clarify what Ita said, I couldn't agree more, Mitch. Our cloud gross margins are driven by volume; and volumes drive lower prices and therefore lower gross margins to us. So our cloud titan margin is significantly below the corporate average. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Right. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I want to just ask about efforts to continue to expand the customer base both domestically and internationally, kind of the progress we're making there. One of the things that we've been seeing is that there continue to be what seems to be at least to us somewhat extended lead times on delivery. But I'd like to hear kind of how you're thinking about that? What the progress has been and how we should think about opportunities going forward? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, James. You may remember, I said we hired Manny Rivelo, and the specific goal here especially was to help with international expansion and enterprise. I think we're both investing very well in that and expanding in certain verticals. The M&E vertical is a particularly strong one for us. We just came out of a strong network broadcasting show. But I think we can do even more in the international theaters. As you can see, our ratios and percentages have changed by 5 to 10 points in the last few quarters, but we can do even more. So there's no denying that, similar to the last answer I gave, that Arista's opportunity and execution in enterprise can be even stronger. But as you also know, enterprises are risk averse and only in the last year, I would say, they have started to take Arista seriously. So I would ask you all to be patient in seeing the results just as I'm having to be. But having said that, I fully agree that especially some of the high-performance verticals are going to be strong for us, and I expect to see enterprise continue to be a strong vertical for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : One just point of clarification. Can you update us on the number of routing customers that you had in the quarter? And then, secondly, you talked a little bit about the impact of deferred revenues from the deals that were certified. Can you talk a little bit about what happened to your backlog? Did you have many deals in backlog that were a function of getting qualified and has the backlog come down now that you are qualified from the software changes? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Erik, I'll take the last piece first. I mean, we don't disclose backlog. So we're probably not going to get into that. I think our comments are \u2013 we did say that we felt good about momentum in the quarter and we felt good about the demand across the business in the quarter. But we're not going to actually disclose the backlog numbers. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, I agree with Ita on that. And to answer your question on FlexRoute customers, I think I told you the year-end number last year was over 200. And rather than giving you quarterly numbers, we did do well this quarter. Let me just leave it as I think we're going to double this year. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Erik. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. First, I'd like to just clarify. Did you say you expected a mid-25% type growth rate in the remainder of the year or did you say that you expected the mid-25% type growth rate for the full year? I'm not sure I followed the exact language there. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, for the remainder of the year. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Remainder of the year? Great. Then, the question I had for you is you've had pretty spectacular growth internationally. It's up in the 80% to 120% range, if I do my math right off of the comments you made about the percentage, 67% in U.S. in the quarter, which implies about 120% growth in the international arenas. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is that enterprise business that's driving that? Is that service provider? Is it cloud growth from the cloud customers in North America moving to international projects? What's behind that, please? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good question, Alex. Thank you. If you will recall, we started to make a lot of international investments \u2013 when was it? 2015 to 2016 in that timeframe. And I think we're \u2013 18 months to 2 years later, we're starting to see the return on that investment. And not surprisingly, it mirrors our five verticals in the domestic. So, some of it is cloud, but we're pleased with the traction we're seeing both in Tier 2 service providers as well as enterprises. So \u2013 and global financials is a good chunk of it, too. So, the only vertical that probably there isn't nearly as much of internationally is Tier 2 cloud providers. They exist more in the U.S. The Tier 2 service providers and cloud providers end up being one and the same for many international customers. So, that should give you a flavor. And so, I think the increased performance is directly correlated to good execution and good planning 18 months ago. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Good job, Anshul and Manny. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : Jayshree, can you hear me now? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, you're much better. What happened there? Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : I don't know. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: You sounded like you've been gagged. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : I'll keep it simple. Any change in the pricing environment and in the competitive landscape, both with respect to commercial merchant vendors like Cisco and Juniper, et cetera and with respect to white box solutions introduced by any of your customers? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'll keep my answer simple. No change in pricing. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : And no change in competitive landscape? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: The normal aggression in competitive landscape. No change. Just continued aggression. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : Jayshree, I apologize. But I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. You're not seeing any incremental pressure from Cisco or others, including white boxes? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Hold on. I'll separate the white box question. I am not seeing incremental pressure from my competitors except the normal aggression that I've seen over the last several years and quarters. Specific to white box, this is a customer strategy, not a competitive pressure strategy. As you know, we launched Containerized EOS, and we're fully committed to working with our customers on consumption models that can be virtual, container or physical. So, nothing to do with competition. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : But, Jayshree, I appreciate those are customers, but it translates into the same thing, right? To extend, more and more of your customers go to white box solutions that takes revenue away from you that you could have otherwise accessed. And so, again, I apologize. I just want to make sure. You're not seeing any incremental uptick of white box solutions by your customers? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Just \u2013 again, I am not seeing any difference in competitive behavior due to white box. And white box adoption, or rather disaggregated EOS, I'm not seeing any shift or change. The same as I told you before. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : All right. I'll pass along. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, thanks, Paul. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, ladies. Good quarter. Is Arista winning routing deals as mainly direct replacements today of your competitors, or is it mainly new footprint wins? And, Jayshree, you talked last quarter about disrupting the campus and I think we've gotten a ton of questions around how you're going to do that. Any \u2013 can you elaborate what the plans are there? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. James, thank you for the question. So, on the routing question, as I said before, the first sign that the router market has been going through some tough times is the actual market has been shrinking. And I think part of the reason that it's been shrinking is many of my competitor vendor or peers have been talking about an architectural shift. I think it's a shift that's been going on for three to five years \u2013 the last three years in switching. And now, more on the switching side of LANs, we've been incorporating routing for some time to come. Nothing new there. The new change is in the white area side, where more and more of the interfaces are moving to ethernet from traditional SONiC or T1 or ATM type of interfaces. In terms of new footprint versus existing, for us, it's all new. It's net new, right? And what we see in some cases is a customer is looking at a specific routing use case for peering or edge or core and still keeping their legacy routers. And if it's a complete greenfield opportunity, then it's brand new footprint, both for the use case and ourselves. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And then, the campus? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: On the campus, I think I said this before and I will continue to maintain, Arista does not plan to participate in the traditional campus. As things evolve in the campus and they become more and more akin or aligned with Arista's different value-add and differentiated capabilities, we're open to that. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, James. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about what happened or what's going on in the cloud vertical. I'm wondering if you experienced any sort of, I guess, we'd call catch-up spend in the March quarter or your expectations for the June quarter due to the pause while they were doing the certifications. If that was the case, can you quantify it? And if it wasn't the case, can you help us understand why there wouldn't have been some pent-up demand? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Simon, I wouldn't call it catch-up spend. I think we were hurt by the three quarters. We were harmed in some fashion by slowing down our certifications. And while the cloud titans waited patiently and completed the certification, they're always still a vendor and I'm sure they bought other gear as well during that time. So I'd say we are back to a new normal business now where we've completed the certifications and now they can deploy Arista more in all of the use cases without having to worry about certifications. So, Anshul, do you want to add something there? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. The compute and storage build-outs in the cloud are happening at a steady pace in Q1, for sure. And you can see that as well for our products. In addition to that, nobody has asked so far on the call, but the good news is the cloud customers are no longer constrained on these 100-gig optics. But really not related to our certification. It's just that the rest of the components are also freely available. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, I guess, if there wasn't some catch-up, does this sort of mean that there's opportunities for you to continue registering good sales? Basically, we won't see a pause in the coming quarters? So, steady as she goes now? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Simon, the way I look at it \u2013 and, Anshul, correct me if I'm wrong, is the pauses in the past. Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's correct. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And the present and the future look bright. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you for taking the questions. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Anshul, I wanted to ask you. How sticky are the cloud titan customers? I think there's a perception that there's really no loyalty on their part. And if somebody comes in with a better product that they'd fairly quickly switch or at least in the new build-outs they'd go a completely different direction, which given that you've got a high share, could not favor you. But you've worked with these guys for a long time. I know you're expecting to stay ahead. But what's your sense of what the loyalty is and how difficult it would be for them to move to a different vendor? Anshul Sadana - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. So, that's a loaded question. But I would say the stickiness is not in a given hardware configuration, the stickiness is with the software, how they automate, how they integrate and operationally. And I do believe the stickiness with Arista EOS is very, very strong. And this is not a customer base that is using a product that we ship as a standard product. This is a customer-base that customizes it along with us and for a reason. And this is not a market where someone shows up next day with a cloud that is somewhat similar or maybe one month ahead of someone else, saying I'm ready now. That's not what convinces these customers. What convinces them is something that will solve their day to day problems on automation, or integration, or routing or datacenter interconnect, and I don't believe that the stickiness \u2013 the light stickiness you referred to is actually true. It's a very strong stickiness with these customers, but again tied to the operating system and their automation stack, not just the hardware. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Anshul. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jayshree, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the innovation you're driving on the disaggregator software solutions with the hyperscaler. So, just wanted to see if you can help me think about the road map of monetization of those and is there applicability of those disaggregated solutions beyond the hyperscaler customers? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure \u2013 No, thanks, Samik. The hyperscalers are most advanced in adopting these kind of disaggregated solutions because you really need developers and development engineers. So, it's more a core development. And therefore, it takes joint work from both sides and joint engineers. In terms of monetization, obviously, we work with them closely to monetize both the work we're doing and also other use cases that tie into that. In terms of use cases outside of the cloud titans, I would say they're single-digit customers. There are very few that have the capability and the investment to do it. But certainly, they're very open when they come to that category and I work with them. But I would say a select few service providers and the large cloud type moves are probably the only ones who have shown both the willingness and the capability. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Kelleher from Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Most have been asked and answered. Just could you tell us how many 10% customers you have had in the quarter? And I know, at the beginning, you mentioned something about customer concentration. How many top customers were so much represented, if you could just reiterate that, that would be great? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Mark, we don't talk about 10% customer concentration in the quarter, but we certainly let you know at the end of the year. What I did say for the quarter is that there were five verticals, and four out of the five verticals contributed to our top 10 customers, which was cloud titan, enterprises, specialty, cloud providers and service providers. Financials is not in our top 10 customers. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: So you can't give us anything on customer concentration in the quarter? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's what I gave you in my opening remarks, so... Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. I guess, I was curious about linearity in the quarter, a 39-day DSO calculation. And I think you guys are a little odd in that the mix of cloud titans, I understand, is a big driver on that DSO number. They tend to have longer payment terms, if I remember correctly. And so, you had an increased mix of cloud titan revenue, yet the DSO calculation is at all-time lows. I'd love to know what's going on with linearity. And can you kind of walk us through the moving parts there? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think, if I think about the quarter, the linearity was reasonably consistent, right? We didn't see anything particularly different in the quarter. I mean, the customer mix is a driver. And that will be kind of varied throughout the quarter depending on the quarter. But in terms of overall linearity, I mean, it was pretty consistent. It's a linear business, right, generally on a quarter-by-quarter basis. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Got it. So did you guys do better then on collections? Was that the motivator for the big drop in DSOs? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. It's timing of billings, I would say. I think if I think back to Q4, there were some service renewals that happened at the end of the quarter that would've been sitting in AR and we're... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Q1 wouldn't have been affected by that. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Q1 wouldn't have been affected by that. So you could parse across this, like, a lot of different reasons as to why it moves around a little bit, right? And, obviously, we do that as we drive the collections numbers. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Jayshree. I'll ask a question and you'll yell at me like the tesla coil and I'm going to be famous after that. So I'll ask the question. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Tal. I can't wait to hear the question. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm going to ask you. Just I want to understand what happened last year in 2Q and what happened this year in Q1, and I'll ask it in a certain way. If I look at Q2 \u2013 I don't have a problem with growing 25% Q2, Q3, Q4. So Q3 and Q4, the 25% year-over-year translates into normal sequential growth rates. So that means you have tough comps, so the year-over-year goes down, but on a sequential basis it's normal. Q2 is too low because it translates into 7% growth \u2013 your guidance is 7% growth sequentially, and that's the lowest growth you've had before. And that means that maybe there was some concentration in Q1, maybe some orders fell into Q1 instead of Q2. I'm trying to understand, first, going back to last year, Q2 was giant, right? The 50% \u2013 suddenly accelerated to 50%. Let's go back and revisit what happened then that caused it and what's happening now in Q1 and is there any part of it that is related to product launches? Meaning, the 7500R, and that's why we see this slowdown maybe into Q2 \u2013 not slowdown, but just lower than seasonal sequential growth. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, exactly. I think they're all getting a little spoiled, Tal, when I happen to start defending our growth rates at 7% off a very large base to be too low. I think you are right to point out that we enjoyed a tremendous amount of confluence of 7500, 100-gig and routing combined with the law of large numbers. I think we're reflecting our best efforts at a very good Q2 guidance and a very good year, if we execute on all fronts. But remember, if you go back to 2015/2016, we had quarters that were at 7% growth. They're much lower numbers. So I'll try not to disappoint you, Tal, but you should be pleased and proud of us. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : By the way, this was just the way to open the question. So by no means, no complaints. But if I could go back \u2013 it's not a second question, just go back to it, can you talk about any concentration of the last four quarters of a new product in the 7500R, the routing. Does it play a big role in this acceleration of growth and now, after four quarters, it's slowing down? Or was there something else that caused this giant growth in the last four quarters? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: The giant growth was a combination of routing 100-gigabit and good cloud spend. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And then, the enterprise has kicked in. Everything happened perfectly. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So if everything happens perfectly, you're right to expect more from us. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: All right, Tal. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Hey, good afternoon, Jayshree, Ita. My question, Jayshree, is a bigger picture question which is, as the growth rate starts trending in line to investor expectations, any thoughts on M&A and inorganic strategies, put the balance sheet to work, perhaps level up and then look to chase growth inorganically? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah \u2013 no, good question, Vijay. I think we have been \u2013 I have been personally spending a fair amount of time on strategy and to be thoughtful about this is important. If you just go do an M&A and it doesn't integrate well into our EOS, you can actually set yourself back when you're a fast growth company. But if you pick the right adjacencies that work with our DNA, work with our culture and actually add upon our growth, that could be a positive. So, we haven't ruled that out. We continue to look for them. And as you know 90% of M&A activity fails. So, we want to be in that 10% that make it, so it's good feedback and good question and... Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, Jayshree... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: ...one we keep getting. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Vijay. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. That was our last question. This concludes the Arista Q1 2018 earnings call. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Business and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter of 2018 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had a record Q2, surpassing the $500 million mark. We exceeded our guidance comfortably with a non-GAAP revenue of $519.8 million as we grew more than 28% year-over-year despite tough comparisons from 2017. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.93, with services contribution at 14.4% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 73% of our total revenue, while the rest of the international theaters performed reasonably well. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.5% in a dynamic industry, exceeding our forecast due to customer mix. In terms of vertical trends, our top 10 customers included all five verticals. Cloud Titans contributed strongly in Q2 and ranked as our number one vertical, followed by enterprises and cloud specialized providers at number two, and financials and Tier 1, Tier 2 service providers tied for third place. Our new customer acquisition continues to be brisk and our million-dollar customers continue to be healthy as well. And we're especially pleased with the software and services acceptance with CloudVision customers. In terms of new introductions in Q2, we had an Analyst Day on May 7, 2018. Arista introduced our formal entry into the campus market with our Spline products and the Cognitive Management Plane architecture. And so, you might be thinking why did we enter this market. And the simple fact is our customers have been asking us to do so for some time. They have been deploying Arista products in campus use cases already to take advantage of Arista EOS quality and our state-driven software architecture. Overcoming the legacy three-tiered model from the market incumbents, the Arista X3 Spline is another example of disrupting the status quo. We're collapsing the aggregation and co-layers into a single tier. Chassis and fixed form factors are now available in Q3 2018 with wire speed Layer 2, Layer 3 switching rates and a cognitive suite of campus control, such as high resilience, secure segmentation and scale options for different range of protocols for L2, L3 and L2 over L3. The Arista Cognitive Campus also works with a diverse suite of edge devices including third-party. Today, Arista is also announcing its first acquisition, Mojo Networks, to expand into the Cognitive WiFi edge. We believe, the cloud-managed Cognitive WiFi is a very natural complement to our next-generation campus and cloud networking portfolio. I want to take this opportunity to warmly welcome Rick Wilmer, the CEO of Mojo Networks; and Pravin Bhagwat, Founder and CTO of Mojo; as well as the entire Mojo team to the Arista family. This transaction will close in Q3 2018, and I expect this to be accretive in 2019. At the core of our campus strategy is our powerful Cognitive Management architecture, whereby by the network auto discovers connected devices, applications and streaming data. CMP, based on CloudVision, assesses profile-based parameters such as configlets, bandwidth, packet size, inter-packet gap, open ports, white lists, et cetera. I could go on and on, but I would like to invite our chief guest, the Chief Technology Officer of Arista, Ken Duda, and our Senior VP of Software Engineering to say a few words. Ken? Kenneth Duda - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree. With the CloudVision Cognitive Management Plane, Arista is fundamentally advancing the way networks are operated and managed. CloudVision gathers all network state to a single place, keeping historical information as long as the customer wants it and analyzing and learning from all of that state. Operators enforce network-wide policy centrally, and CloudVision autonomously ensures that policy is implemented correctly across the entire network, plugging any compliance issues and creating workflows applied on approval to bring devices back into full compliance. What sets CloudVision apart is the confidence that it brings; confidence that things are working and working the way you expect. So you can now imagine how delighted we were to integrate Mojo Networks technology. Mojo pioneered Cognitive WiFi, in which WiFi state streams from access points to a centralized open source data store for analysis. By itself, it's a big help for network operators, helping with capacity planning, upgrades, troubleshooting performance issues. But in combination with CloudVision, it's even better. We can now extend CloudVision's reach enterprise-wide from the WiFi client across the campus to the enterprise data center and all the way to the cloud. This gives CloudVision customers a single pane of glass through which they can see everything going on, end-to-end, through their network. They can use one system that both ensure security compliance for physical switching and also generates alerts about WiFi connection issues. They can apply the same security policies to network edge, whether that edge is wired, wireless or virtual. They can monitor for unauthorized or misbehaving IoT devices, again, wherever and however connected. But at a higher level, our campus strategy is very simple. We're bringing the benefits of Arista's data center switches to the enterprise campus. These benefits are high-quality, trouble-free devices, a single software image across all switches for consistency and simplicity of operations and cognitive management, lowering operational costs through automation and providing advanced compliance visibility and telemetry features. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Your passion and enthusiasm on technology is always infectious. So I want to get that CMP right now and install it at home. We are witnessing an architectural shift in the campus that's really similar to the data center migration. When you look at what we're doing, it's an important step to what's taking these silo places-in-the-network, or PINs, of yester years to the cloud-first strategy with PICs, or places-in-the-cloud, as an important evolution to our customers. During this time, we remain committed to our HPE/Aruba partnership for mutual customers and to also promote open and multi-vendor interoperability. In Q2, we also introduced an exciting programmable product, the Arista 7170. The new 7170 Series is bringing a new generation of programmable packet processors with 64 ports of 100 Gigabit Ethernet, all in a single, fixed leaf form factor using a new merchant silicon vendor, Barefoot Networks, to make this possible. Traditionally, building such a chip that was both programmable and extremely fast wasn't so doable without trade-off. But with the Arista 7170, this defies tradition. It's integrating a suite of capabilities that previously ran on a host or VM or NIC into single, one rack unit switch. Examples of this programmability include advanced Layer 4 to Layer 7 features, tunnel termination, traffic filtering, network address translation and deeper packet inspection. The 7170 embodies Arista's EOS cognitive features at scale with modern P4 language. Use cases include tunnel scaling and multi-tenant data center, applying network security segmentation, real-time network telemetry, time-stamping, visibility and packet capture. As I look at our progress in Q2 2018 and in fact step back and reflect on the first half of 2018, I'm pleased by our progress on many fronts as we have moved from point products to software-driven cloud platforms with best-of-breed capabilities. We're gratified by the continued recognition from Gartner as the leader in their Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking for the fourth consecutive year, as well as Forrester's (10:15) Wave Leader in the Hardware Category with the top score. Arista was also recognized by Forbes as a Global 2000 Company for the first time in June 2018. Clearly, we're one of the fastest growing networking companies in recent history achieving $2 billion in annual revenue run rate with profitability metrics. I'm definitely excited by our future ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for more financial specifics. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 2018 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and impairment of our private company equity investments and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $519.8 million, up 28% year-over-year and above our guidance of $500 million to $514 million. We were pleased with overall demand in the quarter, with ongoing strength from our cloud titan vertical. Service revenues for the quarter were approximately 14.4% of revenue, up from prior periods and reflecting higher renewal activity. International revenues for the quarter came in at $142 million or 27% of total revenue, down from 33% in the prior period. The lower international mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily reflected the timing of some cloud deployments and the inclusion of some larger in-region EMEA deals last quarter. Our international base is still relatively small and will experience some volatility on a quarterly basis as the business develops. Overall gross margins in Q2 were 64.5%, up from 64.4% last quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance of 62% to 64%. This outperformance versus guidance primarily reflected increased leverage on our fixed cost base in the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were $143.9 million, up from $137.4 million last quarter. R&D spending came in at $92.3 million or 17.8% of revenue, up from $91.4 million in the prior period with increased head count and related expenses. Sales and marketing expense were $39.9 million or 7.7% of revenue, up from $36.2 million last quarter, reflecting increased marketing and demo-related expenses. Our G&A costs included some legal and accounting fees associated with the Mojo acquisition announced today. Our operating income for the quarter was $191.2 million or 36.8% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $6.9 million, and our effective tax rate was 21.4%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $155.7 million or 30% of revenue. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.8 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $1.93, up 44% from the prior year. Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at $3.6 million for the quarter. In addition, we recorded a $9.1 million impairment of our private company equity investments reflecting a valuation adjustment based on our recent funding round. Both of these amounts are excluded from the non-GAAP results discussed above. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. We generated $130.6 million of cash from operations in the June quarter. This reflects strong net income performance, offset by changes in working capital requirements. DSOs came in at 46 days, up from 39 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of billings and collections in the quarter. Inventory turns were 2.7 times, up from 2.2 times in Q1. And inventory decreased to $245.4 million in the quarter, down from $268.1 million in the prior period. This reflects reductions, primarily in finished goods, as we continue to optimize our supply chain. In addition, we maintained a further $25.3 million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets, compared to $24 million last quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $448.6 million, down from $456.1 million in Q1. Product deferred revenue declined by $15 million in the quarter, with customers completing final 945 related qualifications. At this point, we believe we've reached a somewhat normalized level of product deferred revenue. And while the underlying transactions will cycle on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the magnitude of the balance should stabilize. Accounts payable days were 26 days, down from 38 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.7 million. Now, turning to guidance. As we look forward to the remainder of 2018, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in cloud networking across our customer base. Our revenue guidance for the third quarter is consistent with our previous outlook which caused a mid-20% revenue growth for the second half of the year. The operations team is currently working to understand and attempt to mitigate any potential gross margin headwinds related to the trade tariff announcements. We would ultimately love to pass on any unremediated cost to customers. We announced earlier today that we're acquiring Mojo Networks. This represents a small, but strategic transaction which we expect to play an important role in our overall expansion into campus. We're just beginning the business and accounting integration and the acquisition will be recorded in our financials for the third quarter. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and any legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits, is as follows : revenues of approximately $540 million to $552 million; gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 32% to 34%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, with diluted shares of approximately 81.1 million. Please note that based on our current outlook, we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $6 million for the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Your first question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Congrats on the quarter here and congrats on the deal as well with Mojo Networks. I'll just keep it to one question, as requested. I guess maybe just to start off, can we talk about what you're seeing in terms of traction in the campus and where we are with the enterprise investments and sales buildup for the campus? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, James. As you know, if you were here in May, we announced a vision and we said products would really be in second half. And as you rightly point out, a lot of the interest in the campus is directly tied to enterprise customers. Many enterprise customers have already been using us in the data center with our EOS and want to have a common Spline architecture for both their campus edge and their data center edge. So those products are rolling out in Q3. So we're in very early sampling with customers. And I don't expect material engagement with them in the second half, but I expect a lot of customer interest. And really the material impact of that will be next year. So far, it's a very promising. There is a lot of interest. There is a lot of also commonality in protocols because the work we're doing with VxLAN, EVPN, BGP protocols, plain old fashioned VLAN with MLAGs, looking back and what we did in the early years, are all applicable in the campus. And we're also working closely with HPE and their POE switches and Aruba wireless as well to make sure they work with our Spline. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And on the investment side of that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: What was the question? James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: How far along are we in terms of... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, we're just starting. Manny Rivelo is driving a lot of this investment. It's part of our sales and marketing investment, in general, in expanding both to channels and putting more presence in the enterprise. I would say, every region is making a strong investment there. And we've already started that activity since May. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I will also keep my question to one, mainly because Chuck said please. Jayshree, I'm wondering if you can comment just on the general macro environment. We have a lot of conversations with investors about kind of what the demand picture, particularly from hyperscale, looks like? And what the competitive environment is, if there is changes there from existing competition or from white box? So just like to hear kind of how you're viewing both the demand and competitive side of the market, particularly for hyperscale customers? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, James. Is James the popular name today for questions? So macro environment for cloud titan, so cloud hyperscale in general, is good and healthy. They continue to be our number one vertical both in Q1, Q2, and I anticipate that's going to be the same in second half. With the certifications, the worst of it behind us and much of the cloud spend available, it's always competitive, it's always dynamic. But I think Arista is strongly considered and continues to be considered an important partner and vendor for the cloud titan. So I have not seen any appreciable change in the competitive landscape. I think we have strong spending that we can expect from them throughout this year. And the white box is a white box. Meaning, some of them have captive implementations in their own sites and have had it even before Arista was founded. And we continue to work with them in several tiers, but nothing new there as well. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, James. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the acquisition. Can you share some details on Mojo Networks and the pipeline of customers that they're already working with? And what is kind of your expectation in terms of revenue synergies from this transaction? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'll give it my best shot. It's very early days. What's fascinated us about Mojo is, as you know, we believe the cognitive edge for the campus is changing significantly. And in the past, WiFi was always a second class citizen to wired. You never talked about performance of WiFi in gigabits. It was always megabits or very small speed. And what we're seeing now with 802.1AX and performances in general is WiFi is approaching multi-gigabit speed just like wired is. So the synergy for us is to really focus on making Mojo a software-based acquisition, where we care less about the access point and we care more about the cognitive control, the integration into CloudVision, and Ken's CMP architecture. And the importance of bringing all of this cognitive control is not just to the Spline, but to the WiFi edge. The company has been around a long time. They have a deep expertise in not only WiFi, but also on security with their Wireless Intrusion Protection services. And, Ken, you're with us in the room and you spent a fair amount of time on the due diligence. Maybe you want to add a few words to that? What do you think the promise of Mojo is? Kenneth Duda - Arista Networks, Inc.: We just felt very good alignment with the Mojo team from a technical architecture point of view. That the state management approach that we have pioneered in EOS, they've done something similar on the WiFi management side. And so, we just felt like it's going to be really exciting to make our products work together as a seamless group. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. My question has more to do with operating margins. And I know given the campus switching opportunity, you will be scaling the channel \u2013 or given an opportunity \u2013 should we expect operating margin in the corporate level to converge down to where you guided to it at your Analyst Day, more on the 32% to 34% range? Just want to get some perspective on that and the plan as far as sales and marketing spend, given you just came in above 36%? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think we'd still revert back to \u2013 over the long-term we see the model is being the 32% to 34%. And within that, we've talked about the different level of investment with sales and marketing being in the 10% range. That doesn't happen overnight, right? I mean we have to grow into it. So it is going to take time. And, obviously, it depends on what the top line is doing at the same time. But I think that's still kind of the longer-term model is that it would be 10%, plus or minus sales and marketing investment. And we think, with that, just given the different parts of the business, that can support an adequate investment from a sales and marketing perspective in the enterprise/campus part of the business. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And you may recall, Ita shared this at Analyst day, that in the sales and marketing, we expect the enterprise in international to be higher than the averages. We expect the cloud to be lower than the averages because it's a very technology-driven support and sales model. So, obviously, they'll be moving parts on different verticals there. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then, just one follow-up related to one of your peers noting that cloud deals got pushed out. Is Arista Networks seeing a very similar dynamic with key customers? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. On the last call and at the Analyst Meeting, Andy had made some comments about, I guess, an inflection point in 100-gig. I'm wondering if we could get a little bit more color on your trends in terms of 100-gig ports, whether you're seeing some kind of inflection point? And whether this helps your overall ASPs grow? And whether this is an element helping your overall cloud business? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Simon. Well, I think it's safe to say Arista has really emerged in the last year as a market leader in 100-gig. When you look at all the ports we're driving and the associated ASPs, most market analysts would have us \u2013 Mark Foss was showing me some data \u2013 anywhere from 35% to 45-plus-percent in market share. So we are the number one in 100-gig and have been for the entire 2017. We haven't seen that change in 2018. I think the reasons for that are many, and Andy is absolutely correct. 100-gig ends up being that common denominator of spine aggregation of (26:31) aggregation that's just perfect for many use cases. It can be a value server aggregation, it can be storage, it can be campus, it can be security. So I guess when you say inflection point, we see a continued inflection point for the next several years, is probably the way I would see it, that is just infecting for quite a while here. And that as 400-gig comes in, in 2019 and 2020, 100-gig continues to be vibrant. So we see the two working in tandem in the later years, but currently 100-gig is very, very strong. And... Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Are there metrics you can share in terms of percent of sales or percent of ports, something to help us understand that? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So depends on the vertical. But to give you a general sense, in the cloud vertical, 100-gig is extremely important. I can't think of a single cloud use case where we don't discuss, implement or deploy 100-gig in the leaf or spine. In the enterprise, it can vary. 10-gig can be very important then and they may sometimes look at 40-gig. But we're quickly starting to see the early adopters of enterprise also embrace 100-gig. But that's where it can vary a little bit. The other big thing we're seeing is, you can see quite an excitement in the cloud environment on modular 100-gig which is stronger, with particularly the large scale cloud operators base lining on a large amount of ports. So the scale of 100-gig is far greater. But at the same time, when you go into some of the Tier 1, Tier 2 service providers, we're seeing a lot of 100-gig in the data center or in the residential homes as well. So I guess the net of this is, we see that high-performance 10-gig, 25-gig, 40-gig, 100-gig is very much Arista's strong suite with a much stronger position in 100-gig itself. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. I'm hoping you will give us a little bit more granularity on the acquisition's contribution, given the fact that it's going to close, according to the press release, in the third quarter. What is included or not included in the guidance for it? And the other data point I was looking for was the aggregate enterprise business. If you aggregate all of the various enterprise verticals, what was the growth rate in enterprise year-over-year in the quarter just reported? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I don't know that we're going to give the exact growth rate quarter-over-quarter, but it was healthy, right? I mean enterprise was \u2013 are in the \u2013 kind of tied for the number two slot in our verticals and it continued to grow healthily, right? When you think about the acquisition and incorporating it into the numbers, this is a software model; it's a ratable model. So particularly as you work through some of the purchase accounting, et cetera, it's going to have not a very significant impact in the numbers in Q3. So I think, for now, you can take the guidance as is and expect it not to change just because of the acquisition. I mean, going forward, obviously, it will be a contributor to our software ratable revenue stream in the future. But I think for Q3 and the guidance, you should just take the guidance as is. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: What about on the cost side of the equation for that? I assume that costs are already there? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'd be inclined to say it's something similar, right? We will have the cost there for \u2013 it's effectively less in the quarter, right, because we \u2013 it won't be there for the whole quarter. So it will be easily absorbed into the guidance that we gave you already. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. For your campus strategy, how should we think about the wiring closet? The Mojo acquisition obviously shows that you felt that you needed wireless to bolster your campus offering. Should we expect to see wiring closets switches from Arista, ultimately? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we're approaching the campus, Jason, in a very steady, systematic manner similar to the way we did the data center. So we're not married to the entire campus portfolio coming from Arista. HPE is a good partner for us. So our first approach will be the Cognitive Management Plane and Spline. Our Phase 2 approach will be in wireless end points or edges that require that. And depending on how we do, we don't rule out the possibility of entering deeper in the market. But we're not making any road map suggestions or announcements here. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Sorry, just quick one. How did Aruba respond to this? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We've had a three, four-year partnership. This is a very professional partnership, and there is also a deep friendship. This partnership is well beyond the Mojo acquisition. We're working very closely in the data center and we will continue to work together in the campus as well. So they understand our strategy and we understand theirs, and we work together. And 90% of it is complementary. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. One of the things I didn't hear a lot of on this call at this point has been your router business. I'm just curious if you have any update as it relates to the traction in the router market? And then, in particular, how should we think about the next phase, if you will, of expansion of opportunities in that router market? Is that tied to things like Jericho 2 silicon or is there other things that we could look at over the next 12 months or so to say that, hey, Arista is expanding further? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: No. Thanks, Aaron. I should have said a little bit more. We are very proud of our focus on routing. As you know, we don't need to wait for Jericho 2. Arista is already making great inroads with the FlexRoute licenses we have, and it has grown steadily quarter-over-quarter. You might know that we ended the last year reporting that we were over 200 FlexRoute licenses. And rather than reporting it quarter-over-quarter, since it's no more new, I told you guys I'll come back to you at end of the year. I fully expect we will double that. And I fully expect we will continue to see new customers like we do every quarter. The customers come in a variety of categories. They come in terms of new use cases in the cloud, to new enterprises, to, of course, Tier 1 and Tier 2 service provider. If there is an area I would challenge myself and the team to do better, it's probably service providers. They take a little longer and it certainly tested Arista's patience. I think technologically we're doing very, very well with them, but operationally it takes longer to test and deploy. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much for the details thus far. Just one question from me. And if I heard the prepared comments correctly, it was kind of no change to 2018 outlook. But I'm just trying to bridge the different pieces here, you just beat (34:20) in a very impressive way. Organically, you added on an acquisition that's going to close in Q3, but you mentioned no change really to Q3 or 2018. So are you seeing some softness in your order book going forward? I mean your deferred revenues came down some and you are saying no change, yet you have an acquisition (34:42), so I am just trying to put those all pieces together. Thank you so much. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. If you look at what we did, we grew 28% in Q2. We guided 26% of the upper end of the range. And then, we'll see what we do from there. The acquisition, like I said, it is a software model. So it will be a ratable rev rec model. So we need to work through some of that. But it's not likely to be a big driver of top line just because we'll have to do some of the purchase accounting on their deferred and then it will be ratable model from there on, right? But I think we're looking at \u2013 we think we're still consistent to our mid-20% for the back half of the year. The upper end of the guidance \u2013 the upper end of the range is a 26% growth rate, and then we'll see what we do from there. But I don't think we've seen any particular softness in the business. You would have heard my comments on deferred revenue. I think the deferred revenue is stabilized now. So the Q3 guide should not benefit from deferred \u2013 or from a decline in product deferred. It should stand on its own. So I think we're pretty happy with that as a guidance case, and then we'll go up from there. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much for your details. Much appreciated. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, James. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Steven Enders - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is Steve Enders on for Alex. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could categorize the transitioning in cloud titan spend at this point? Is it more coming from new data center build-outs? Or is it more about expansion of existing footprint? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Steve, it's always a combination of both. As you know, majority of our cloud titan customers are not incrementally growing. They're always constructing new data centers, but they also have to go back in their existing data centers and incrementally add. So we're seeing a nice combination of both. So I wouldn't put weightage on one versus the other. Both sides are doing well. Steven Enders - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Has there been any change in the mix there over the past year or? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Well, I think because of the 100-gig onset, the biggest change to the mix is more 100-gig in both examples. Beyond that, no big change. Steven Enders - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I'm sure you're going to love me after these questions. First off... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Just one question, Paul, right? Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Well, I'm a little slow in the uptake. So I'm hoping you'll just clarify some things for me. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: On Simon's question about merger revenue in the third quarter guidance, you're saying that guidance does include or does not include any revenue from Mojo? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's going to get incorporated sometime mid-Q3 and it's a ratable software model. So it's not going to move the needle is what we're really saying. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right, all right. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We're saying it's a small net acquisition and the revenue is small, so whether it does or doesn't is well within the area of our guidance. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, it's not going to move. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it, got it. All right. On the calendar 2018 revenue guidance, you're saying you're expecting mid-20s for the back half of the year as opposed to mid-20s for the whole year? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Correct. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. And now, for the real questions. Pricing, any change one way or the other? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Paul, I've said this before. No dramatic change, same aggressive competitive situation we've always seen. So no different than last quarter. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Now, that I've got these clarifications out of the way, appreciate that... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: All right. Next question? Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...to my final question. With respect to... Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: Paul, let's hold it for the callback please. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: No worries. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one actually. So (38:55) to Google the CEO's name. So it says that Mojo Network is supposed to get to about $100 million of run rate in about two years and this article is dated like January of 2018. So my question is, is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to exceed that expectation due to being integrated with Arista? I.e., is there any sales synergies with Mojo Networks and Arista working together? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Oh boy, that sounds like an ambitious goal from their current revenue. So I'll have to speak to Rick about my forecasting talents versus his. But how about we come back to you on that one after we know better on integration? That sounds like a very high number. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mitch. I owe you an answer. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to come back to -we've had a lot of incoming questions from investors about inventories at your large cloud titan customers. And maybe there is a theory I guess floating around that maybe they have some inventories as a result of the patent cases that they are unwinding and that's having an effect on sales maybe in the short-term. So I wonder if you could comment on that and also the fact that even at the 25% growth rate in the second half, your seasonality has shifted pretty significantly toward the first half of the year more so than normal. Normally, we see bit more revenue in the back end of the year. So I'm just curious if you could maybe weave those two things together for me? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I think just the revenue trends, let's just take that first. I mean obviously Q1 we grew 40-plus-percent year-over-year because that was a much easier comp off of the first quarter last year, right? So I don't think anything necessarily different in seasonality that we're calling out at least at this point. So again, we're saying mid-20s for the back half of the year. Like I said, it's 26% at the upper end of the range for Q3 and we'll see where we go from there. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So just to reiterate what Ita said, Rod, we're feeling very good about cloud spending. We have in Q1. We definitely do in the Q2 results and the second half is looking strong. And so when you say they have some inventory I mean there is always this issue of did they order the right mix? But we don't see that as a category..... Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm not saying they have inventory. I'm just really asking you if you think they have inventory. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, okay. All right. So I would say, Rod, that speculation is probably not what we're seeing. We're seeing healthy demand. And if they had inventory, they probably wouldn't be buying more. And so, from our perspective the cloud which was kind of in a hiccup for us when you are going through certifications last Q3, Q4 is back and it's that strongly. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you all very much. Last year, the 100-gig transition obviously was very, very favorable for you all. We've got another one, another tech transition happening in about a year with 400-gig certainly in 2019. Can you talk about your positioning for 400-gig? And maybe perhaps your relative positioning versus the competition? With the 100-gig you were so far out in the front that you gained a lot of share. Should we think that your competitive lead there has stayed the same and so there is more share to take? Or is this more of a sedate share gain situation? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. If you would ask me to predict whether we have a sedate share again in 100-gig, I would have thought perhaps that would be the case. So we were pleasantly surprised to see the dramatic market share gains in 100-gig. And I would attribute that to two reasons : one, Ken and the team building excellent products; and the other our competition did not respond to 100-gig as well as we did. So now let's switch gears to your 400-gig question. My view as I said quite often is the 100-gig inflection is a multiyear infection. We're going to continue to see strength, and this is going to be in the form of higher density, in the form of additional options and form factors in the form of 200-gig option. So I don't think the onset of 400-gig in anyway changes the momentum on 100-gig. This is really important to remember and know, because this is going to be the largest market. Now, as the market leader in 100-gig, naturally Arista works with its customers. And instead of hyping and making any pre-announcements, we are making sure architecture is 400-gig capable. And we absolutely will support that and you will expect to see trials and product capabilities from us. We're usually first to market. I don't see why wouldn't be this time. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Okay. And when might first to market be, is that a first half 2019 or a little earlier perhaps? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: When I introduce it, you'll hear about it. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : All right, all right, Jayshree. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And you know why I say that. A lot of this is dependent on the chip vendors and making sure we get a real production-worthy product, and we're not just putting out samples that we can ramp nicely because it's not how we put unit one that matters. It's how we put unit 1,000 that also matters with the right quality, as Ken will (44:36). Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I have a question on margins, Ita. So I thought the cloud titan strength is somewhat negative to gross margin. So I was somewhat surprised by the gross margin strength. And along the same lines, I'm trying to understand what's driving the operating margin guidance almost a 400 basis points of decline? Is it simply higher spending or anything else going on there? Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So you're correct that in a quarter where we have a heavier cloud mix, you should expect that to pressure gross margin, right? Still within our 63% to 65% range, and we had guided for that, right? We did task the team to focus on gross margin and focus on cost control, et cetera, this quarter to help offset that and they did a pretty nice job of that. And, obviously, the higher service content contributed a little bit to that too, right? But as a general statement, I would stand by the 63% to 65% with cloud pressuring to lower end depending on where we're in the quarter. I think that's the way to think about it. The operating margin guide for the quarter is really the long-term model, right, which is the 32% to 34%. And we'll grow into that over time, right? It's not going to happen straightaway. But when you look at the investment thesis we laid out, that's where we think we will be in the longer-term. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And we're going to absorb a fair amount of employees with the acquisition, right? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Right. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: So we will have more expense. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. So you're including the OpEx from the acquisition in the outlook, but not the revenue? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. We're definitely including some expense there. But again, I would think about the 32% to 34% as a longer-term model that we're growing into. So it won't happen overnight. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: The expense is guaranteed, the revenue is not. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: All right, Srini. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Hi, Jayshree; hi, Ita. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi. Hi, Vijay. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not James fortunately. So, Jayshree, a bigger picture question. And campus honestly has been a channel sale, so like to get your viewpoint, Jayshree, on how do you plan to kind of build and scale a channel? And also your direct sales footprint, now that you have wireless asset to sell, you have campus core switching? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Vijay. Yeah, that is a good question and one we won't get to overnight. As you were at the Analyst Day, you probably observed, our first natural synergy in the campus will be our own customers who already know us and love us for EOS. Our second will be, as we build out our enterprise sales force, we fully expect that that will be direct customer driven and channel driven. And the third order would probably be especially a focus internationally where we already have channel presence. So this is something Manny Rivelo and Anshul are working very closely on. But it's work in progress and will take time. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Erik, are you there? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think we lost Erik. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sorry, we missed the first part. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Can you hear me all right? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We can now. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : You can hear me okay? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes, we can hear you now, but you need to restart. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : All right, sorry about that. All right. I just wanted to understand you had noted that the long-term guidance is 32% to 34%, but you're guiding for Q3 to be 32% to 34%. Is that to suggest that there is upside to that in the near-term? Is that how we should be thinking about your Q3 guidance? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean, I think that's the guide. And, obviously, we will have to absorb some costs from the acquisition, et cetera, on top of that. So we're reserving the right to spend what we need to spend to do that. So I think that's the guide, but I think we've talked about this in the past, but we will grow into those investments. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Exactly. We're going to continue to aggressively invest in R&D. And as you all keep asking me, we also need to invest in the sales and marketing and enterprise channel. So on one hand, you expect us to do that; on the other hand, you say, gee, why isn't it higher. So if we don't execute, we'd be higher, but we want to execute. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Can you tell us how many people is Mojo Networks? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. It's over 250 employees. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Then real quick, the Mojo solution is software, that's the only product in your portfolio that's just a software-based solution. Might we assume that your campus \u2013 this might lead you to make more campus products that will be white box and your portion will be just the software aspect of it reflective of a longer-term strategy? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We'll take this question off-line, but I'll give you a short answer to it. First of all, the Mojo product is not our first software product. We have four or five already in flight, CloudVision, our macro-segmentation security, our FlexRoute licenses, our TAP aggregation DANZ product. So we have a number of software-only options, and CloudVision is probably the best example of that. And I think the way to look at this is software has to run on something, it does run on hardware. And at any given time you look for disruptive technology, no matter which way it's packaged, software-only, software plus hardware, or in the case of a lot of optics and cables, it's hardware-only. So we haven't really formed a strategy of software-only, but we do the right thing which makes sense. And in this case, it was such a natural synergy with the cognitive campus vision we have and the cloud-managed products we have with CloudVision that this is a very nice software-based acquisition. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. So I'm looking at the Mojo website right now, it says here they make access points and wiring closet switches. And so, I guess I understand or I am trying to understand the Cognitive WiFi pioneer, but are you saying then you're going to discontinue those kinds of hardware-based products? Or I assume more likely you will continue to sell those in the marketplace? And then, more broadly, I guess I'm just trying to understand kind of what the bigger picture is here for Arista. I mean when you guys talked about pushing into campus, you really focused on the notion that you were going to be focused on the core where you had some natural synergies with your data center switch business. And now, it seems like you're going more broadly into the campus. And I guess I just want to understand kind of where you guys see the lines in terms of how you're going to compete in campus longer-term? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, George. That's a loaded long question and I'll try to be concise. So there is no question that our primary strategy, as Ken alluded to, is the combination of our Cognitive Management Plane and our Spline. We're leading with that. That's our strength. It's a natural extension from the data center. That's where we expect to succeed first. And then, there is a diverse suite of edges. Majority of the edges will probably come from third-party, partners or even competitors. So we're not making any declaration or statement on Mojo's PoE switches or on our PoE switches. There is no stated intent at this time here. What we bought Mojo for was their WiFi, their Cognitive WiFi and the software capabilities associated with the access points. So give us a chance to integrate the acquisition and decide what we do and don't do and how we do it. But understand that the epicenter of Mojo is not the switches; it's really the WiFi. Operator : Your last question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Good evening, and thank you for my questions. Jayshree, in the last Q1 call, there is a concern that demand for 100 gigs may normalize in 2018 after strong sales upside in 2017. I believe that was the main rationale of growth expectation in the mid-20%. Today, you sounded very optimistic about 100 gigs and its long-tailed inflection point. My question is should we still be watchful that at some point we may see 100 gigs to normalize? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take this question in two halves, Hendi. Is 100-gig normalizing? No. We're still seeing a lot of demand, and it's continuing to grow. Both from a total available market, I don't see much normalization. It's got multi-year growth and Arista's position, right? Now, obviously, 2017 was a real escalation year because we were literally going from nothing to everything. So the next few years, the rate of growth maybe slower, but the dollars will be very large and very healthy and very rich for Arista. So that's one. Then the second thing is, come back to the rate of growth again. The rate of growth has to do with the fact that we had two extremely exceptional quarters last year. And that is more normalized to the mid-20s, if you look more broadly, off some very large base of numbers. So we're now talking about north of $500 million a quarter. So that shouldn't be confused with the fact that we can do well and we'll continue to do well in 100-gig. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Hendi. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Hendi. Chuck Elliott - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q2 2018 earnings call. Thank you for all the good questions and for the opportunity to highlight our financial results and corporate achievements for you. I also want to mention that we've posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website. We look forward to continuing conversation with you during the quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Bechtolsheim, Arista's Chairman and Chief Development Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, industry innovations, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Charles. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter of 2018 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a record Q3, once again surpassing the consensus estimates. We exceeded our guidance comfortably with a non-GAAP revenue of $563.3 million, as we grew 28.7% year-over-year, despite tough comparisons from Q3 2017. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.11, with services contribution at 13.8% of overall sales. From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 72% of total revenue, while the rest of our international theaters performed quite well. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.6%, exceeding our forecast due to product mix. Our top 10 customers included all five verticals. Cloud Titans contributed extremely well in Q3 and ranked as our number one vertical, followed by cloud specialized providers and enterprises tied at the number two spot; and financials and service providers tied at third place. Our new customer acquisition and million-dollar customers continues to be solid as well. And the adoption of CloudVision and FlexRoute software exceeds our expectations. We closed our first two acquisitions in Q3, both Mojo Networks for Cognitive WiFi and Metamako for low latency based in Sydney, Australia. The acquisition of Metamako plays a defining role in deepening Arista's heritage with next-generation low latency platforms. Metamako's ultra-low latency focus based on unique FPGA designs delivers 5 to 50 nanoseconds with a predictable 70 picosecond timestamping accuracy. Last month, Arista introduced the new 400-gigabit fixed switches the 7060X4 Series. This is based on the new Broadcom merchant silicon Tomahawk 3 with significant routing and buffering improvements. It includes 12.8 terabytes capacity in a single RU form factor with superior price performance, power efficiency, density and buffer memory, all supported with our proven single image EOS. EOS also brings differentiated traffic management, load-balancing and resilience, and it eases the qualification of our customers in cloud scale networks. We expect early customer trials to begin this quarter in Q4 and mainstream production in 2019. I would like to take this opportunity to invite Andy, our Chairman and Chief Development Officer, to elaborate more on the details. Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree. 400-gig Ethernet is the next step in the evolution of Ethernet, delivering four times better scalability and density and up to two times the price performance and power efficiency of our existing 100-gig Ethernet products. One of the great things about 400-gig E is that it really showcases our ability to rapidly bring new switch silicon to market that is fully supported by our market-leading EOS network operating system. This means that customers can deploy the latest Arista 400-gig Ethernet switches in their production networks with confidence. Going forward, we expect rapid evolution of new merchant silicon for 400-gig. Our ability to quickly release new switches based on the latest merchant silicon with fully supported EOS software is a key competitive advantage with short merchant switch silicon lifecycles. While we are very excited about the 400-gig growth opportunity, we do expect to see a lot of 400-gig qualification activity in the first half of 2019, with initial 400-gig production deployments in the second half. The 400-gig ramp in 2019 is also constrained by the volume availability of 400-gig optics, which so far are only available in prototype quantities. Please keep in mind that customers are not waiting for 400-gig to build out their networks. We are still in the midst of a major network upgrade cycle to 100-gigabit Ethernet, which is expected to continue to ramp strongly next year, with industry analysts expecting shipments of more than 16 million 100-gig ports in 2019, compared to less than 1 million 400-gig reports. So, clearly, it will take some time for 400-gig to ramp up. In summary, we at Arista are very excited about the benefits 400-gig offers to our customers and we expect to take a leading role in the rollout of 400-gig Ethernet in 2019 and beyond. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. I really appreciate your tenacity in driving optics and 400-gig. And I think you do that not only for Arista, but the entire industry. What is clear to us is that we are in the midst of a multi-year cycle for high-performance cloud networking for both 100-gig and emerging 400-gigabit Ethernet spines. And so, as I reflect upon our 2018 strategy, we are executing well across many fronts, including innovative platforms, the migration from securities being a silo to a holistic segmentation, our partnerships with VMware in micro-segmentation and a multi-cloud zone segmentation support for Zscaler, Amazon AWS, Google, GCP and Microsoft Azure. We're also coping well with the 10% tariffs effected by USTR on September 24, 2018 now affecting our networking products. With judicious planning by our manufacturing teams, we are reducing our dependency on China-sourced components gradually and increasing our manufacturing capacity outside China next year. Meanwhile, we have implemented a short-term tariff fee of 3.3% as we are absorbing some of the incurred costs with the expectation that we can mitigate them in the future. It has been 10 years since Arista started shipping products. And as I reflect over the past decade, I am very proud of Arista's leadership, our board, our employees, plus our teamwork and execution from startup phase in 2008 to the prestige of becoming an S&P 500 company this year. I don't think any of us could have accurately predicted the pace and magnitude of Arista's results. In Q3 2018, we exceeded a cumulative of 20 million cloud networking ports. To give you a perspective on this exponential traction, it took us five years to obtain our first 1 million ports or 5%, which means we shipped 95% in the next five years between 2013 and 2018, which I think is quite a ramp indeed. In particular, our cloud customers have transformed the face of networking forever by mandating Arista as the gold standard in technology, quality and support. We continue to experience momentum not only in this vital sector, but the propagation of these cloud principles to next-generation data centers, LAN, WAN, campus enterprises and service providers with NFV, peering and routing attributes, turning legacy PINs into places in the cloud, or PICs as we call it. Now, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita, our CFO, for greater details on Q3 2018. Ita? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2018 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, acquisition-related charges and certain lawsuit-related costs. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenue in Q3 was $563.3 million, up 29% year-over-year and above our guidance of $540 million to $552 million. We were pleased with overall demand in the quarter with ongoing strength across the business. Service revenues for the quarter were approximately 13.8% of revenue, down from 14.4% last quarter, which had included an unusually high level of renewal activity. International revenues for the quarter came in at $157 million or 28% of total revenue, up slightly from the prior period, reflecting strength in our in-region international businesses. Our international base is still relatively small and will experience some volatility on a quarterly basis as the business develops. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.6%, up from 64.5% last quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance of 63% to 65%. This outperformance versus guidance primarily reflected a slightly higher revenue mix from our non-cloud customers. Operating expenses for the quarter were $155.1 million, up from $143.9 million last quarter. R&D spending came in at $105.6 million or 18.7% of revenue, up from $92.3 million in the prior period, reflecting incremental head count and higher prototype and NRE spending in support of new products. Sales and marketing expense was $41 million or 7.3% of revenue, up from $39.9 million last quarter due to increased head count. Our G&A costs were 1.7% of revenue and excluded some acquisition-related legal and accounting fees, as described below. Our operating income for the quarter was $209 million or 37.1% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $8.6 million and our effective tax rate, 21.3%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $171.3 million or 30.4% of revenue. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 81 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of $2.11, up 30% from the prior year. We completed purchase accounting for the Mojo and Metamako acquisitions in the period with immaterial amounts of revenue and expense included in our non-GAAP results for the third quarter. For those of you who focus on our GAAP results, we recorded $3.4 million of acquisition-related expenses and $5.9 million of acquisition-related tax charge in the period, which we consider to be one-time in nature and which together with $1.6 million of amortization of acquired intangibles have been excluded from our non-GAAP results. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $1.7 billion, down from $1.9 billion last quarter. As a reminder, although the $405 million charge related to the settlement of our lawsuit with Cisco was reported as a non-GAAP expense in Q2 2018, the cash payment for this amount did not occur until the third quarter. Excluding the Cisco payment, we generated $286 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong net income performance and improved working capital metrics. DSOs came in at 53 days, up from 46 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of billings and collections in the quarter. Inventory turns were 3.2 times, up from 2.7 times in Q2. Inventory decreased to $216.3 million in the quarter, down from $245.4 million in the prior period. This reflects reductions primarily in raw materials buffers as we continue to optimize our supply chain. In addition, we maintained a further $19.3 million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets, compared to $25.3 million last quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $529.9 million, up from $448.6 million in Q2. Product deferred revenue increased by approximately $38 million in the quarter, largely related to customer certification of features reintroduced into the product following the expiration and invalidation of certain lawsuit-related patents. Accounts payable days were 39 days, up from 26 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.5 million. And now turning to guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter and beyond, we believe that we remain well positioned with our key cloud customers and continue to grow our presence across our other verticals. The midpoint of our revenue guidance in the fourth quarter of $582 million to $594 million results in revenue growth for the full-year 2018 of approximately 30%. Turning to gross margin and the impact of the recent tariff announcements. The operations team is working diligently to optimize our supply chain and mitigate the incremental costs for both Arista and our customers. We expect these supply chain modifications to take effect throughout 2019 as we ramp new sources of supply. In the interim, we've introduced a tariff adder, whereby we will pass a portion of these costs to our customers pending completion of the (15:12). We expect the impact on gross margins in the fourth quarter 2018 to be somewhat muted as we ship backlog and assume pre-tariff finished goods and component inventories. Based on everything that we know now, we would reiterate our typical gross margin range of 63% to 65%, knowing that tariff impacts, et cetera, will limit our ability to outperform the 64% midpoint of this range. With this in the backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain lawsuit-related costs, is as follows : revenues of approximately $582 million to $594 million; gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 35%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 81.3 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : Your first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Balaji on for Rod Hall. I had a question on the competitive landscape as we move into the 400G deployments. And maybe if you could describe how you would characterize the changes? Clearly, Cisco's keeping up with you guys at this point or at least it looks like they are keeping up. And they've also had a lot of engineering engagement. So is there any difference there? And maybe also just commentary on the optics supply shortages that you said, is there any difference between OSFP and QSFP-DD? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'll kick it off, Balaji, and then I'll hand it to, of course, Andy, who is much more deeply entrenched in this. We haven't seen any significant change in competitive landscape. As the market leader in 100-gig Ethernet, I think everybody's declared their products and introductions just as they did in 100-gig. Time will tell what the real capabilities of these products are and how we match. But we're very confident of our outstanding capabilities and differentiators. Particularly, and don't underestimate the importance of combining the right silicon with the right operating system and differentiated features. Inconsistent drivers and discontinuity of OS can be extremely cumbersome for customers. So, ease of qual (18:05) is very important as well. We also firmly believe that internally-developed ASICs are not keeping up with merchant silicon and are often not competitive in the 400-gig market. Andy, you want to add to that? Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The other thing is the demand for 400-gig clearly comes primarily from the cloud where we have a strong footprint and there's virtually no demand from legacy enterprise for 400-gig. Cloud customers in particular have little time for experimenting with new software platforms and greatly prefer to go with trusted solutions. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And what about the optics, Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Oh. The optics are not yet in volume production and it remains to be seen how quickly they ramp up here. You realize there's a ramp-up cycle for the whole supply chain, the optics vendors have to order the parts, they have to make the models and so on, they are waiting for purchase orders. So our current belief is that the supply will only reach what you would consider volume in the second half of next year. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And we are very Switzerland and neutral. Andy and the team are supporting both OSFP and DD-QSFP. So, both have advantages depending on where you're starting from. So, Arista will support both. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Two points. One, just on the last one, is your impression that your competitor for the 400-gig is using internally-developed silicon or is it based on Broadcom as well? And then, secondly, on the tariff front, I just want to be clear, you're adding on a 3% charge for your U.S. customers, is that how you're approaching the tariff impact? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. So, let me try and take on both questions and I'll hand it to Ita for further clarification if needed. On the competitive front, obviously, we're not the experts on implementation. But to the best of our understanding, the announcement was only made yesterday. Some of the models use internal silicon and some of them use non-Broadcom merchant silicon. So they are not really a direct comparison to Arista's introductions. And on the tariff side, yes, we're applying a universal 3.3% adder worldwide because a lot of our components are affected worldwide as well as our PCBs. So it's not just U.S. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree, obviously, you said before many times that the cloud CapEx, the correlation between your business and the overall CapEx is not very high. But there are definitely a lot of concerns in the investor community about CapEx slowing down over the next few quarters. I just want to hear your thoughts about what you're seeing out there in the market. What are your customers telling you about next year, if anything? And given where we are in terms of how high the CapEx is, if it were to slowdown, what kind of impact do you think you'll see in your business? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. It's a good question, Srini, even though it gets asked many times. It still remains one of the most popularly asked questions. As you know, our cloud customers have been adopting Arista unabated for over five years. It's not a one-quarter phenomena. It's a 25-quarter phenomena. We don't see any near-term signs of that changing nor the predicted concerns. It is true that we don't track one-to-one with their cloud CapEx. And remember now that despite the lumpiness of the Cloud Titans, and we have many of them, we are comfortable with the continued spend because there are multiple use cases. And we expect this to continue this quarter and early 2019, given our typical two-quarter visibility. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Srini. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And congrats, ladies and Andy, on a good quarter. I had two small ones. First of all, you haven't talked about campus, that little product thing that (22:29) in the quarter. So, maybe you can help us talk about business activity there, volume, trial activity, pipeline, how does that look? And then just clarification, Ita, on the tariff again. I just want to make sure, if you didn't put on the adder, would your revenue guidance be 3% lower than what it is? I mean, I'm just trying to understand whether the guidance really captures an extra 3% just from a tariff perspective? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think in Q4 in particular, we have got backlog that was booked prior to the tariff, but I don't really think we can just aggregate and start trying to carve out that 3%. And as we go forward, obviously the goal is to remediate the cost as much as possible and start to kind of normalize that for us and for customers over time. So I wouldn't try to say it's somehow an adder to the top line. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: It's more an offset to \u2013 otherwise we take a bigger hit in margin. So we're absorbing some of the costs and passing on some is the way to look at it, Ittai. So, Ittai, to address your campus question, as we've often said, lot of excitement on the architecture, a lot of excitement on the acquisition of Mojo, not material in revenue this year or the first half of 2019 has been our consistent statement, and that is true. Having said that, since our last update, we have introduced the X3 Spline as we call it. This is used both in campus use cases and in data center cases, comes in a modular and fixed form factor, and that has been very well received and is in early trials in the campus. Customers are excited about that. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Very good. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. Could you tell us what drove the strength in deferred revenue, just any color on the material step-up? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest driver relates to \u2013 as we came out of the lawsuit, we had actually invalidated some patents and we'd had some patents expire. And that gave us access to some technology that we had redesigned out of the product previously. And now we've obviously put that back into the product because we have access to that technology. And for some customers, there's a need to re-qualify that new design, that new product, and we're engaged in doing that currently. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up is regarding tariffs and your campus switching rollout. Have you heard from customers opting into the Arista Networks switches on mainly the campus switching side, simply because pricing is more favorable to adopt it rather than some of the competing products that might be seeing a higher tariff rate? Could we get any kind of color around that and customer behavior? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I mean, I think the general answer is no, that the tariff is not a reason to choose or not choose Arista products. And in particular on the campus, majority of our business, almost all, is data center. So there's no correlation to be made on data center products or campus products to the tariffs, Sam. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Yeah. So, a question and a clarification for me, please. Andy, I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind comparing and contrasting what we ought to expect out of this 400-gig upgrade cycle versus 2017's 100-gig? Is it as powerful? Do you expect to gain as much share? Any thoughts along those lines would be helpful. And then, Ita, I guess I wasn't quite clear as it sounded as though the Cloud Titan mix was better in Jayshree's initial remarks, but then it sounded like the mix was away from Cloud Titan in your gross margin explanation. So, if you could clarify that for me, I'd be grateful. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Let me just pick that one up first. I mean, it was very slightly mixed towards the non-cloud. And if you saw the gross margin, it was like 10 basis points. So it wasn't a big shift one way or the other. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Okay. And then on your question on the 400-gig expectations, I would like to refer you to the market analysts like Dell'Oro and others that have modeled and predicted this in fair detail. One thing I can mention here is that the crossover in bandwidth shift between 400-gig and the 100-gig is currently projected to be in 2021. So it will take some time for 400-gig to come up to the same level of bandwidth as the 100-gig. 100-gig, if you look at these reports, is ramping extremely strongly based on the fact that it's fully available, fully qualified for optics (27:24) volumes, et cetera. So, a large cloud company or a customer that wants to deploy a new data center really has no choice. They will deploy this as 100-gig today because that's the only way they can buy hundred thousands of optics and so on each quarter. Whereas on the 400-gig side, it will take some time to get to those kind of volumes. In addition, I would like to observe that for brownfield data centers, meaning if you upgrade an existing data centers, it's easy to stay with the same speed throughout the data center. So, most likely those data centers will stay with 100-gig for some time. For a greenfield data center, you have a choice. You can start with 400-gig but, again, only when those components are available in sufficient volume. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Thank you, all. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask one clarifying question to build on Ittai's question for Ita, is that in the formulation of guidance for the December quarter, how much is contemplated to contribute from the acquisitions that closed in the third quarter? And then, taking advantage of Andy being here on the call today, Andy, can you talk a little bit about the number of hyperscale customers or what you consider to be hyperscale customers that Arista has and how that's changing? And I guess, more importantly, how are the requirements changing for the newer customers in terms of what they're looking for from Arista? And how is that the same or different from your traditional customers? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So, James, I think on the acquisitions, again I'd remind you that Mojo is a SaaS model. So, that's going to be a ratable rev rec model for us. So, that's a relatively small contribution. On the Metamako side, that's already being rolled into our kind of financials vertical. It's now becoming part of the offering there and it's definitely been impactful with customers and opportunities with customers. But we're not planning to really track that separately. And then I'll tell you that the combined impact on the quarter is small, right? You've got the Mojo stuff is a SaaS ratable revenue amount and then we have kind of single-digit coming out of the Metamako side of the house. So it's a small contribution at this point. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On the cloud customer question, we cannot disclose the name of our cloud customers. But I think we have said repeatedly that the competitive environment in this market hasn't really changed. Obviously, every cloud customer is extremely concerned about network reliability, resilience, up-time, et cetera. And my belief is that our fundamental competitive advantage is our EOS operating system which delivers those qualities. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Great quarter. I just had two actually small ones. So, first, just on the cloud enterprise financials. So, of those three, is it still the case that cloud is kind of the fastest-growing segment? And then enterprise, I'm not looking for exact growth rates, just kind of a trajectory. And then, secondly, how much was the acquisition actually benefiting you guys, is just a few million, just looking for a way to get a number around that. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Let me take the vertical question. There's no doubt that the cloud segment, both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cloud, has been growing faster than any others, if you put those two together. However, the enterprise is the fastest because it's starting off a much smaller base and we're accumulating customers and million-dollar accounts very rapidly there and there's a lot of interest on both the data center side, where we're succeeding and installing, and the campus side, which we hope to convert into success next year. And your second question was? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think it was just \u2013 in Q3, the acquisitions contributed very little, right? The Metamako only came in kind of half... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Two weeks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: September. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: And again, the Mojo acquisition was probably \u2013 we probably got a whole month or a little bit more than that, but again it was a SaaS ratable model, right? So they contributed very little to Q3. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. So I guess, just to clarify real quick, getting less than 1 point for next quarter, is that roughly correct? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Again, like I said, we're not really going to start tracking this individually, particularly as we roll the products in to the portfolio. I think for Q4 what I said was low-single-digit contribution. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And perhaps it will help to Mitch, if you look at both of these as tuck-in acquisitions, one's going to help our campus overall and one is already helping our financials since we're in high-frequency trading and low-latency applications already. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mitch. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Mitch. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the federal vertical. We had picked up that you guys are starting to gain some traction there. So can you talk about where you are with federal? What type of momentum that you're seeing? And where could this business be in a couple of years? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think Arista is becoming more and more committed to the federal market, not only in the U.S. but worldwide. We have completed a lot of important certifications. So we see this as a big opportunity and one we fully intend to invest in. Obviously, we'll be responsible about reporting wins and losses. Until something's public, we won't really comment on rumors or protests. So, can't say anything about specific wins and losses, but definitely an important segment for us worldwide. We're doing well in many parts and many international theaters as well. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and congrats on a solid quarter here, Jayshree and team. Just a clarification about the cloud business. I think historically you've talked about Microsoft kind of this 10% to 15% range. I think your expectation is that it's above 10% this year. Is that still how things are shaping up? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Although the Cloud Titans is a composition of many customers, Microsoft has always been our number one customer and I believe it'll continue to be our number one in a very solid fashion in 2018 and will be well over 10%. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Jayshree, could you take us through some of the early deals with the campus products? I know it's early days but just how are enterprise customers reaching you on these products and sort of deal size, scope of projects, compared to what you've done in enterprise before? Just kind of compare and contrast what you've seen so far. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Alex, it's probably a little early for the level of detail you are looking at. And I promise I'll answer that question next year better. And I've been personally involved in this. The pattern match I see is many of them have, like the data center, an architectural need to shift and change, where they've got the classic three-tiered model and they want to move to the leaf spine or often a single-tier Spline model and then have different device edge connectivity. So they're looking to make that change. And sometimes it's a brand new building they're going to construct next year or a year after or it's a brownfield. The second pattern I'm seeing is that they are already very comfortable with Arista's spines as Splines, and they're using our EOS. And they're going, oh, geez, I don't need to build a separate campus box. I can use the same spine or Spline and enable campus features on that box, whether it's BGP routing or VXLAN or tunneling or security features, so architecturally. And the third thing we're seeing is CloudVision for the campus is something they're very excited about. We demonstrated some of that capability at the Gartner Conference. John McCool and Jeff Raymond and the team have done a fantastic job there. And I think you will see these three being the anchors, the design is changing, the cognitive management plane architecture, and our data center customers really want to expand their footprint with us into the campus. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter as well. I wanted to ask maybe a longer-term strategic question around the Metamako acquisition. I'm just curious, as you kind of fold that into the product portfolio, and clearly a little bit differentiated in its usage of FPGAs, how do you see FPGAs fitting relative to merchant silicon? And with that acquisition, is there a certain subset or addressable market that you can now address that previously you couldn't and what size would that be? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think, Aaron, your question is very thought-provoking. As you know, Arista's core being is to adopt and massively deploy merchant silicon in our extensible software. But there are use cases that require deeper programmability. One example even before Metamako would be the P4 programmability we do on the Barefoot silicon. And the FPGA definitely allows us to go capture more state and improve our latency, and really get to the heart of the application in many of these customers and certain verticals for electronic trading. Andy, you may want to comment on this. I know you've been deeply involved. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah, meaning, you can't beat the latency of an FPGA for those types of applications which include both Wall Street type applications and also very precise traffic monitoring and network visibility kind of applications. So it may not be the biggest market, but it's a very important one, it's a key market for many of our customers. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And do you see this broadening across the product portfolio over time? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think it would depend on how big the market gets. But I think at this point we'll keep it focused on the specific application-driven use cases. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to understand related to 400-gig, you mentioned kind of the differentiation that you have related to some of your competitors like Cisco, et cetera. How should I think about how this plays into the competitive dynamics with white-box? Particularly, is the technology from those manufacturers keeping up or should I think of 400-gig being an opportunity for you to gain share? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Samik, I think the white-box is a bit of a tangential discussion on any speed. There's really two types of players who deploy white-box. One is a captive deployment in cloud customers that are looking to build their own and they're going to do the same thing, whether it's 10-gig, 40-gig, 100-gig or 400-gig. And the second is maybe experimental HPC clusters, et cetera, where people may try this. We don't see 400-gig and white-box really that connected. In fact, that is one place I would tell you that the requirement for predictable performance and not compromising speeds will require the best hardware and best software combination. So, that's not a combination that comes to mind as the first use case for 400-gig. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. And then just if I can follow-up on the... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Samik. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: I'm sorry, Samik. We're just restricted to one question. Can we take the next one? Operator : Your next question comes from Fahad Najam with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. Can you remind us how your traction in the routing market is going and if you're hitting your target? I think, if I recall, you indicated that you expect at least to hit $50 million in annual revenue from routing. Are you still tracking to that target or are you exceeding that, any commentary on the routing adoption? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Sure. I will give you some year-end numbers. The way we track it, don't really do it by revenue, we do it by customers and FlexRoute licenses. We've got three routing licenses that we track on and we are doing well in the acceptance of that license, particularly in the cloud, service provider and enterprise markets. It's going well. But I would like it to go even better. Especially in the service provider market I think we can have more improved results. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, any update in terms of do you think you're taking share in the routing market right now as is or is this still in cloud... Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: We do believe we are displacing designs. Taking share would mean we track that market. We don't participate in the classic traditional router market. But we're absolutely taking share and applying routing onto our switching platforms and increasing our switch market share in routing use cases. Fahad Najam - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Fahad. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the commentary, Andy, offered on the 400-gig market and the timing being biased towards the second half of the year. I'm wondering if you have your own perspective on how to size this particular market, partly because I'm confused. When I look at the quoted data from Dell'Oro versus the IHS, they seem to be a very broad range, as high as $1.5 billion (41:17) for 400-gig in 2019 seems hard to believe. So I was hoping to get your perspective on that and also some clarification on \u2013 you talked about the starting price at $1,800, that's a low price. Just want to understand what's the customer getting for that? Thank you. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I believe that the lower numbers include optics connected to the port. So, when we talk about $1,800, that's purely the switch port excluding the optics. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Exactly. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: That's a very important difference. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.: The optics cost more than the switch port typically, in some cases significantly more. So there's a gap there, right? But going back to your question, I think the best thing you can do is read multiple market research reports. Some of them talk more to the cloud people in particular or more on top of the cloud developments than perhaps others. There's just a lot of momentum right now on 100-gigabit, which is also reflected in these reports. And the reality is the 400-gig can only be deployed once the optics and all the systems are available in high volume, because a volume deployment for a large cloud customer is like 100,000 ports a quarter, right? And you can't buy 100,000 optics right now a quarter. So it takes a while for the supply chain to simply catch up with those kind of numbers. And with 100-gig, all the optics and all the systems are available in high volume today and ramping. So it takes time. But both are growing and they are incremental to each other. I wouldn't say one is displacing the other one already. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: I think it's a really important point that Andy made. If you go pattern-match with how we did on 100-gig, there's some striking parallels. We had some early trials in 2015, 2016. But it took 12 to 18 months for the market share lead we took and got, because the whole ecosystem had to come into play. Something similar happened with 25-gig as well. Until the entire ecosystem comes to place, which takes 6 to 12 months, you don't see that ramp. So I think all the market studies are pointing to that ramp in 2020 or 2021. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. That makes a ton of sense. Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Congrats on the quarter, ladies and Andy. Ita, this one is more for you. It kind of looks like Q4 guide implies a low- to mid-single digit sequential increase for product revenue compared to typically a low-double-digit increase. Is there a reason for the caution or conservatism? Or is it more related to the tax impact there? And specifically as well, is there any concern around hyperscaler spending as you look into Q4 and 2019? Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: No, I mean, I think if you look at the guidance, we are largely at the upper end of the guidance of the 27% year-over-year growth rate. I think that's in line with kind of what we had said is the expectations. And I don't think there's anything unusual about the guidance in that sense. I think we're comfortable where we are from a business perspective and that's pretty much in line actually with what we've laid out kind of right from the beginning, certainly from the middle of the year. So I don't think there's anything unusual about the guidance. It's not really trying to reflect any particular key driver. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And any of the clarity on the hyperscaler spending for Q4 and 2019? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I'd go back to what Jayshree said, I think for what we have visibility to, I think we're comfortable with where we are. We think we're well positioned and we'll see where we go from there. But we haven't seen anything different in the business in kind of that timeframe that we have visibility. It's kind of been business as usual. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thanks. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from James Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. When we think about your campus deployment, I know it will take a little bit of time to see how successful it is or not. Can you at least update us about are you first targeting like your top 20 accounts or your certain regions or are you going to all your sales force at once? And then maybe for Ita, a question about the tariffs is, I would have thought that the ITC ban would have positioned Arista quite favorably for the sourcing and supply chain of how you do things, is that correct? But still you just need the 3.3% tariff increase? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So, just, James, to address your campus question, the most natural conversation is with our customer base across all five verticals because they already know us and love us and are familiar with us and can see use cases. The next natural conversation is with the acquisition of Mojo, we're actually getting exposure to new customers. And some of the interest in WiFi is separate from our customer base. So, that's also a second motion. And from a sales and go-to-market, both Anshul and Manny are really focusing on campus as a mainstream effort. There's no sideshow going on here. And so we're building an entire sales expertise and especially SE expertise. So, where we are putting special emphasis is not all of our sales team understands WiFi and radio management. So we do have specialized SE expertise there. But the rest of the sales is across the entire sales and marketing focus, there's nothing unique to campus. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And to your other question, Jim, I think we've certainly diversified our supply base and our outsourcing probably more than maybe we would have if we hadn't come through some of the ITC stuff. But there's still work to do. I mean, we were still sourcing in China. There are certain components that are still being sourced in China, et cetera. So we do have work to do to mitigate some of those costs. And that's obviously top of mind for John McCool and his team to get that done as quickly as possible. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much for the details and clarification. It's greatly appreciated. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the international portion of your business. Obviously, you have very tough comps here and tough comps for the next couple of quarters. But could you parse a little bit between the slowdown in that business, between economic conditions versus the comps, and just give us a little bit of color between Europe and APAC? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, you're absolutely right, Alex. I think tough comps is the issue. We did very well organically in our overall geography. However, some of the volatility was defined by where the global customers and their spend resided. So, Asia-Pac was strong, EMEA was a little weak, but U.S. was strong across the board. So, it just turned out that way depending on where the Cloud Titans and the top 10 providers spend. But the organic business is still intact and doing well. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And I think you've seen when we filed the Q, but we do have some volatility back and forth between EMEA and APAC over the last couple of quarters, right, because again the base is still relatively small. So, when you win a sizable deal or a couple of sizable deals, then one or the other is going to (48:50). Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: If I could just add ask one clarification. Jayshree, did you guys say low-single-digit millions or low-single-digit percentage in terms of the contribution from acquisitions? It wasn't clear which one you were referring to? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Million. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Millions, Alex. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: It's still relatively small. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Single-digit million. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yes. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Thank you and great Q3 performance. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Hendi. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: So, Jayshree, Arista defined cognitive campus as the next frontier. I would like to understand more about your go-to-market strategy, how similar, how different it is with your core go-to-market and whether you will have some closest partners? Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, that's a very good question, Hendi. Obviously, the low-hanging easiest go-to-market is the one we already have. And we've now got a nice healthy base of over 5,000 customers. We're going to leverage that. However, that will be a necessary but not sufficient condition to participate in the campus. We are expanding. And one of Manny's initiatives is, in fact, to complement our direct customer focus with an elite channel strategy focus. We're not going to pepper all the channels, but we've already had some channel capability and experience in our international theaters, but we will be adding more to that. So the combination of our own sales and marketing investment in the campus and the channels will be a very important one to step in 2019. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Thank you, Jayshree, and great job. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Andy. Operator : Your last question comes from Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is open. Woo Jin Ho - Bloomberg LP (Research): Oh, hey. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple if I may. So, Jayshree, when you came out with the 100-gig switch, you guys innovated on the network architectures of the cloud. Are there any considerations similar to that with 400-gig switching? And then, Ita, in terms of the deferred revenue uptick, how much of that was the IT related that needs to be Q-ed? And how should we think about the deferred revenue drawdown hitting the P&L over the next couple of quarters? Ita M. Brennan - Arista Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think again the product growth is really related to the requalification. As to when exactly that comes back, it's difficult to tell. And again, that balance will move with new stuff versus old stuff, et cetera. So, I'm not trying to forecast that, if you'd like, as part of this. I will say we're not contemplating a significant downward move in that in our Q4 guide, right? But other than that, I think it's too early to try and forecast it beyond that. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: And Woo Jin, just to wrap up the last question of the Q3. If you look at the way we approached 100-gig, we approached it from a network design perspective, heavy software differentiation, bringing high availability, agility on automation, analytics into our 100-gig platforms, mix and match of both modular chassis and fixed form factor. You can expect us to adopt a similar strategy for 400-gig over the next year. Woo Jin Ho - Bloomberg LP (Research): Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.: This concludes the Arista Q3 2018 earnings call. I want to mention that we also have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section our website.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Business and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of 2019 fiscal year, industry innovations, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. In terms of Q4 specifics, our profitability growth combination was once again demonstrated with our non-GAAP revenue of $595.7 million, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew to a record $2.25. Services contributed approximately 15.5% of revenue, consistent with it being typically higher as a percentage of overall revenue towards the Q4 end of the year. Our margins in a non-GAAP basis were 64.1%, influenced strongly by our performance from our cloud titan vertical. Overall, 2018 gross margins came in at 64.4%. In terms of customer trends, we registered a record number of $1 million customers in Q4, symptomatic of our enterprise vertical momentum. By the end of 2018, we had acquired a cumulative of approximately 5,600 customers with Microsoft at 27% of total revenue. The combination of an unprecedented year with multiple design wins, coupled with the release of deferred revenue due to legal certifications made 2018 a unique one-of-a-kind year at Microsoft. Our use cases are very diverse there. They transcend classical datacenter use cases to regional spine routing and DCI networking. So this often makes it difficult to directly correlate network spend to CapEx of server and storage spend. Without these collective onetime factors, Microsoft would have likely been more in the normal band of teens of revenue, like they have been in prior years. In terms of verticals, Q4 2018 and in fact throughout 2018 cloud titans represented our largest and strongest vertical. They were represented by our top 5 cloud titan customers. The modern high-tech enterprise segment is now our second fastest growing and our second largest segment followed by the tier 2 specialized cloud providers in third place, and the financials and service providers tied for fourth place. Consistent with industry strengths, service providers have been somewhat of a low point for us, with negative annual growth after a very strong 2017. That said, we are pleased with our increased acceptance of our FlexRoute software licenses, growing 50% from 200 customers in 2017 to 300 customers in 2018. Looking at the 2018 year in entirety, the 2018 international contribution was 28% with the Americas coming in at 72%, not too different from prior years. In terms of new products Arista delivered a banner year of disruptive products, redefining networking with highly differentiated EOS stack, CloudVision management software and flagship platforms. The 7280 and 7500 series have become the gold standard in 100 gigabit Ethernet cloud networking. In 2018, we also introduced substantial software innovations. These included containerization, tracers and analyzers. In particular, we have doubled our CloudVision management customers and our Any Cloud segmentation security software with APIs for AWS, Azure and GCP have indeed been transformational. Undoubtedly, 2018 has been a significant year for Arista with revenue of $2.15 billion and an annual growth of over 30%, with substantial contribution from our cloud vertical. At this time, I'd like to invite Anshul Sadana to recap our cloud titan strategy and really highlight our success here. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. While we pioneered our cloud networking mission with 2-tier leaf spine designs, our customers are now using Arista products in a multitude of roles, both within and outside the traditional datacenter boundaries, which we term as PICs or places in the cloud. We are now successfully deployed in many PIC roles, leaf, spine, bare metal, cluster interconnect, regional spine, DCI, metro interconnect, peering spine, private backbone and extended long-haul use cases. Wire speed 256-bit encryption MACsec encryption has secured all traffic that leaves the datacenter facility of our customers. In addition to recent speeds, Arista EOS is strongly preferred for the cloud's mission-critical use cases, due to superior quality, programmability via robust APIs and our EOS SDK. Our state-based real-time telemetry delivers world-class analytics, monitoring and traffic engineering of these networks. All of these compelling advantages have created a collaborative partnership with our cloud customers as a build for next generation architectures with ever increasing workloads. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. Effective March 2019, I'm really pleased to announce the promotion of Anshul Sadana to chief operating officer. In this expanded role, Anshul augments his present worldwide product management and customer facing functions with platform engineering, manufacturing and operations. Anshul, as many of you may know has been a key pillar and contributor at Arista for over 11 years, demonstrating that keen unique sense of product depth driving our consistent differentiation in a typical Arista way. Please do join me in congratulating, Anshul on his very well-deserved promotion. Arista continues to drive cloud area networking where the future of networking is not siloed to a switch or a router box alone, but in fact a software-driven places in the cloud. As we exit 2018, we believe we hold the number one market spot in 100-gigabit Ethernet switching share in port for the high speed datacenter segment. As I have mentioned last year, scaling the company and the team was a stated goal. We accomplished this many ways, including the addition of two senior officers to our executive leadership team, John McCool, our chief platform officer and Manny Rivelo, our newly appointed chief custom officer. We also successfully integrated our first two M&A transactions this year - last year, Mojo Networks for Cognitive Wi-Fi in the campus and Metamako for ultra-low latency networking. Our employee bench strength increased to 2,300 in 2018, from 1,700 in 2017, while maintaining a very high bar for topnotch talent. What is increasingly clear to me is that Arista is gaining strategic relevance and how to seat at the table with enterprises seeking next generation cloud area networking as a compelling alternative. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Ita for more financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2018 results and our guidance for Q1 '19 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, losses related to our private company investments, charges associated with our recent acquisition and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 was $595.7 million, up 27% year-over-year and above our guidance at $582 to $594 million. We experienced good overall demand in the quarter with ongoing strength across the business. Service revenues represented approximately 15.5% of revenue, up from 13.8% last quarter, reflecting a seasonally higher level of renewals in the period. International revenues for the quarter came in at $144.9 million, a 24% of total revenue, down from 28% in the prior quarter. Looking at the year, international mix remained consistent on a year-over-year basis at approximately 28% of total revenue. This reflected strong growth in our international and region businesses, offset by a higher mix of US deployments from our cloud titan vertical. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 64.1%, just above the midpoint of our guidance of 63 to 65, and down from 64.6% last quarter. This reflected a healthy mix of cloud titan revenues in the period and as expected, some incremental costs related to the previously announced trade tariff. While the operations team are making good progress towards mitigating these tariff-related costs, we expect to see some continued impact to the remainder of 2019. In the interim, we will continue to pass a portion of these costs to our customers pending completion of the required supply chain changes. Operating expenses for the quarter were $160.1 million, up from $155.1 million last quarter. R&D spending came in at a $104.9 million or 17.6% of revenue, mostly flat to last quarter on an absolute dollar basis. This reflected higher NRE and prototype spending in the third quarter, offset by ongoing headcount growth in Q4. Sales and marketing expense was $43.8 million or 7.4% of revenue up from $41 million last quarter with increased headcount and related sales costs. Our G&A costs remain consistent at approximately 1.9% of revenue. Our operating income for the quarter was $222.1 million or 37.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $9.5 million and our effective tax rate was consistent at 21.4%. This resulted net income for the quarter of $182.2 million or 30.6%. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.93 million shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter up $2.25 up 31.5% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investment ended the quarter at approximately $2 billion. We generated $296 million of cash from operations in the quarter reflecting strong net income performance combined with improvements in supply chain related working capital and increased deferred revenue amounts. Overall we generated $503 million of cash from operations for the year, which included the payment of the Cisco settlement of $400 million in the third quarter. DSOs came in at 51 days down from 53 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of billings in the quarter. Inventory turns were 3.3 times, up slightly from 3.2 last quarter. Inventory increased to $264.6 million in the quarter, up from $216.3 million in the prior period. This primary reflects increases in raw materials and finished goods as you ramp the supply chain for new products. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we maintained a further $14.6 million of inventory deposit recording another asset at the end of the quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $587.2 million up from $529.9 in Q3. Our product deferred revenue balance increased by approximately $18 million in the quarter effecting customer acceptance requirements on new products. The 2018 closing product deferred revenue balance was again essentially flat the prior year and not a meaningful contributor to revenue for the year. There was however a shift in the customer makeup of the product deferred with Microsoft redesign qualifications representing a significant portion of the 2017 balance, as compared to a negligible amount of Microsoft product deferred at the end of 2018. Accounts payable were 40 days, up 39 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.2 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond, we are pleased with our strong 2018 financial performance, with 31% revenue growth and 42% growth in earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, we believe we are well positioned with our key cloud customers and remain focused on expanding our presence across all of the verticals. Our revenue guidance for the first quarter are $588 million to $598 million, represents 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our gross margin outlook of 63% and 65%, with customer mix being the key driver of where we operate within this range. While we remain cautious in relation to our spending ramp, you should expect to see us make the investments necessary to support the expansion of the business. We believe given some reasonable top-line growth this can be accomplished while maintaining operating margin in the previously discussed approximately 35% range. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $588 million to $598 million; gross margins approximately 63% to 65%; and operating margin of approximately 35%; our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%; diluted shares of approximately 81.4 million. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the queue portion of the Arista earnings. Due to time constraints, I'd like request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes, thank you. Jayshree, I don't know if you guys - I'm not sure you debated this. But have you thought at all about providing some full year guidance for 2019 in terms of revenue? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, Jason, you can well imagine not only have we debated it, I think you all have debated it. If you look back at our 5-year short history since IPO, we have never provided annual guidance. I think we made an exception once, when we felt that consensus was significantly different than our guidance. And therefore, we took exception to that, and wanted to course correct and let you know that it was way off our guidance. So I think you can safely assume that since we're not doing that that we want to go back to our normal mode of quarterly guidance and we're comfortable with your current consensus estimates. Jason Ader : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next - oh, sorry. Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Thanks for taking the question and happy Valentine's Day. Just to Jayshree and Ita here on this Microsoft contribution for 2018, obviously, that's well above what a lot of us were thinking might happen and maybe you could frame for us how cloud titans finished out for great teen, seems like maybe it was pushing 40% of revenue. I'd like to have you comment on that. And how should we think about cloud titan growth in contribution for the year? I know you're not giving guidance, but just help us frame that, because that's a significant upside for Microsoft and sort of our modeling of that. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, so thanks Alex. Happy Valentine's Day to you as well, we love you all. And what I would say in general is this is truly an unprecedented once-in-a-lifetime or one-of-a-kind year with Microsoft. We don't expect that to repeat. We love for that to repeat, but we don't expect that. And we believe they will continue to be 10% concentration customer in 2019, but will go back to a more normal percentage of our revenue. I think the cloud titans as a category did extremely well for us. All 5 major cloud titans that typically contribute to Arista as part of the top 10 customers continue to make important contributions in 2018. We expect there to always be some shift in balance between the 5 and 2019 will likely be different in the contribution of the cloud titan. But I think you're right in assuming that as a category we still expect them to be about a third of our revenue in 2019. And they were higher due to the Microsoft concentration in 2018. Alex Kurtz : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And, Anshul, congrats on the promotion. I just had a question primarily on kind of the prepared remarks that Anshul had about you seeing additional uses of Arista's product in parts of the datacenter and outside the datacenter with the cloud customers that obviously has driven some of the strength here. How broad based is that? Do you see more room with all the cloud titans as well as the tier 2 cloud providers, to see that expand more and probably you - that had to outperform their overall spend on a networking even in 2019? Can you help us think about? Anshul Sadana : Certainly, Samik, you're right. There are many of the expanded use cases that we didn't join into. But as a result of us doing routing, encryption, some of the DWDM products that we have this emitting colored wavelengths, we are now able to participate in an increasing TAM. And in the past, you always considered us just as a switch, but we are now able to take on these higher lid. But in addition to that, it's not just a one for one displacement. These are new architectures that are significantly more resilient. The goal many of the cloud titans have and even the smaller cloud companies, just out of smaller scale, is to not focus on one network that is this mythical [fifty-nine] [ph], but build networks that are parallel architectures, that are highly resilient and be able to do that with our leaf/spine architectures and some of the new use cases, whether it's peering or DCI or regional fabrics, the regional spines; and pretty much the same approach, but expanding to a much wider area within a metro, 100 kilometer plus. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next - oh, sorry - your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. On the tariff that you made comments on during your prepared comments and your outlook, did you mean to say that you're building in the tariff for your revenue outlook and was it the 10% or the potential 25% rate? And is that across all products or just those coming for China, because I'm sure a lot of products that may be assembled in Guadalajara or Florida could actually contain China parts. So can just help us understand how you're navigating through the tariff situation? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, let me Clarify and I'll pass it over to Ita, Jim. What we said in Q3 and we continue to reiterate in Q4 is the impact of tariffs is still very much there in our cost, because many of these components come from China. So even as you move to different contract manufacturers, you can have second derivative effects if you will. Arista's response to that was to absorb some of the cost, but also have a 3.3% tariff fee, assuming the 10% tariff increase. We have made no assumptions on the 25% increase, since there is still a lot of speculation there. Ita, you want to add to that on the impact of that? Ita Brennan : Yeah. I think it applies to products that have components that are actually tariff, right. It doesn't apply on the software and optic system and stuff. And, again, we're making plans, we have the plans for how we start to remediate that with the supply chain. It just takes time to execute on those on those plans, right, you don't move. It takes time to affect the supply chain movement. But we're working on that. We'll share more... Jim Suva : So 25% would be the same methodology as what you did in 10% I would assume. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. We haven't really thought it through or formulated a plan. We're hoping it never happens. But, yes, we would apply something similar. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. It's greatly appreciated. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Congrats, ladies, and Chuck. Thanks, a great quarter. I guess, I want to go back to where we started again, which is the cloud. I just want to make sure I understand your comments, because I mean with Microsoft being 27% on the year. I think you made a comment to the effect that the more normal run rate was the percentage of Microsoft was last year, which was 16%. And so, that implies about 10% is through product defers and delayed certifications, and all of that. And since Microsoft has little to no presence in your product deferred right here right now, stripping that out, your core growth in 2018 was only 20% really outside of the deferred. And I guess, I'm trying to think, help me think about the titan vertical in general. Is that a vertical that grows below corporate average do you think for the year? Are there big parts in your footprint that you feel would be more competitive on the year and how do you feel about your ability to protect them? And clearly, when 400 comes along, there are a lot of vendors are making a lot of claims and you seem to be at the top of the hill. So, clearly, you're right on the target. Jayshree Ullal : Wow, that was a loaded question. Ita, you want to clarify? Ittai Kidron : Yes, I try to portray in there, yes. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, you just succeeded. Thank you for the good wishes. Let me have Ita clarify some of the\u2026 Ita Brennan : Yeah, maybe let's just talk about the deferred piece, just to make sure we're thinking about that the same way. I mean, at the end of the day, deferred revenue, product deferred revenue did not contribute to revenue for the year, right? So if Microsoft, the mix of Microsoft change, and obviously that resulted in Microsoft having a higher percentage of revenue, right? But also the deferred was backfilled with some other activities. So when I think about it on an activity basis, Microsoft's activity in the period was significantly below the 27%, not back to the teens, because we had some good you use cases, et cetera, but significantly below that 27%, just to be clear. So when you think about transactional activity in the period the deferred kind of comes out of that and we did backfill that deferred amount with some other customers, right. Jayshree Ullal : And to answer your question on growth, we obviously don't expect Microsoft to have the same amazing growth in 2018 - 2019 that we had in 2018. But we fully expect the cloud titan category to grow well, if that makes sense. So I think there will be puts and takes in our other contributors and other customers, be it cloud titans or even some other tier 2 cloud providers are going to greatly contribute to our cloud growth. Ittai Kidron : Very good, good luck. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ittai. Ita Brennan : Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal call with Nomura. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kvaal : Yes, thank you very much. And I'm hoping perhaps to ask the question that may be on many of our minds about web scale CapEx and you've touched on it a little bit today, and certainly in the past. But, look, the numbers do seem to be decelerating a decent amount. And I'm wondering if you could help us explain why there is a decent disparity between what the spenders are up to and your revenues. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, Jeff. I'll take a part of the question and I'd like my expert here, our new COO to take the other half. As we tried to explain, we're not able to directly correlate server spend with Arista or networking CapEx spend. And the reason is, obviously a service spend connects to the first point of a network attach, which is typically a leaf switch, but what we're finding is many tiers of leafs and many tiers of spines. And Anshul gave you some examples of regional spine, a core routing spine, a WAN spine, a datacenter interconnect spine, all of those examples and especially the MACsec security, none of them - and peering, none of them have a direct correlation to the first use case we just talked about, which is the server and first Top-of-Rack switch spend. So the one-to-one correlation is difficult. However, I think you can make a correlation if the overall spend is declining then obviously we'll also feel the impact of that, but it's hard to pinpoint and say, a server spend is declining network spend is declining, it's not one-to-one. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Jeff, I'll add a few things here. Number one, last year or the last few quarters, there's been significant volatility in memory prices for servers and that resulted in increased CapEx for many other cloud titans and also resulted in a reduction in cloud CapEx for many of the titans. That has no impact with networking, so as a result we are not correlated there. And second when you look at very large build out of regions, datacenters facilities, all of that often gets counted out as CapEx, but obviously we're just focused on how much networking interconnect you need at different layers of different architectures and hence you'll see less correlation in the short-term. As Jayshree mentioned, in the very long run these things can tie back, but they're not even associated within that one year, and hence the data, but otherwise we've done well technically with the cloud titans and we are happy to compete going forward as well. Thank you. Jeffrey Kvaal : Anshul, do you the networking is gaining share inside of the overall web-scale CapEx? Anshul Sadana : I would say networking from our standpoint, not so I think it's very, very similar to some previous years. However, optics is a different ball game and as you very well known, 400-gig optics are slightly more expensive on a per gigabit basis compared to 100-gig - not per gigabit, per port, and I think that will change some of the equation if it is being allocated to networking, but I don't think our correlations gets changed that way. Jeffrey Kvaal : Thank you, and congratulations on your appointment, Anshul. Anshul Sadana : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette: Great, thank you very much. Anshul, I wanted to follow up on your mention of 400-gig and that coming to market and implementation later this year and through 2020 and beyond. And as you're looking at that, what do you think the appetite is from your customers to mix and match 400-gig with existing 100-gig plan and - because I'm wondering how much opportunity do you see for footprint share shift among in your customers for that? And secondly maybe as you're talking about that, maybe you can also talk through kind of what the use cases are for 400-gig that you think will at least start things going. Jayshree Ullal : James, I'm going to kick it off and then Anshul will get into detail. I think one of the things we have said consistently is that 100 and 400-gig mix and match is going to happen frequently. And in fact, with the exception of the cloud titans that are going to push us more on 400-gig, the mainstream use cases we see in 2019 are still heavily favored by 100-gig. And even as we go into 2020, when the optics become more available, I think you're going to see much more of a combination and that's going to favor Arista because of our incumbency and leadership position in 100-gig. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely. Thanks, Jayshree. So just adding on to what you just heard, in networking you do not introduce a new speed that's not backwards-compatible with the existing installed base, otherwise you'll just never get to get it to work, which is how IPv5 died. Jayshree Ullal : What is IPv5? Anshul Sadana : But if you look at 400-gig in the cloud datacenters and the way the architectures are going on, the hyperscalers are hyperactive with the next gen design and they all have their own problems to solve for different use cases where it's public cloud or storage or video or caching and so on. You can't just touch one intermediate layer and say, I'm done with my 400-gig upgrade, you have to upgrade end-to-end, so there's slow transition and hence the interop is important. I would say interop offer 400-gig uptake back into a DR1 QSFP28 is going to be very, very important even for cloud customers, that's the only way you connect back to the installed base, but because now you're able to touch multiple layers, it takes a long time - several quarters to several years to actually get that upgrade done. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yeah, hi guys, thanks for the question. Congrats to Anshul as well. I wanted to start off, I guess and just since we've talked a lot about datacenter, just ask about campus and see if there's any update on that if you guys have any milestones that you might be able to give us in terms of trials, things like that - how it's going. And then secondly Ita, I just wanted to clarify your comments on seasonality around services, that was quite higher than we anticipated. And I'm wondering are you saying that that's more of a normal seasonal progression of services looking forward or is that an abnormal quarter that we're looking at here. Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yeah, let me take that one first. I mean, I think the 15 and a half is probably high, right. The Q4 tends to be a strong renewal quarter and there's some recognition of revenue that comes along with that so I think back in the 14%, maybe 14 and change is kind of probably a better average for the year, is how you should think about it. Jayshree Ullal : And Rod, to answer your campus question, it's too early for revenue, I think it will be more material in the second half, but we've seen an extremely strong desire to have a viable alternative to the incumbents, in quality, in simplicity, in cognitive capabilities and automation. And I'm going to let our new chief customer officer, Manuel Rivelo speak to it some. Manny? Manuel Rivelo : Yeah, thanks, Jayshree. Rod, good to talk to you. Rod Hall : Thank you. Manuel Rivelo : So Jayshree classified it correctly. It is early days and we see this being material in the second half of 2019, but the initial acceptance has been really well-received by the customers. And I think there's two categories for customers, and the first is our existing installed base. And that installed base is looking to extend EOS across their infrastructure into the campus driving one management plane, cognitive management plane one set of telemetry, one EOS. And they're really looking to for simplicity. They're looking for agility. They're looking for scale and they're looking for quality. The second type of customer running into are customers who haven't done business with that know we're approaching the campus space. And those customers are really looking at us as an alternative because of fatigue. They're seeing in the market segment basically 30 years of lack of innovation, 30 years of stagnant architectures and more and more boxes being pushed out instead of a unified architecture, so we're seeing great traction with those customers early days. But like I said it's early days we got around with the portfolio and bring that to the customer base, but there's a lot of excitement there also. And then just to give you examples of when, I mean, we had various winds throughout the quarter in the campus. One was a million dollar account, which is a multinational beverage company where we basically were driving our campus solutions into that and drove great success into that and we expect to see expansion going on there. And we've also had lots of winds where we began to integrate our Spline architecture inside those use cases, and again for the same reasons scale, quality, fatigue et cetera. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Manny. Rod Hall : Great, I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Right, thank you. Jayshree, I know how much you love to be pinned down, so that we could wind up. Jayshree Ullal : It depends by who? Thanks, Paul. Happy Valentine's Day to you as well. Paul Silverstein : Right, I'm probably back to action. So for the first quarter and the 25% of there about year-over-year guidance that you gave, how do you get there - could you help break it down by customer - I'm not asking by individual customers, but in terms of customer verticals, what drives that growth and then I have a follow up question. Jayshree Ullal : I think - I expect to see a more normal concentration of customer verticals. I think all five will be represented in double digit. Cloud titans will, I think continue to be one, if I had to guess I would say enterprise will continue to be two again and then it's hard to forecast between three, four and five. Does that make you happy? Paul Silverstein : No, not exactly. What I'm trying to get at is, I trust it goes without saying or maybe it doesn't that the customer verticals two to five, your cloud specialist - especially your enterprise service players et cetera that collectively you're expecting the growth rate from that group of customers i.e. the customers other than cloud titans, the increase and you're expecting growth from cloud titans to moderate, is that a fair assumption? Jayshree Ullal : Yes and no. I'm expecting growth from Microsoft to moderate, but I haven't said I'm expecting growth from the cloud titan vertical to moderate. Paul Silverstein : So you're not expecting growth from your other cloud titans to moderate and from your cloud titan verticals collectively. Jayshree Ullal : I didn't say that, no. But I think it's fair to say it will moderate with Microsoft given the once in a lifetime unique year we had here in 2018. So with the exception of - Paul Silverstein : I have a follow up question. Go ahead. Jayshree Ullal : With the exception of Microsoft, we feel very comfortable of our growth in all five verticals, I think that's why - and Paul we can chat about this more, but we should probably allow the next question. Paul Silverstein : Can I just quickly ask you as a follow up, is there anything unique about the first quarter relative to the rest of the year. Ita Brennan : No more than the normal seasonality, right. I think it's always a quarter that tends to be flattish off of Q4, I don't know if there's anything else particularly unique about Q1. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate that, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I think there is most similarities to Q1s with prior Q1, their uniqueness. Paul Silverstein : That's all I need. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. Can we just take a few moments, maybe just to discuss what you're seeing with service provider because the one thing the entire sector seems to be very hyped up about is 5G. And you're seeing it on the ramp side, but there seems to be a big disconnect when we get into the equipment side of the spectrum. Can you just kind of walk us through when you think SP spending towards equipment will start to ramp back up and is this a back half '19 event or is this a 2020 event based on your purview at this juncture? Jayshree Ullal : Sami, I'll take a crack at it and I think Manny and Anshul may help me as well. Look I think given a very small presence in service provider, we don't believe we are affected by macro trends and in our view at least, the influence of Arista gear is not 5G-dependent, because we're really a backhaul for IP routing and ring switching and routing together and providing the scale of routes and IP tables and the ACLs that no one does. That said I don't think - we think 5G is really a move away - 400-gig is 2020, I think we think 5G is 2021. So from our perspective, we've got upside in service provider because we had a very strong 2017. We're disappointed with 2018 and that gives us a chance to grow faster in 2019. We're seeing tremendous activity both in the US and we have put more emphasis in international theaters. Manny, maybe you want to speak to that. Manuel Rivelo : Yeah, no, I - just to add to that. In the use cases that we play and service provider whether it'd be Telco cloud and FEI [ph] or peering we're doing quite well at executing across the globe in various tier I and tier II operators. In other use cases, the portfolio continues to run itself out. It's additional features to cover those use cases, but as Jayshree pointed out, we've also made investments in 2018 for better coverage both on the account manager side and on the SE side to represent those Tier I operators who are getting more fast as it pertains to our piece and proof-of-concept, so we think that that will bode well as we enter 2019 and beyond. Sami Badri : Got it, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Sami. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Hello, guys, thanks for the sweetheart print. We appreciate it. I wanted to ask a question relative to two dynamics and see if you could play them off against each other. So we're definitely hearing a lot of conversations about slowdown in server investments based off of a product cycles at Intel as well as some of the other cycles that are going on. That suggest a slowdown in cloud in the first half of the year and a reacceleration in the back half of the year, so part of the question is, are you seeing that kind of dynamic as well. And then the other side of it, there's a countervailing force, which we're hearing that spending on 100-gig is expected to double year-over-year in terms of port sales. So to the extent that we're seeing a doubling of 100-gig, are you gaining enough share in a 100-gig as a result of your dominance in that space, which I think is two x the share of the overall market - your overall market share and does that offset the divot in demand in the first half in Web 2.0 due to those products cycles? Anshul Sadana : Sure, absolutely. Alex, great questions. And in terms of CapEx for the large cloud titans, we certainly don't have visibility yet into second half. We would love them to forecast accurately as you very well know. On the first half, because we're in so many diverse use cases, we are getting a little bit decoupled in the short-term from the exact server spend. They might be buying fewer racks now, but they're still doing DCI but also other things and so on. But the same time obviously, if they spend more in the long run we could benefit. Now to your point on 100-gig spending or 100-gig ports are doubling - and I would emphasize actually 100-gig ports that are doubling not the spend is because some of the next generation technology is now starting to show up in the market including some of our products, which are really being used not as 400-gig but more cost-effective four by 100-gig, and that allows customers to get many more ports than what they used to be in the past, but that doesn't change the revenue dynamics significantly. It just lowers the ASP and increased the port count. Alex Henderson : But does it change share is the question. Jayshree Ullal : That will depend on our execution, Alex. We've held on to the number one position for two years in a row, hopefully this year will be out there. Alex Henderson : Okay, thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. And also congratulations on good print. I want to go back to the router market, you mentioned in the prepared remarks you've gone from two to 300 FlexRoute customers. It sounds like one of your major silicon providers does a major release starting to shipping volume in Jericho 2 looking towards the mid part of the year, which is very focused on the service provider market. So I'm curious, if we look out over the next 12 plus months, is there a natural expansion story in the router functionality that expands your opportunity set in that incremental growth driver going forward? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Aaron. I think it's a really good question. I believe we have a national expansion even before Jericho 2, which has had to do with a lot of our FlexRoute features and the 50% growth of our customers from 200 to 300. So at least in 2019, I see that more immediate success will be not necessarily waiting for the next generation of silicon, but really going into these 200 to 300 customers and enabling greatest success, many of who are service providers. Now after that the Jericho 2 cycle, which really hits in the second half of the year - Ashul is confirming, I think we can have a multi-year success in routing in 2020 and beyond with Jericho 2. Aaron Rakers : And I'm just kind of curious, how much opportunity do you see that total addressable router market today and how much do you think is that going to expand? Jayshree Ullal : It's a tough one to answer. The total market is $8 billion, but I think our TAM is more like two to three - it's a good guess. But some of them end up being very specific, traditional legacy MPLS traffic engineering boxes - Arista, doesn't play in that but as they look to come in as Manny was describing into the spine peering and interconnect and NFV and Telco cloud, Arista is a national player to combine the universal spine switching and routing. Aaron Rakers : Right, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold: Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could, maybe take a look at getting some thoughts on 2020 in particular, if I characterize your base business as put to side and thinking about three growth engines - campus switching, routing and 400-gig switching as the incremental part, how do you see those three in terms of rank order contributors in 2020? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Wow, you get the prize for the tough question so far, right up there with Paul. Simon M. Leopold: I'm honored. Jayshree Ullal : We'll give it our best but this is purely a forecast. I think if you look at TAM, the largest TAM of these three - campus, routing and 400-gig is campus. And it's also the most underserved by any alternative competitor, because it's so deeply embedded by incumbency. So we believe our largest strength and opportunity is campus and our largest pressure to execute is also campus, if I put that in that way. And then I think if I had to split the two, I would say routing second than 400-gig third, because I think routing really doesn't come in - 400-gig doesn't really come into play in a huge way until 2020. Simon M. Leopold: That's very much what I was looking for, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Michael Berg : Hey, this Michael Berg going for Erik Suppiger. Congrats on a great print. I just wanted a quick question on international, could you pull any color around what may have caused the weakness there, I mean was it around international cloud spending or enterprise spending, what do you think your own international in the quarter. Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean you know the mix between international and U.S. in any given quarter is going to be pretty volatile, right. If you look at it for the year, which I think is kind of more interesting and you peel it back, you've got good growth in the in-region businesses and then just a heavier deployment of cloud in the U.S. than what we saw last year, right. We had seen some pretty heavy international cloud activity last year, this year it's been more U.S. focused, right so I think that's probably the biggest driver. If I strip all that out and look at the growth in the region those businesses are going faster than the corporate average. I think Manny, if you want to chime in as well. Manuel Rivelo : Yeah, I think what I'll add on top of that and I think Jayshree said it and Ita said as well, is we are actually seeing great and we're making a significant investment in our international markets from a headcount perspective. We're bouncing that out fairly nicely approximately 40% is going to international headcount, that's a little higher than what you're seeing from a percentage of business. But what's more interesting is the net new logos where we are seeing a lot of new winds there approximately half of our net new logos are coming out of the international market so having a great traction there, great acceptance of technology. You could argue in some of the international markets they're a little behind in the adoption of spine leaf architectures, but they're coming along quite nicely and we think that's a growth engine also for the future. Michael Berg : Okay, great. And then a quick follow up on the Microsoft piece, I know you mentioned that if you normalize it, it's closer to the 16%, but if I'm thinking about the deferred revenue piece being a big contributor wouldn't that leave it to be closer to 18-20% percent or how can I think about how deferred contributed to Microsoft in the year? Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean I don't know they're going to put specific numbers on it, but I think it was a it was a good strong Microsoft year just from an organic business perspective and it would have been well ahead of the 16% in any case. But again a chunk of what the 27 came from the deferred. Jayshree Ullal : And I think the other way to think of this is, that in many ways we did get six quarters of business in four quarters, right, because of the deferred and because of the legal certifications. So it was unusual in every manner, right, not just the deferred, but the legal certifications, the new roles and the time at which you could recognize it, even though the activity began much before. Michael Berg : Okay. And then I think someone asked this before, but is it fair to assume that the cloud titans vertical was closer to 40 or even higher percentage of total revenue for the year, given the high Microsoft contribution? Jayshree Ullal : I think around there is a fair guess. Michael Berg : Okay, awesome. Well, hey, congrats on great quarter again and thank you for the time. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Great. Thank you very much. Could you comment a bit about expenses going forward? You had a year-over-year acceleration in marketing, a deceleration in R&D, which you talked about a little bit. What sorts of growth rates or percentages of revenue can we look forward to? And your longer term target of 32% operating margin, what's the timeframe for that? Is it going to be within my lifetime? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, it depends how long you live. Yeah, surely it's been a while since you updated the\u2026 Steve Milunovich : I'm getting up there. Jayshree Ullal : It's a long-term model and we'll take the opportunity to do that at some point here. I mean, I think what we're seeing is in the near-term timeframe, the plus or minus 35% operating margin is a good way to think about it. And that allows us to see some movement of gross margin quarter-over-quarter and make the investments that we want to make, right. I mean, if we're - yeah, we're still in a situation where we're growing the top line at the rate that we're growing the top line at. It's letting us to and make the investments that we need to make. It's that Manny do what he needs to do in the sales and marketing side. And I think you will see that kind of be maybe more of a percentage of revenue than it has been. And maybe we get a little bit of leverage on the R&D, but that's not going to be the same every quarter and it's not significant, right. And I think about the 35% plus or minus. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open. Srini Pajjuri : Thank you for taking my question, and congrats, Anshul, congrats on the great quarter as well. Just one clarification maybe for Ita. Would it be possible to give us what Microsoft was in Q4 or even second half versus first half as a percent of sales? Ita Brennan : Yeah, I don't think we're going to do that, right. It moved around. Yeah, it's not really helpful to start to try and do that on a quarterly basis. I think the annual number is really the way to think about it and then take some off the top for the deferred, for the release of the legal related certification stuff at the beginning of last year. And so think about 16% was our norm, for the last couple years. I think it was a good strong year for Microsoft on top of that just from a transactional business perspective. Srini Pajjuri : Okay. Then, maybe, a follow up, I guess, on 400 gig, Jayshree, I think Cisco yesterday said they're expecting volume deployment sometime middle of this year. And you seem to think it's more likely in 2020. I just want to understand why you think it's little later than Cisco. I know Juniper said it's also 2020. But I'm wondering why there will be a difference between their timing and your timing. Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think we actually, Srini, sell to some of the world's leading early adopters a 400 gig. And where, Anshul and the team are seeing traction is in the cloud titan vertical. We work with a multitude of optics vendors and we see that as the longest pole in the tent. So while we absolutely expect to see early trials in the second half we would be responsible to tell you we're going to see a large market in the second half. So I guess you could chalk it down to our responsibility. Anshul Sadana : Maybe if I can add something here. We should not confuse product availability versus high volume deployment. These are two different things. Jayshree Ullal : Very good point and products have been available since the beginning of the year. Srini Pajjuri : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Srini. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey, ladies, congrats on a great quarter. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, James. James Fish : I guess, a lot of questions have been asked already, but maybe asking it a different way, what are you hearing from hyperscalers on the 400G optics and potential mix between the OSFP and the QSFP? And secondly on 400G, competitively do you fear in terms of white box offering more or do you fear like the Ciscos and Junipers of the world? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Wow. That is two unique questions. Anshul Sadana : So, James, in terms of first optics on 400 gig OSFP versus DD, in the cloud titans, there's a lot of interest in moving the world forward, and planning it out many years in advance, so that you can actually move to the next generation. So in fact it's the hyperscalers where there's a lot of interest in OSFP. At the same time, we are cognizant that some of the customers need DD based products, so we'll build those as well. But as you may recognize, DD has a short life cycle, because after the [fifty-thirty] [ph] cycle, it can't really work. So then the world has to move forward. So we'll do both. We believe there will be a very healthy mix and good attach rate of OSFP here. With respect to the white boxes, we've touched on this many, many times. We're very competitive in this market. And as we mentioned before, we're not really - customers are not looking to just buy a cheap white box and then do something cool with it. They want to solve real world problems. But they are co-developing with us and partnering with us to solve these problems, taking parts or all of EOS and building on top of that. And as you can see, our business is very healthy with them. And despite all the noise, we feel good about our position there. Jayshree Ullal : And I think the noise in general has reduced a lot. We haven't, we don't hear white box from our customers very much anymore. So to answer your question more directly, it's usually a competitive position against a specific vendor like Cisco, rather than the description or discussion of a white box. James Fish : Yeah. That's great fellows. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto : Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats, Anshul and Manny. Jayshree and Anshul, how should we think about market opportunity and dynamics in 2019, like first specifically about macroeconomic uncertainties? Cisco stated there was no change in demand and no impact from macro uncertainties in their last quarter. I'm wondering like how similar your experience was in Q4. And then second how do you characterize market opportunity in 2019 versus 2018? Are there more similarities or are there more new opportunities versus 2018 that investor and analyst should think about? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Thanks, Hendi. Well, I would say Arista has not seen any macroeconomic uncertainty either in Q4. I think obviously we're not a bellwether here. But as far as our customers have been signaling to us, our enterprise momentum hasn't been stronger. And we continue to see strength there in Q4 and we look forward to that strength continuing in 2019. I'm going to let Anshul answer the 2019 trend. Anshul Sadana : Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Hendi. We haven't seen much of a big change in terms of perception. I think people are certainly worried that if there's a slowdown there will be a correction. Our customers do talk about it, but nothing material has happened so far. I think I've been watching these trends very carefully. Beyond that, the actual opportunity hasn't changed for us. It's a very large TAM we're catering to. And when you look at enterprises there is still a very, very healthy opportunity ahead of us. The same is true in the tier 2 and the specialty providers, as well as financials, and even more expansion possible for us in future in ASPs. So we still feel very good about the opportunity. We believe the market has multiple players. But we are a very, very strong competitor in this space and hence the opportunity to grow. Hendi Susanto : Thank you and great performance. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Hendi. Operator : Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open. John Marchetti : Thanks very much. Jayshree, I was wondering if you could just spend a little bit of time here on the enterprise market. We spend a lot of time on where the cloud titans in terms of their 100 gig adoption and maybe their shift to four. I was wondering maybe you could spend just a minute or two, discussing sort of how you're expecting that enterprise market to kind of follow sooner and where you think that market is kind of overall with its adoption of 100 gig. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, John. I'm actually glad you asked this question, because, yeah, we tend to focus on the cloud titans a lot. But one of the things we're seeing, it is one of our second largest and fastest growing vertical. And there's a very strong interest in bringing those same cloud principles into the datacenter in the enterprise. And it really comes in three flavors, first, how to build a private cloud with leaf/spine architectures and scale out the same way, albeit in smaller scale. The second is to bring - to mimic some of the cloud management principles with the CloudVision, bringing change control, automation, network-wide analytics, et cetera. And the third is the hybrid cloud. No company is better positioned than Arista, as we have deployed in both the public and the enterprise, and bringing those two together from a workload point of view. So the combination of our vEOS Router with the right APIs to multiple public cloud vendors has been very transformational and well received. And finally, of course, the fourth, which I don't want to over talk, but will really come to play in the second half of this year is the campus. So when you look at our whole PINs to PICs transformation, there's at least four different use cases in the enterprise that are exciting. John Marchetti : Thanks. So maybe just as a quick follow up there. Given that they're looking at a lot of these different applications or use cases for the first time. Does that lend itself to maybe some additional service sales or almost from a consulting type of standpoint as you look to help them migrate to these types of solutions. Jayshree Ullal : I think we definitely Arista has looked at it in a - to be more of a consultative approach, provide the right training. And the professional services varies, we often partner with someone or they look for us to come in. Manny, I don't know if you have more to add to that. We don't see a pattern yet. Manuel Rivelo : Yeah, I mean, in general it's an education for the customer base, as they transform their infrastructures into a much more digital framework, they're going to need these modern datacenters, no different than the cloud providers. So those solutions are proven and tested. And we can deliver those. Then the delivery of that solution to the customer either comes through development effort, education, training that we can provide and/or through our professional services and/or our partner network that could offer those services. So we have a lot of flexibility there. And we're seeing that being pretty well accepted across all three of those spectrums. John Marchetti : Thanks very much. Chuck Elliott : This concludes the Arista Q4 2018 earnings call. Thank you for all the good questions and for the opportunity to highlight our financial results and corporate achievements for you. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you during the quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product & Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2019. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of 2019 fiscal year; industry innovation; our market opportunity; the benefits of recent acquisitions; and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Charles. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter of 2019 earnings call. Our profitability growth combination was once again demonstrated with a non-GAAP revenue of $595.4 million, while non-GAAP earnings per share grew to a record $2.31. Services contributed approximately 15% of revenue. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.5% influenced by a strong performance from both our enterprise vertical and services. We registered a record number of million dollar customers in Q1 just as we did in Q4 2018 and we continue to drive our new customer expansion at the rate of one to two per day. In Q1 2019, the cloud titan segment was our largest vertical. The modern enterprise segment is now consistently our second largest with financials in third place supported by a strong solid contribution from our Metamako acquisition. Tier 2 cloud specialty providers and service providers came in at fourth and fifth place. In terms of geography in Q1 2019, the international contribution was 26% with the Americas coming in at 74%. We delivered two major new product announcements during Q1 with 7368 Spline that we developed in close collaboration with Facebook enabling both our flagship EOS as well as Facebook's OS to be supported on the platform. We also introduced the 7130, the first low latency high precision network application platform. We're pleased with the increased acceptance of our software subscriptions with a record quarter for CloudVision having doubled our bookings from Q1 2018. While 2019 is off to a decent start, we are experiencing somewhat of a speed bump in Q2 2019. We saw less than the normal order strength in late March and in the month of April. We are therefore forecasting slower growth in Q2 2019 from our normal and historical patterns. Some of the contributing reasons for this are one the massive cloud titan providers fulfilled in 2018 have led to a period of absorption in the first half of 2019. In particular, one cloud titan has placed most orders on hold for Q2 2019. We note the lackluster performance of the service provider vertical and this \u2013 we forecast this to continue in Q2 2019 consistent with industry trends. To put the volatility of the cloud spend into perspective, as I have shared with you many times, cloud titans typically give us one to two quarters of forecast. And this time, we're seeing a decreased demand in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018. Meanwhile, our enterprise momentum is healthy and very much in its early innings. Our investments from prior years to the present are now paying off. These enterprises typically require contracts, training as well as the deployment of Arista\u2019s new programmable FTN technologies and can take typically a year or more in sales cycles. We do expect 2019 to be a crucial year for both the enterprise data center and campus in terms of customer acceptance. As we look ahead, our new product introductions are slated to ramp in the second half of 2019. And we expect this to create uptick in demand. You will, of course, hear more about our new product pipeline and customer momentum at our June Analyst Day. But in summary we foresee a bright opportunity ahead in cloud area networking in the second area networking in the second half of 2019 personally. I'm excited by our prospects here as customers migrate to a cloud like strategy with their unwavering belief in Arista\u2019s superior quality and technology. And with that I like to turn it over to Ita for more financial metrics. Ita Brennan : Thanks Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2019 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were $595.4 million, up 26% year-over-year and above the mid-point of our guidance of $588 million to $598 million. Service revenues were strong representing approximately 15.1% of revenue, down from 15.5% last quarter reflecting a healthy level of renewals for the period. International revenues for the quarter came in at $156 million, or 26% of total revenue, up from 24% in the prior quarter. Overall, gross margin in Q1 was 64.5% above the mid-point of our guidance range of 63% to 65% and up from 64.1% last quarter. Gross margin in the period benefited from healthy enterprise and service contributions combined with a continued focus on cost optimization. Operating expenses for the quarter were $160.7 million, essentially flat to last quarter on an absolute dollar and percentage of revenue basis. R&D spending came in at $106.5 million, or 17.9% of revenue, up slightly from last quarter. We continue to see significant new products related NRE and prototype spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $43.6 million, or 7.3% of revenue. Again essentially flat to last quarter with increased headcount offset by some reductions in other sales costs. Our G&A costs were $10.5 million or 1.8% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $223.6 million, or 37.5% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $11.2 million and our effective tax rate was lower at approximately 20%. The lower tax rate primarily reflected the finalization of certain tax reform positions based on updated IRS in the regulatory guidance. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $187.7 million, or 31.5%. Our diluted share number for the quarter is 81.2 million shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.31, up 39.2% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.2 billion. We generated $170 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting strong net income performance offset by new product rated working capital increases and a reduction in overall deferred revenue amounts. DSOs came in at 41 days, down from 51 days in Q4, reflecting strong collections activity of the timing of billings in the quarter. Inventory turns were 2.5 times, down from 3.3 times last quarter. Inventory increased to $347.2 million in the quarter, up from $264.6 million in the prior period. This primarily reflects increases in raw materials and finished goods as we ramp the supply chain for new products. Our total deferred revenue balance was $536.5 million, down from $587.2 million in Q4. Our product deferred revenue balance decreased by approximately $80 million in the quarter affecting customer acceptances of new features. This trend is consistent for 2018 and we also had a significant reduction of product deferred revenue in the first half of the year. Accounts payable days were 38 days down from 40 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.2 million. In addition, we announced today that our board of directors has authorized a three year $1 billion stock repurchase program. This allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically and will be funded from working capital. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. As we look forward, we believe that we remain well positioned with our key cloud customers and our focus on expanding our presence in the enterprise and other verticals, especially as we bring new products to market in the second half of the year. While we executed well across all key financial metrics in the March quarter, we saw some shortfall in demand at the back end of the period primarily from our service provider and cloud verticals. Our second quarter guidance assumes this trend continues through the June quarter and we are managing the business on the assumption there maybe some impact for the full year. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix being the key driver and indicating towards the upper end of the range for Q2 2019. We continue to invest in the expansion of the business including the addition of sales headcount and resources. We believe that with reasonable top-line growth, we continue to maintain operating margins at or above the previously discussed 35% range. With this as a backdrop, our guidance of the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes our non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $600 to $610 million, gross margin of approximately 64% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 36%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% with diluted shares of approximately 81.7 million. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time consent as I should request that everyone should limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Jason, we don't hear you. Charles Yager : So we come back to Jason. Operator : All right, just one moment here. Okay, Jason Ader your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Let's go to the next one. Charles Yager : Let\u2019s go to the next one. Jayshree Ullal : Operator, we still don\u2019t hear anybody. Operator : Sorry. I the leader view, actually I'm frozen here. Just give me one second, sorry. Your next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh [UBS]. Your line is open. Tejas Venkatesh : Thanks for taking my question. I did want to dig in a little bit more into the 2Q guidance. Given that in 1Q cloud titans were still the top verticals. Should we think that this is basically one cloud vendor and the others are pretty healthy? And then I also noticed that the Tier 2 cloud in terms of rankings a little bit below where it used to be. So are you seeing weakness there as well? And service provider I think was weak in 2018 also. So coming off somewhat of a weak there, so perhaps you could talk about what's going on there as well. Thank you so much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tejas. I think you successfully combine three questions in one. I'll do my best to answer all three. I think in terms of cloud titans for Q2, one in specific is going to contribute greatly to our different guidance than was expected, but it isn't limited to one. There are multiple in there. Some are doing well and some are not. So as you add the puts and takes, its overall a net negative. We still expect it to be the number one vertical in spite of everything. It's a strong vertical for us. We see a lot of demand. We see strength in products. We\u2019re competitively very strong in superior there. In terms of the Tier 2 cloud specialty providers, they continue to do \u2013 okay, I think the message you should read there is that our enterprise and financials are stronger, not so much that the cloud specialty is weak. And that was to be expected as we start getting broader in the enterprise and as the Metamako acquisition came in. Service providers, nothing new, you are right 2018 was a disappointment as we said so in the last call. And it's an industry trend. And Q1 was no different and I'm not sure Q2 will be any different. I expect it to be the last vertical in the segment. Charles Yager : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. I believe Jayshree you mentioned that you typically get one to two quarters of visibility from your cloud titans. So at this point when we're talking here today in May, have they given you any new indications that the digestion will be completed as we kind of exit the June-July time period? Or is it still a little bit of risk or uncertainty? We're just trying to understand your conviction for the second half of the year. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jim. I think we're forming our conviction for the second half of the year. We don't have a direct answer. As you can tell, we have six weeks of data, six weeks, so even though quarter don't make a trend. We do believe the digestion will complete by the end of Q 2. What we don't have clear visibility to is the new demand for second half of the year. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details. It's appreciated. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on the revenue trajectory. Last quarter, you guys made a public statement saying that you were comfortable at least with the consensus estimates for the full year. At that time, it was kind of around 21% give or take. Is that still the case? Or would you assume that the numbers should come down from that? Jayshree Ullal : Mitch, first of all, I think the numbers should definitely come down for Q2 and for further detail I think we would want to be \u2013 we're watching this closely, we want to be vigilant and we really don't want to form an opinion until we have more data and can make one definitively. So things were fine when we talked to you at the last call on Valentine's Day and much of the change happened in the second half of March. Mitch Steves : Got it. And then just one quick one on the buyback just a clarification there, it\u2019s opportunistic there. What's like the rough metric you guys are using to that \u2013 I guess internally in terms of what you believe opportunistic is in terms of buying the stock? Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean, we haven't disclosed those externally. We're not planning to disclose that externally. I mean, again, we're putting the facility in place, so that we have the freedom to buyback the stock when we feel it's the right time, but we haven't set any hard limits on what that will be. Jayshree Ullal : I think it's important to look at this as a framework and then the specifics will happen as they happen. Mitch Steves : Got it, thank you. Charles Yager : Next question. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Mitch. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thank you, ladies. I guess, going back to the cloud, Jayshree, I understand the pause. I guess maybe you can help me get some comfort that this is a pause and not something else. How do you \u2013 what is it that gives you comfort that this is not a design loss? Can you potentially tie the pause to an architectural change that would explain such a pause? Historically, you've also mentioned that \u2013 you always mentioned that you're very tied, very closely. You have people actually working at your customers that you have large cluster of cloud customers on premise. So they can see the build, as they can see when something runs just perhaps a bit too hot, too cold, a bit too far from a build standpoint. So I'm just again trying to understand \u2013 maybe can you give me some color that makes me feel that this is again a speed bump and not a loss of design to change in architecture or something else. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, yeah, a fair point Ittai. As you know, things were fairly linear when we talked to you. In fact we were feeling quite confident. And we experienced a sudden change in mid March and a sudden slow down in order especially from the cloud titans. So while I would love to give you a comfort, we are watching, we're not concluding, one quarter for that matter, six weeks, don't conclude a trend. But we felt it was really prudent for us to reflect that the health of the cloud titan business suddenly shifted in six weeks, right. So in terms of answering your question on market dynamics, we don't believe they've changed. It's important to note that we're not experiencing any competitive dynamics that are different from the normal cycle. We continue to gain share and have a tremendous opportunity both in the cloud data center and new markets at the campus. So I wouldn't read anything into this six week except, as I said, especially one cloud titan specifically slowed down and paused most orders in Q2. And those kinds of things have an impact on our guidance. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just to being dead horse here, obviously, you guys have had cloud titans in your forecasting process for many years now, as Ita just said, you're very close to the accounts. So, I guess what \u2013 what caught you guys off guard as far as, either rolling up the forecast from the sales organization and not seeing this coming, because obviously there's been volatility in the past with these accounts. And I think we're all just trying to understand what, what changed from kind of your prior process around pipeline management? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Alex, that's a good question. I'm going to ask Anshul, who is the closest to our newly appointed COO, but the one who lives in breeze is daily to give you a color, Anshul do you want to say more? Anshul Sadana : Sure. So Alex, we\u2019re continuing to win and rear throws other cloud companies, both within the data center as well as DCI. There's really no real change there. However, one of the cloud companies are spending in Q2, but some are just not spending. And that was a very hard shift. that they made in late March as we\u2019ve mentioned. That's all that there is to it. We still work very closely with these companies. The joint R&D is great like you saw with our co-development with Facebook. So, the previous team, there's no real shift in designs on architecture, we think very well, they are still getting all the designs that we have been willing and more. But some of these companies simply pause, absorbing their own inventory buildup up, and hence there's just not spending. Alex Kurtz : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question guys. I guess I won't beat the dead horse anymore. I want to ask about the \u2013 I do want to ask about, I think the comment you've made before Jayshree suggested that maybe you're rethinking the full-year growth, though. And then I just want to be clear that you, at this point you guys may come back to us with an update on what you think that growth is. And then the second question, I have is on service providers. I kind of thought of service providers, you felt that it bottomed out and you're calling it out as a little bit of a negative in the guide. I don't know is it a small negative or, if serves providers continue to weaken out from under you in a way that you maybe didn't anticipate? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Yes. Rod, I think first of all, thank you for not asking the same question. So at least you have some diversity and understanding, we've answered it already as best we can. Specific to the full year. Ita, I don't know if you want to comment, but I think at this point \u2013 this concluding the full year would with six weeks of data would not be correct. We\u2019re concluding Q2 from a guide and we'd like your patients and we'd like our vigilance in deciding how it flows through the year. Ita, you want to comment on that? Ita Brennan : Yes, I think Rod, the only thing I'd add is I think from spend perspective, from the terms of managing the business, I mean we are \u2013 obviously, we see what we see for Q2, but we are managing that cautiously as we looked to the back half of the year. Again, not because we necessarily have any clear visibility to plus or minus, we think that's just prudent. So you will see us kind of invest the sales side and drive some leverage on the R&D side, and help kind of manage earnings in EPS, until we know where we stand. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And regarding as a service providers. No, I would say it contributed a little bit to Q1. We expected to contribute a little bit to Q2, but the largest shortfall was due to the cloud titans. Rod Hall : Could you get update on campus? I mean, I know you want a couple of people last time. Any, any updates there? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think \u2013 I\u2019d say two things. You'll hear more about this from our June Analyst Day. We want to get into more detail there. But the two things are generally say is the Mojo acquisition has been very successfully integrated and that is playing, that they've seen a lot more activity in campus from that. But we're also seeing a lot of fundamental cognitive architectural activity, customers are really liking our approach to a campus design much more focused on clients steering better service assurance, native OpenConfig support. Our X3 splines that our competitors are playing catch up to a year later has been very well received and deployed. And finally, CloudVision for the campus is really coming onto the zones. So more in June, but a very promising start. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, I'm going to ask knowing what the answer is, but any \u2013 can you give us any sense for how much revenue you can generate in campus, either in a range or point number, what you're thinking for the year? Jayshree Ullal : Paul, actually I do want to answer that question, but can I do so at the Analyst Day? Paul Silverstein : That's what I figured. Jayshree Ullal : Better than saying never. Right? Paul Silverstein : I appreciate that. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Paul Silverstein : Then I'll apologize if I may. I\u2019m going to go back to the questions been asked during June. My simple question is, you referenced one particular cloud titan is going cold Turkey and the others, I don't know if you were referencing all the others are most of the others as having \u201cpause\u201d, the material difference\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Sorry, let me just correct you Paul. We said one particular cloud titan put most of the orders on hold in Q2. But we also said some of the cloud titans are doing well in Q2. And then I think one or two others are \u2013 they haven\u2019t put their orders in hall, but are not doing as well as we'd expect them to. So if you sort of balance the pluses and minuses, out of the five cloud titans we had two doing well, two not doing well and one neutral, something like that. Paul Silverstein : All right. In the difference between the two that were so much soft, to the one that was \u2013 it sounds like just stopped. With the other two, you think that's also digestion of previous deployments as they catch up to demand or there's something different going on there? Jayshree Ullal : No, we don't think it's all related to digestion. We think it's a combination of digestion and their own decisions and how to spend CapEx. Paul Silverstein : And you think the CapEx decisions or just timing decisions or something else? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. When did they put their new data centers? When did they spend? When did they have leases and etcetera. And you know, as a generally we don't correlate exactly to a quarter, but eventually we correlate. Meaning you can see a significant shift from all the earnings calls you've seen on the cloud titans and the CapEx spend reducing from 2018 to 2019. So absorption \u2013 the completion of absorption will affect us some, but we will also \u2013 I would also like to see them spend more in 2019 and currently they're spending less, some of them. Paul Silverstein : Okay. And just one quick final question for me. On the service providers, a little bit surprised to hear you call it out in the sense that service providers has been \u2013 if I'm not mistaken, is proven to be more challenging than you old thoughts from the get go. That doesn't sound like it's new and different. So when you talk about softness and service provider, you are talking about softness versus your expectations. And I assume that in turn, at least implies that it softens even further than the previous challenges you've found in terms of how far, how fast your penetration, I mean you\u2019re new player in the market when you first came in. So you should obviously gain, the total, the nature of the demand should be relatively less important in terms of your progression. I recognize it's not immaterial. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Paul Silverstein : But again, the simple question would be, did it soften further? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Paul Silverstein : One word answer. Jayshree Ullal : Simple answer in one word is, yes. Paul Silverstein : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. So, I wanted to rather than talk about revenue trends, maybe see if you could shed some light on your expense trends. And specifically where I'm going with this line of questioning. It is to get a better sense of really what you need to do to expand markets. So to get beyond the cloud is for things like success in campus. I noted you had relatively high sales and marketing back in the December quarter, a little bit lighter this quarter, but the trend is higher. Help us understand what you need to do to, to broaden your marketplace and be successful and areas like campus from a \u2013 from an expense perspective? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Simon, I think Manny covered this, and Anshul, maybe you want to add to it. But I think that's three things, we are doing and we need to continue to do in the campus to get stronger. The first is, we just have to invest more in enterprise coverage across the world. We're stronger in the U.S. and internationally, but the global footprint, every, every single major company has a campus. So we've got tremendous cam there, and tremendous opportunity and we got to put more feet on the street. So you watch us continue to invest there. And I think canvas will be actually more of a horizontal opportunity for us more than just a vertical opportunity. So that's one. The second and important thing we have to also do is, win quickly with the customers who are most familiar with us. The 5,000 customers who know and love and appreciate EOS, and the quality and the single binary image and the CloudVision, state oriented management and change control. This will be an important much for us to have customer wins there, because they obviously have already worked with us. And the final is, not everything can be a direct customer touch you. You will see Manny and Anshul and the team investing heavily in a very, razor sharp focused on channels. Not, not all channels are equal, but a combination of lead channels as well as regional channels, and geographies and perhaps even some systems integrators will be important. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : We talk more about this on the Analyst Day as well. And we talk about campus overall. Simon Leopold : Any chance, we could maybe get a little bit of quantification around the rate of hiring or rate of expense growth we should expect for the year, what you're budgeting for? Jayshree Ullal : I think, from a budget perspective it's going to be doubled what we did last year in people. Ita Brennan : Yes. And I think what you should expect Simon as you know, will at least from the foreseeable future, we'll look to kind of leverage, drive some leverage in R&D to kind of offset that income from spending on sales and marketing. And then, we'll see as the top line \u2013 we see what happens at the top line. We can \u2013 we'll revisit that. But I think, sales and marketing go-to-market, investments are the priorities from our perspective at this point. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. I wanted to try to avoid killing a different horse that I'm going to change topics. So the question I have is like, when you look at your non-camp, or your non-cloud titan on a service provider customers and that group, you\u2019ve have indicated that those continue to do well. I'm wondering if you can give some color in terms of makeup of customers, if that's changing at all, and what's going on from a geographic basis. And in where you're maybe seeing strength or kind of what \u2013 how that's evolving on a geography-by-geography basis? And then just a quick other question for Ita is that versus our model, at least your tax rate was a lot lower this quarter than we have modeled. And I'm just wondering something was happening there, and how we should think about that going forward? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes, maybe I'll take that one first. So we did \u2013 we did finalize some tax positions around [indiscernible] and some other stuff that came out of the tax reform this quarter and that\u2019s our reduction. So it was actually a 20% in Q1. I think structurally over time it's probably higher than that. We guided 21% for Q2, I think that's probably a good place to be until we see how it settles in. But it's come down off of, we were in a 61.5% type range, so we've come down from that. So I think 21% is probably a good place to be now. James Faucette : Okay. Okay. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks James. To answer the question. I didn't have all the information at my fingertips, but what we're seeing is a very healthy uptick and logos, both in the United States as well as in EMEA. So, new logos are trending well in Q1, and we expect that to continue through 2019. In terms of new verticals, we don't see a trend, but we definitely seeing strength in media, entertainment, financials, healthcare, these tend to be a top three verticals I think at the moment. And no reason we wouldn't start seeing more in education and some of the other places as well. High-tech enterprise generally is a strong vertical for us. So I think we're continuing to make our verticals horizontal, if you will. They get participating in more customers and more, mid-to-large enterprises. Anshul, you had a good statistic on how many Fortune 5000 and Global 2000 are in and, that would be a good data point. Anshul Sadana : Sure. At this time, roughly 25% of the Fortune 500 or the risk to customers, and just under 20% of the Global 2000 our risk to customers. And these statistics have been improving every quarter. We are winning in the broader enterprise as well. Not just our initial verticals. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. That's very promising. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. First I always thought that making us work on the Valentine's Day evening is a bad karma and now got my confirmation for that. Jayshree Ullal : All right. Tal Liani : I want to ask \u2013 yes, yes. Next time, don't do it that night. Next, I want to ask a question on your routers. You said before that, service providers have \u2013 still difficulties to accept or to take your vision for the routers, that you're seeing more difficulties to sell routers to service providers than you had anticipated. Can you give us an update on what's their vision and if there's any change in the willingness of providers to take your 75 hour. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. That's a good question, Tal. So, I think that's really a fundamental difference between routers and routing. Routers is we're both the time where you had different kinds of LAN and WAN interfaces. Generally low port density, generally 10 to 100 to X the price per port. And generally custom A6 . And what Arista has done is, to shifted that to modern merchant silicon, whether it's Jericho or Jericho plus or Jericho NextGen in the future. And cut down the number of layers, and but service providers, unlike the cloud providers have needed more time to operationalize it. They believe the strategy, they can't go as fast on the implementation. However, we had a success with a couple of use cases. Anshul, you want to comment on that? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Absolutely. Look the RFP cycles and the contract cycles are fairly long for the service provider. So we do have lots of international activity, but the sales cycles are longer. In the U.S. the MSOs are steady state with us. So we do well over there. We do well in the Telco cloud, which is the data center part of the Telco cloud. But the rest of the Telco is what's been slow. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And because they have an old RFP and we have a new RFP. So they haven't jived. Tal Liani : Got it. Can I ask a follow-up question on something that everyone asked, but I have it. I want to look at it differently. There is one big customer that grew a 100% plus for you. And it will \u2013 we will understand if that customer is pausing, because it's abnormal to see this kind of growth. The question is, what is the growth in cloud in aggregate? If you remove that specific customer in aggregate, did this group grow or not grow this quarter or the guidance, I mean? Anshul Sadana : Yes. I don't know that, we're going to right that out at this point, Tal I think the concentration on a single customer is probably appropriate, but I don't know that we're going to try to start breaking out the vertical inside of the vertical. Tal Liani : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Hi Jayshree, hi, Ita, hi, Anshul. So, much easier question for me. I'm just trying to kind of think about the switch product that you co-developed with Facebook and kind of the implications around that, given that at OCP, Facebook sounded like very enthusiastic about going through with implementation quickly as well as kind of, I mean, sounds like a preferred position with the customers. So can you just help me think about kind of what the implications here in terms of what you're thinking in terms of market share opportunity and kind of what does this imply in terms of your position with the other cloud providers as well? Thank you. Anshul Sadana : Samik, this is Anshul, I will that one. We've often talked about joint development without Titan customers and the announcement that OCP was a perfect example of that. The world is no longer about build versus buy. The cloud companies have too many projects to do and very few people to do those. But they do want to build and buy, and they look to the right partners to do these joint developments with. And, as you saw we do have a preferred position there. Does it, one of the examples of things we work on, we do work on similar projects or other cloud customers as well. Some of those I've never talked about publicly, but we feel very good with our position there as well. So, to the earlier comment, we do very well with these companies. So this is not to avoid mean that we are loosing design like that. I think we're doing very well technology wise. It's a matter of spent, that that did not align. But you're right. it's a great opportunity for us and I think we have the best position in the overall market to capitalize on that. Jayshree Ullal : I think this is a very exciting example of a joint collaboration which served Facebook well. But also serves all of our enterprise customers as well. We've turned around and seen a lot of activity with enterprise customers with this product. So, very good. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much like a stick with the cloud type let's go a little bit further out. I think one of the things that we have talked about as a group in prior calls is rising complexity of some of the cloud titan networks. Can you talk a little bit about, to what extent that is helping you now? Are there future sort of design topologies that are in the works that should be helpful in the future? Or conversely, is that a risk is if other rival vendors are able to use those topologies as an insertion point? That'd be helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Hi, Jeff this is Jayshree. I think one of the biggest virtues of the cloud titans is they remove the complexity and make it elegant and simple. But having said that one of the virtues or one of the challenges they have is scale and they always need the uptime and availability. So, when you look at what they've done, they've built this tremendously flat fat Leaf Spline network except there is many tiers of Leafs and many tiers of Spline for different use cases. I don't view that as complexity. I view that as removing the complexity to address many more use cases, which Arista and especially Anshul and the team done very, very well. So when you look at Spline there is regional Spline, there's DCI, there is security options, there's different types of routing use cases. And obviously they are also at the very low end different types of Leafs including integration with Facebook or Sonic in the case of Microsoft, another area of great elegance is OpenConfig and the models we develop there. So, I would say what's happened is the diversity of our use cases has, has led to many more examples of how we can work with the cloud providers. And it's not just one design, but the word complexity doesn't come to mind. The word elegance comes to mind. And Ita if you want to add some more to that. Ita Brennan : It is really the scale, right, the scale is getting larger and larger and they have to design systems to manage that, but we do very well with these customers, so we're not worried about that. Jayshree Ullal : I think it's simply that we now gone from the first innings of all of this to the second or third finally. So there's many more left, but it's no more early days. Jeff Kvaal : Well, maybe, let me rephrase it a little bit and say as these use cases grow, is there like a, should we be expecting the pace of your ability to insert into these use cases to pick up and I'm thinking particularly of routing use cases for example. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think you can expect that and you should have seen that already in the last year when we did, when we moved to 100 gigs with many of our cloud titans, we also moved tremendously fast to routing and those use cases with FlexRoute and the same thing is likely to happen as our customers move from just a 100 gig alone to a hybrid combination of 100 and 400. You can expect the familiarity in routing and the pickup to \u2013 and the qualification time to compress. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you all very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open Erik Suppiger : Yes thanks for the question. So on Microsoft, I think last year was 27%. That was up from 16, I think you had said that you thought it would probably go back to 16, the teens, by percent contribution, would you anticipate that it will still be in the mid-teen contribution in 2019. Jayshree Ullal : I don't know if we can get started without knowing the second half, but I think it's safe to say it's around there for now. It's as good an answer as the one we gave you in February. Erik Suppiger : Okay. So you haven't changed your expectation in terms of the contribution from Microsoft, is that correct? Jayshree Ullal : Based on one quarter and Q2 guide? No, we'll have to see the second half and then we'll know better. Okay. Does that make sense? Erik Suppiger : Yes. That makes sense. One quick one. Your deferred revenue came down some, was the change in the deferred revenue, was that what you would've expected as you entered the March quarter or did the deferred revenue, your recognition in deferred revenue did that change at all during the course of the quarter from your expectation? Jayshree Ullal : No, I think we knew that we had, and we talked a lot about this on the last call, right. We knew that we had some products that were waiting for customer acceptance and I think that there wasn't anything particularly unusual around that and it's also kind of very similar to what we saw on Q1 last year. So I think the impact of that is pretty much as you'd expect. Jayshree Ullal : The real big change, Eric, again, just to be completely transparent and direct was the change in demand for our products in late March and April. Erik Suppiger : All right. Very good. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks Eric. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. Even though I'd love to ask a cloud question, I'm not. So more specifically\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Thank you for sparing us. Sami Badri : Yes. Actually it has to do with your margin guidance, both on gross margin and OpEx. So if we look at sequential moves and it's interesting that your revenue guide in 2Q 2019 is coming down, which given like, I guess if they further emphasize why I'm asking this question. Should we be expecting to see your operating margins start to level off below your historical record rate that you saw in that back half of 2018, given your incoming investments to just specifically the channel? Or do you think you're going to still see a similar comparable type of operating margin profile as you've booked in the back half of 2018, in the back half of 2019, in the back of a slower channel build out? That would be great just to get an idea on how we should be modeling margins in the back half of the year? Ita Brennan : I mean, it all comes back to customer mix from a gross margin perspective, right. I mean, you're seeing an uptick in Q2 because we are seeing less cloud activity and its waiting for enterprise and for some of the others, right. And that's going to drive a higher gross margin. And obviously that would flow through to operating margin, right. So that's \u2013 it's kind of a counterbalance to some of the top line slowness that we're seeing. In terms of spending, our goal is to continue to drive sales and marketing investments that we need to make. And then we'll leverage our \u2013 we\u2019ll leverage engineering, right. And we've been investing in the engineering side of a really fast clip over the last \u2013 a number of years, I think we've had delivered the top line. So there is some room there for us to really to drive some leverage there and then use that to fund the sales and marketing. And I think that's the strategy, where that comes out exactly on operating margin, we'll have to see. I mean, you saw it tick up in the guide for Q2 off of the improved gross margin and then just with the focus that we're going to put on OpEx. Sami Badri : Got it. And then just a very quick question on Mojo, what percentage of sales were direct and what percentage of sales went through the channel? Jayshree Ullal : The Mojo business model was extremely channel. As it becomes more and more part of Arista, it would become more direct, although fulfilled by the channel still. So I would say today given our Q1 is still predominantly influenced by Mojo sales itself. It's 80% through the channel. But if I had to forecast how it will look by the end of this year, it would be probably 50/50. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try and slip in two here as well. First of all, as you kind of speak to your customers, particularly as we moved through March. I'm just curious, I know that there's a pause dynamic, but have you seen any customers kind of allude to a pause related to maybe new product cycle dynamics going into the back half of the year or is it truly just a digestion, or could we think about product cycle really being a kicker in the back half? And then with that also, I'm curious if a software only selling motion within the company, how should we think about that potentially evolving over the next couple of years? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Those are two very different but important questions. In terms of the dynamics we saw, it was pretty much \u2013 we didn't see anything different. But it was just \u2013 as we indicated, it was a pause, right. It isn't like they're waiting on new products. Most of our customers are aware of our roadmap, not just for the year but often multi-year and but they still got a business to run and so they don't pause. They always mix and match the existing products with the new products. So we know how to drive that. We're very open and transparent about the products. We're also very open and transparent about the migration. So we don't believe we saw any indication of that. However, we do feel that the excitement and enthusiasm of our new products, there's only going to help us, particularly in the campus and data center in the second half of the year. In terms of software selling, we started our CloudVision demos, I want to say 2016, right. Three years into it. It\u2019s the first time we're really seeing the excitement in our customer base. Many, many of our enterprise customers are choosing Arista because of CloudVision and EOS. As you know our products are great too, but they are just blown away by the manageability, the change control, the analytics, the automation, the macro segmentation features, the telemetry. So the software sales and not probably the software expertise in Anshul\u2019s systems engineering team driven by Ashwin couldn't be higher. He's putting a tremendous emphasis. I think we started this about a year ago. Anshul Sadana : That\u2019s right. Jayshree Ullal : And so, I think every one of our leaders as well as our systems engineer down to the customer support engineer is, I would say, a software expert first and then obviously all of the networking attributes. It's something that's been happening gradually, but particularly gratifying to see the results of it over this quarter with CloudVision have been doubled the bookings from Q1 2018. Aaron Rakers : Okay, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Thank you very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where we are on the 400-gig transition. I assume that most of the transactions, probably 90% plus this year will be driven by a 100-gig, but could you give us an update on what you're seeing between you and your competition in terms of the timing of acceptance of those products? And does that have any role in the timing of demand out of Web 2.0 cloud type? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. So, Alex, as you know we\u2019re very excited about our market leadership in 100-gig and we hope we will transform that into market leadership in 400-gig to our technology as well. We introduced the Broadcom Tomahawk products. And I'm going to turn it to Anshul to talk about some of the acceptance we've had there and we're not stopping. We got many more in the pipeline. Anshul Sadana : All right, thanks, Jayshree. Alex, the core developing with the Facebook was actually with Tomahawk 3 as well but the form factor Express was 100-gig. 400-gig is exciting to cloud companies, but as we've talked about in the past without a few 400-gig deployments in the cloud are not feasible for many architectures without the availability of ZR optics those will come to the market mid next year, most likely. So as a result of it the cloud companies would continue to deploy 100-gig that qualify the new products and over time there were transition. They're not waiting for this sudden migration to 400-gig either they don't needed or they need the optics before they can migrate to a 400-gig architecture. Jayshree Ullal : I think the key that Anshul and I are really trying to communicate is don't confuse 400-gig ready with 400-gig being deployed. So Arista is really focused on 400-gig ready architectures already we have now, but when they'll get deployed will be a continuing in time, it maybe this year, but much of it will be next year and the year beyond. Alex Henderson : So just to be clear, there are a number of product cycles around 400-gig around servers, around some other key components and most of the other companies in the \u2013 the broader macro arena that you're competing in have indicated that they expected weakness in the first half of the year from cloud. You were bucking that trend. Now, you seem to be more in line with the prior commentary from the other companies that are in the space. To the extent that they were expecting resurgence in the back half of the year, is that something that we should expect from you as well? Jayshree Ullal : I think we will refrain from what you should expect from us. We don't want to conclude that for the second half. We want to wait, watch and see, stay tuned for more. I mean I think we were very optimistic about Q2 in cloud spend as well but it didn't quite turn out that way. So before we get optimistic on Q3 and Q4, we'd want to be more sure. Anshul Sadana : Alex to complete that we are ready with the products, but as I mentioned the 400-gig transition is longer than what many of you expect and we just have to go along with that rather than\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Can't change the fact that there's no optics to connect to it. Anshul Sadana : Right. Jayshree Ullal : Right, so\u2026 Alex Henderson : Okay, I understand that. Jayshree Ullal : A 400-gig electrical only solution would be a weak solution. But Alex to answer your question, yes, I think there's a lot of promise and this is going to be a mix and match of 100 and 400-gig for a long time to come. Alex Henderson : Super. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : James? We can\u2019t hear James. Operator : James Fish, your line is open. James Fish : Can you guys hear me now? Jayshree Ullal : Yup, now we can. James Fish : Okay, great. Sorry about that. Just actually going off to the last question, it sound, I appreciate that color. Maybe you could go into what optic forms those customers are actually taking on because I know there's debate out there as to which of the two optic form factors? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : We don't debate optics. We just support all the standard form factors. Andy Bechtolsheim has been a very strong proponent of OSFP \u2013 I feel like saying PF all the time \u2013 even it\u2019s a protocol. But there's just as many customers who want QSFP-DD, Arista will support both and does support both. James Fish : Got it, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Thanks, James. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Yes, I wanted to follow-up on Alex's question. Last quarter you guys were a real exception to the digestion that other companies were seeing with the cloud. And one of the reasons, I think, you gave was that you were finding new places in the cloud to sell to. And I don't know if that meant new tiers at current customers, or new types of customers. And I'm just wondering, is that not happening, is that part of what's going on here, or did you just basically underestimate Microsoft? It was obviously a huge year last year, so a pause wouldn't be shocking at Microsoft. Jayshree Ullal : No, I think our used cases, including the regional spine and DCI live are alive and well, they're in cast and we are continuing to make great progress with many cloud titans there. I think we underestimated the customer who paused in Q2. And even the customer who paused in Q2, didn't intend to pause in Q2. So we found that \u2013 we've kind of found that out together. And when we did, they're letting you know. Steve Milunovich : So you would in a sense, didn't have the three to six months visibility that you normally would if even the customer kind of surprised themselves with this? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, in this particular case, that would be true. Ita Brennan : And I think it's important to go back and remember that we've always said we have wanted to do kind of project visibility. Order book has always been shorter, right. Jayshree Ullal : That's really good to distinguish. Ita Brennan : Yes. Jayshree Ullal : There's a big difference between orders taken and projects understood. Steve Milunovich : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : And by the way, just to add to that, there has been many times they've been positively surprised by order in the last few years and didn't forecast that either. So this is one of the rare times where the forecast came in the negative direction. Operator : Your next question comes from Henry Susanto with Gabelli. Your line is open. Henry Susanto : Good evening and thank you for taking my questions. I want to ask about the forward-looking question on the current Cloud Titan situation. How fast can a Cloud Titan resume a project that is on hold and how much lag between that and the resumption of sales of our [indiscernible] products? Jayshree Ullal : I'll take an answer to that and I'm sure Anshul can add more color. I think they can resume a product as fast as they put it on hold. They can put things on hold in weeks and they can resume it in weeks to months. Is that correct? Anshul Sadana : Yes, Henry look as I said, the cloud customers\u2019 CapEx spending does not correlate with us in a quarter-by-quarter basis. There's many things to spend money on including building data centers, find service, and so on. But in the end, in the long run, if they are adding racks and they're adding data centers across the region and their appearing, then they will need our products. So it's fairly easy for them to turn it back on as well. Simply a matter of when the rate of spend money on these projects. Henry Susanto : Good for you. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thank you. Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open. John Marchetti : Thanks very much. I think I may get in the last question here tonight. Just wanted to follow-up Jayshree you talked a little bit about the second half recovery or certainly the hopes for that in the second half. A big piece of that obviously being some of the new products that you tend to launch there. How much of this, I guess what's new, should we expect maybe to be focused on the cloud? Is it much broader than that? Just trying to get a sense of maybe the outlook for the second half, how much that relies on some of these new products versus maybe just some of the demand coming back a little bit for you? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, thanks John. We saved the best for last as a question I guess. I think we've always been an engineering company. We're very proud of our R&D and new products fuel our customers to enhance their networks while existing parent of products also carry the way for us in specific use cases. So I think the new products, especially in the campus will definitely help, but new products in the data center and cloud will be a continuation and a continuum of what we've always done. So I think if there's any uptick in the second half that we didn't project yet, it would come more from new products in the campus, whereas new products from the datacenter and in the cloud have already been factored in. John Marchetti : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, John. Charles Yager : Okay. Thank you all for your questions. This concludes the Arista Q1 2019 earnings call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Elliott, Director of Business and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Chuck Elliott : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2019. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions, and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. Our profitability growth combination was once again demonstrated with a non-GAAP revenue of $608.3 million, while non-GAAP earnings per share grew to a record $2.44. Services contributed 15.6% of revenue. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.7% influenced by our solid performance from our enterprise vertical. We registered record number of new customers in calendar Q2 and continue to drive new customer logo expansion at the rate of one to two per day throughout the quarter. In terms of verticals, the cloud titan segment remained our largest vertical. The modern enterprise high-tech segment is now consistently becoming our second largest with financials in third place, Tier 2 specialty cloud providers and service provider, coming in at fourth and fifth place. In terms of geography mix, in Q2, 2019, the international contribution was 27%, while the Americas were at 73%. We had a band a quarter for new products in Q2 2019. We launched two 400 Gigabit product families during Q2 with the Arista R3 Series for modular 7,500 and 7,280 models, as well as a brand new Arista 7,800 chassis family for 400 gig switching and routing based on the Broadcom Jericho2 silicon. This is enabling our flagship EOS and uncompromising multi terabit capacity and availability. We have now launched 10, 400 gig platforms, and Arista has more 400 gig products than any other peer. We have begun active product qualification with more meaningful 400 gig revenue really expected next year in 2020. Given the recent industry news, I wanted to take this opportunity to comment on 400 gig optics. So to join me on this is Andy Bechtolsheim, our Chief Development Officer, and Chairman, who will speak more about this. Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim : Thanks, Jayshree. The first observation on optics, is that in the cloud, particle optics have led to the disaggregated business model between the switch and the optics vendors with virtually all optics in the cloud being purchased directly from optics vendors. Cloud providers typically qualify at least three optics vendors to ensure lowest cost and diversity of supply and we don't see that changing with 400 gig. In the case of 400 gig CR, which is the long distance optics that one ship in volume until mid 2020, we are aware of one dozen optics module vendors that plan to offer compatible 400 gig CR modules competing on the basis of price, quality and volume availability. We do believe that 400 gig CR will be a very competitive market with competition that will drive unprecedented price performance improvements for 400 gig coherent optics. We work closely with our largest customers to qualify all 400 gig optics including 400 gig CR that are relevant to them with the objective to deliver the most cost effective 400 gig optic solutions to the market. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Andy. So speaking of new products, we also introduced Arista's first entry into the cognitive campus edge with our 720XP Power over Ethernet switches and our new WiFi6 offerings, all of which are supporting CloudVision for the campus, flow based telemetry and security segmentation services. With this Arista establishes an exciting and formal complete cognitive portfolio addressing the transitional changes in the campus security and IoT era. We are in early field trials now and we expect more results in the second half 2019. So speaking of second half 2019, as you all know, we experienced some turbulence in Q2, 2019 with the pause of a specific cloud titan set of orders. They have now resumed spending, and we expect stabilization in second half 2019 for the overall cloud titan spent. Certainly, second half will be an improvement over the first half, but we do not expect the cloud momentum to be a repeat of second half 2018. Naturally, these trends are consistent with the annual cloud CapEx forecast reported in recent weeks. Our enterprise segment is healthy with growing interest in our campus and multi-cloud migrations. On June 6, 2019, we celebrated our five year IPO anniversary at the New York Stock Exchange with both our premier customers and analysts. Our deep collaboration with Microsoft was evidenced with CEO, Satya Nadella joining me at our special event as our chief guest. Together, the two companies share a synergistic vision in cloud area networking. We announced Microsoft Azure cloud integration including V WAN and IoT Center. As our customers migrate to a cloud-led strategy, bringing holistic client to any cloud experience, we are seeing a compelling conviction in Arista as their strategic partner. I am proud to share that for the fifth consecutive year, we have also attained a status as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Center networking, with our strongest showing yet in both vision and ability to execute. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for more financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 2019 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $608.3 million, up 17% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance of $600 million to $610 million. Service revenues remained strong, representing approximately 15.6% of revenue, up from 15.1% last quarter, reflecting a healthy level of renewals activity. International revenues for the quarter came in at a $162 million or 27% of total revenue, up from 26% in the prior period. Overall gross margin in Q2 was 64.7% above the midpoint of our guidance of 64% to 65% and up from 64.5% last quarter. Gross margin in the period benefited from a lower cloud contribution combined with healthy enterprise and services performance. Operating expenses for the quarter were $158.7 million or 26.1% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter at $160.7 million. R&D spending came in at $101.7 million or 16.7% of revenue, down from $106.5 million last quarter. This reflected lower levels of new product related NRE and prototype spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $45.1 million or 7.4% of revenue, up from last quarter with increased headcount, somewhat offset by some reductions in other sales costs. Our G&A costs were $11.9 million or 2% of revenue, up slightly from last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $235.1 million or 38.7% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $13.8 million and our effective tax rate was lower at approximately 20%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $198.6 million or 32.7% of revenue. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 81.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.44, up 26.4% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.3 billion. We repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter at a weighted average price of $246 per share. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a three-year $1 billion stock repurchase program commencing in Q2 2019. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically and will be funded from operating cash flows. We generated $196 million of cash from operations in the second quarter, reflecting strong net income performance, offset by increased working capital requirements and a reduction in deferred revenue. DSOs came in at 51 days, up from 41 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2.4 times, down slightly from 2.5 last quarter. Inventory decreased to $314.2 million in the quarter, down from $347.2 million in the prior period. Our total deferred revenue balance of $502.2 million, down from $536.5 million in Q1. Our product deferred revenue balance decreased by approximately $38 million in the quarter, reflecting customer acceptance of new features. Accounts payable days were 37 days, down from 38 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.4 million. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. As expected, we experienced some softness in demand from our cloud customers in the second quarter. While early indications are for improved demand from these customers in the September period, we believe that second-half growth in this business will remain somewhat muted as compared to prior years. We expect our enterprise and financial verticals to continue to perform well, offset by some declines in the service provider business. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix being the key driver. We will continue to manage investments in the business carefully, prioritizing growth in sales headcount and resources, as we look to expand our market coverage. With this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows. Revenues of approximately $647 million to $657 million, gross margins of approximately 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 36%, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5%, with diluted shares of approximately $81.9 million. I will now turn the call back to Chuck. Chuck? Chuck Elliott : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Thank you. Jayshree, on the campus side, can you provide any metrics, customer winds, anything that is worth investment you -- investor community knowing about, in terms of tracking your progress there. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jason. As you know, we introduced the products in June at the end of the day in June 6, and we said most of them would be available in Q3. So, it's a little early to be giving customer winds, but I can say with confidence that we are in very many early field trials with customers to the tune of 10s of them, and Anshul and the team have been having very, very good interactions, and I fully expect that we'll have more results in Q3, Q4, and certainly much of next year. Jason Ader : And how do you respond to somebody that says, okay, you guys have done well on the enterprise side with data center switching, but the campus side is a much more complex sale from the standpoint of typically channels or -- channels are involved. A lot is wireless, there's potentially security. This is a lot more going on with the campus, a major campus deployment. How do you help people get comfortable that you guys will be able to replicate some of the success you've had on the data center side? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. So step back for a moment and ask when did we get our success in the data center with enterprise. It was five years after we started shipping products. We didn't even report much on the data center. We mostly focused on the niche of financials and the cloud in the early years, right? So I'm pretty sure we won't take five years to enter the campus market, but I'm here to say that the traction with enterprise really come in three categories, the early adopters, who already love our EOS, and therefore, that's going to be the fastest place of attraction. The CloudVision, don't underestimate that, where they're looking for that single point of management and single pane of glass, and then to your point, the third one will be new channels, new partners, new systems integrators. So, if you look at those three segments, we can start playing in two out of the three already. And so my response would be that the campus technology in many ways is no different than the data center. It's very similar in Layer-2, Layer-3 protocols, and customers who have appreciated us for the last five years with EOS and CloudVision are the first points of success for us. The second point of success, which is new customers and new logos will take longer, and -- but campus for us is a multi-year journey, and as I said many times before, I'd be very happy if we did, our first year was $100 million, because I think it sows the right seeds for $0.5 billion and $1 billion in the future, but none of us should think this is an overnight one quarter journey, this is a three to five year journey. Jason Ader : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. James Fish : Hi. Congrats on the quarter. Just one for me is Ita. How should we think about the impact of the 25% tariff on the gross margin guide? Obviously you're reiterating to 63% to 65%. But if we were to get a trade deal tomorrow, I guess, how much would gross margins be positively impacted? And or have you done enough to kind of offset it from a supply chain perspective. Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean, I think we've been working on improving the supply chain and addressing some of the issues with the supply chain and at the same time, obviously, we've had an adder to customers, which we've also been managing, and as the tariff rates have changed, we've been fortunate enough we've made enough progress that we've been able to kind of hold or marginally increase that customer adder. And I think with the new news that we heard just before the call, I think that's still the case. Right. We believe that we've done enough from a supply chain perspective that we should have minimal impact. But I wouldn't think that there is a big swing in gross margin, one way or the other, if either it went away completely tomorrow or we continue to see some changes in it. I think we've done enough work where it's kind of mostly neutral from a gross margin P&L perspective. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, James. Just to add to that, with a 63% to 65% range, we think the tariff can have impact on the gross margin, but it will be within that range of 63% to 65%, and as Ita said, the manufacturing team has done the tremendous amount of work. We are not immune to the tariffs. We absolutely are affected by it. And, but I think the effect will be minimal. James Fish : Yeah. Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yeah, hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess, I'd just ask you, you had said that the large cloud titan orders had dropped to almost zero in the middle of March. And you didn't really have good visibility on when those might return. It seems like they resumed spending per your comments. When would you expect spending there to be back to normal, or is there some new level normal? Can you just give us some kind of an idea of what sort of visibility you have? And how you see that progressing over the next few quarters? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think, first of all, Rod. The new level of norm has changed. We shouldn't use 2017 and 2018 as our frame of reference, right? So, first half was a real adjustment for us to the norm in 2017 and 2018. Having said that, I think we \u2013 you've all seen the CapEx reports and depending on whose CapEx you're talking about, they have all gone from double-digit growth to single-digit and some of them are negative. So you can expect that the new norm is no more double-digit growth and it's going to hover in the low single digits. Anshul, would you like to add some more to that. Anshul Sadana : Sure. We mentioned this last time, but I want to reiterate, which is there was no design loss. The cloud titan has un-paused, or they're back to normal spending that they do and the allocations were unchanged. Which is why \u2013 Rod Hall : Is this the reason -- that you guys had called out? Jayshree Ullal : Sorry, can you repeat the question, Rod? Rod Hall : You guys, just to clarify Jayshree, you guys had said there is an inventory and they were using inventory last quarter. I just wondered where we are in the process of them utilizing that inventory. Is it all done or they're still utilizing out of inventory as well? Jayshree Ullal : I don't think we made an explicit comment that they had extraordinary inventory levels. It's difficult to have some. The real reason for our Q2 turbulence was a very conscious decision on the part of a specific cloud titan to put orders on pause, and those have resumed. And they've resumed at levels that are improved over the first half, but nowhere close to the second half of 2018. So \u2013 Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : Inventory was not the reason. Rod Hall : Right, got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, congrats ladies, and Andy, and Anshul, I guess so everyone. Great quarter. Jayshree Ullal : Well, there is a broader definition of ladies now. Ittai Kidron : Yes, that is true. I guess, I do want to kind of drill down again on the cloud. I just want to make sure I understand that you claim stabilization. I guess, I'm kind of wondering, has there been a change in the way they communicate with you? Because it was a surprise last quarter. I guess, what makes you comfortable that they're not going to surprise you here, and I know anything can happen, but has there been a change in the way you communicate with them such that gives you confidence that there is a stabilization? Jayshree Ullal : Ittai, that's a good question. I'm not trying to imply that they couldn't make further changes on their business side, right? What I am trying to say and again Anshul can clarify is, we're literally taking this one quarter at a time. And at this point, we see stabilization in Q3. And anything can change in Q4, but if we had to predict, I think with the stabilization in Q3 could carry on to Q4, that's what they're saying, who knows what's going to happen in 2020, your guess is as good as mine, but maybe Anshul knows better, you want to add something. Anshul Sadana : But I don't know anything about the future. Jayshree Ullal : Good one. Anshul Sadana : The Q2 communication was sudden, but it was a very rare event for them. And otherwise, our communication has been very normal back and forth that you expect between our customer and us and the engineering collaboration as well as planning for next gen designs. So, nothing really extraordinary there, everything is very, very normal now. Ittai Kidron : Very good, and Ita, just so you don't feel lonely here. A question on the OpEx, at the midpoint of your guide, there is quite a significant increase quarter-over-quarter and expenses, help me, I know, you probably want to be some conservatism built in there, but nonetheless, is there an unusual level of prototyping that's happening every quarter? Help me get my hands around, how would I explain out about a $20 million to $24 million quarter-over-quarter increase in OpEx, which is something that you've never really done? Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean, I think there is definitely some reserving the right to make some investments If you want to included in there, and then I think the rest of it is we did push hard on R&D, we talked about them in the last call that we would prioritize sales and marketing and maybe, push a little bit harder in R&D, just given the quarter that we were heading into, and obviously the intention is to kind of not to continue to do that. So you will see some increase in R&D as we move through this next quarter. Ittai Kidron : Great. Best of luck. Jayshree Ullal : Our R&D cycles, Ittai, with new product, right. So we can always time it and we've got so much new product coming out of our years is one of the things we're very proud of and that has a natural impact on prototype expense. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Good stuff. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yeah, thanks. Can you guys hear me okay? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Alex Kurtz : All right. Just a clarification and a question. So, Jayshree on your comments about the large cloud titan and the resumption in the second half, do you see them changing how they use their networks and like the capacity in the utilization and quote unquote how hot they run their networks? Because that one cloud titan obviously is chasing other cloud titan for business and I think the underlying investor assumption is they'll continue to invest to compete. And so I'm just try to understand, do you think given all the understanding of their network that you have, are they making a pivot and how they run their network? Jayshree Ullal : Again, Alex, I'll comment, and Anshul's closer to it. So he can give more detail. We have not seen any appreciable changes on gosh, I'm going to optimize for the last megabit of bandwidth or anything like that. There has been a general increase in spend due to the 100 gigabit common denominator across all layers of the Leaf-Spine network, including the data center interconnect that will vary on 400 gig. Some cloud titans may stay on 100 gig longer, some may go to 400 gig faster, some actually pick 200 gig. So we do see the sort of the personality performance changes, but we don't see any major bandwidth planning down to the megabit at all. One thing I'll add and Anshul can comment to that, is one thing we also see is, I've always said, we're in the early innings, but that counts on the fact that the cloud titan is going to continue to invest in new regions and new locations for data centers. More than your performance bandwidth, I expect, we will see more planning around where they put their data centers, and some of them may not open new data centers and some may rely on a more incremental strategy. Anshul Sadana : Yes. Alex, most of the commentary in the industry right now about optimizations so I believe is tied more to compiler computer virtualization optimizations. As you know the networking spend on switches and routers, it is in the range of 6% to 7% of their total CapEx. So they're not going to try and squeeze that and create a bottleneck, which impacts the remaining 93%. So the network has to run error free and no one is trying to try and optimize beyond what we have managed to do by providing a very competitive offering. Alex Kurtz : Thank you, Anshul. Then Ita, on the maintenance support number, it looked like it missed the consensus estimates by a pretty wide margin. You obviously did well on product, was there something that's -- there was some mix on the balance sheet as far as deferred or that we should understand as far as why there was a disconnect there, anything that we should be aware of contextually around the maintenance and support execution in the quarter? Ita Brennan : No, I mean, I think if you look at the percentage of revenue, it's pretty consistent, right, quarter-over-quarter. You're talking about the services revenue on the\u2026 Alex Kurtz : Yes. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I don't think there is anything unusual there. We don't guide it specifically. Right? Alex Kurtz : Yes, I know. Jayshree Ullal : I mean, it tends to be high in Q1 or Q4, because this is very normal -- yes, this is very normal, Alex. Ita Brennan : Percentage of revenue, it wasn't that different. So I'll go back and look at the consensus numbers, but I think it's not a number we guide and I don't think the quarter-over-quarter trend looked particularly different to what we would have expected. Alex Kurtz : Okay, just checking. Thank you very much. Ita Brennan : Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Aaron? Aaron Rakers : Yes. Can you hear me? Jayshree Ullal : Now we can, you're a bit choppy. Go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. I apologize for that. So congratulations again on the quarter. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Aaron Rakers : My question is actually on the enterprise -- the traditional enterprise market. There's clearly been some recent signals of a lot of choppiness. One of the enterprise system companies pre-announced tonight. We saw Intel's chopping results, et cetera. I'm curious of how you, what you've been seeing in that market? And what gives you confidence that that market will continue to grow at what sounds to be a very healthy pace through the back half of the calendar year? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think the enterprise is a small -- we are new to this market, right? And we are a recent entrant, so we're not operating of the large base where we are a market leader or anything we're the newcomer. So because we have a large TAM, and because we have highly differentiated products. And I think also because there is an awful lot of enterprise fatigue with existing dominance of one vendor and lack of quality and all of that. We are seeing a unique situation, despite the macro. Now not to say if there is a really bad macro we wouldn't see it, but I think despite the macro, we're enjoying a little oasis in the desert, if you will. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, a question and a clarification, I guess, for me, please. On the question, I'm wondering if you all have applied the same methodology to coming up with your guidance, as you have in prior quarters. It is sometimes tempting to adopt a more conservative assumption on close rates or what have you after a guide down? And then secondly, the clarification is when you say back to sustainable levels in 3Q, Jayshree were you meaning over the course of the third quarter we'll be back at sustainable levels or we're at full run rate August 1, game on? Jayshree Ullal : So both your questions are intriguing. I'm still kind of processing them. So the first one is, did we guide like we normally do and were we been conservative. I'm just translating your question, is that what you asked? Jeff Kvaal : Yes, yes. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So I think this word conservative in the label we have is a little bit of a misnomer. I think we're guiding as best as we can, and there is very little sandbagging going on. Particularly, of course, we have customer concentration, but particularly with the enterprise, there is so many more customers and so much more to forecast, we do our best in analyzing that forecast and this is our best effort. I wouldn't think there's a lot of buffer in that. That would be my question to you, Jeff. And in terms of as a game on August or is it going to happen through the quarter? It's very difficult to ever predict a quarter, especially in it's weakest slowest summer months in some parts of the world, so I wouldn't say it's game on in August. I would say it's going to be a process through which, we will need all three months of the quarter to execute on this one. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you. Thank you all. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Your line is open. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I wonder if you can comment on what you expect your largest customer to be as a percentage of sales in 2019. Jayshree, I think earlier in the year, you had indicated it would go back to historical levels, which many of us interpreted as 16% of sales instead of the 27% in 2018. But as we get closer to the end of the year, you must have better visibility. So I'm curious to hear that. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. That's a good question. I think my prediction of teens, mid to high-teens is still what I think is our best estimate, 27% was wonderful, but a rare event, yeah. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. And then a follow-up on 400 gig. I know you generally said you expect that in 2020, but early part, latter part and then can you parse how you're thinking about 400 gig between cloud routing and cloud switching? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Good question. Well, 400 gig, as you can tell from Andy and my talk, we are ready with the products. No problem with that, but we have been often slowed down by the optics. And as Andy said, I think he is predicting some of the optics to be in 2020. You want to comment on that, Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim : Yeah, one of the most important use cases for 400 gig is actually the 400 gig CR data center interconnect and those optics will not be in volume production until mid 2020. But we do expect customers to qualify these optics way before that. So we cannot predict the exact timing here, but it's going to be in 2020. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. And as of switching versus routing, because a large number of these use cases will be data center interconnect, it will be both. It will be hard to parse one versus the other. They'll almost always want an option for routing or start right with routing in the beginning. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Tejas. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you. I want to follow-up on that 400 gig question. Just I understand in terms of the availability of optics, but can you help us understand what the -- what stage of evaluation of your equipment customers are in or potential customers are in? And can they fully evaluate and qualify the products without the availability of those, commercial availability of those optics? Andy Bechtolsheim : Sure. James, the way to look at this is many of the new products 400 gig are based on Jericho2 or Tomahawk 3 or other silicon, and the many-form factors with 100-gig ports as well. So customers are busy qualifying them as 100-gig switches and routers first. They use them in existing designs, but with more efficiency with these new products. And then they'll wait for optics like the ZR optics or DR or FR optics to show in volume before they can really use them as 400-gig. But the transition has already starting in qualification, but again, you can expect 100-gig closed, and I think from a material impact on revenue in the industry, I would think of the second half 2020. James Faucette : Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Jayshree, you talked about your go-to-market on enterprise. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about today your needs for sales and support around those new products. Is that something that you feel like you'll need to ramp up personnel ahead of sales or can you continue to be really efficient bringing on headcount to support those customers kind of after commitments are already made? Jayshree Ullal : Actually, that's a very good question. I think we will ramp up sales people ahead of sales. But we can ramp the systems engineers and some of the support engineers post sales after we get the wind. So, a little bit of both. So we are not applying the same discipline and conservatism, James that you saw us do in the data center. We are definitely adding headcount, and if you look at our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue, it has increased, maybe not appreciably, because we are still holding the bar pretty high. And making sure that the caliber and quality is not compromised just because we want to higher a bunch of people. The other big thing, I think that's going to play a huge part in this is partners. We've never been viewed as a partner friendly company, but we are very friendly with partners at the moment. And I think the campus is a key piece of that strategy and the partner see us as a key piece of that. So, the two will go hand-in-hand. James Faucette : All right. That's good. You shouldn't have any problem being friendly with people. So, good luck. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Before I ask my questions. I'd just like to ask you to talk faster in the next call. Jayshree Ullal : I can do Paul. Paul Silverstein : I've got a handful of questions if I may. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, Paul. She's trying to go from 100-gigabit to 400-gigabit speed. Paul Silverstein : Yeah. She is doing a good job of it. Most of these questions are clarifications, but let me fire away first off, regionally, what are you seeing with respect to the quality of in-demand on a regional basis. I appreciate that good chunky revenue comes from cloud. So, perhaps the regional concept doesn't quite apply. But to the extent you have regional exposure; it looks like your non-U.S. and your U.S. were about the same growth rate of the high teens. What are you seeing regionally? And then I've got some follow-ups. Jayshree Ullal : The growth rate is very good, especially in enterprise customers across all regions. We're seeing better growth rate in terms of new customer acquisition in the international regions. So, the big bet in larger customers tend to be more U.S.-driven and the new customer logos tend to be more international-driven, but all regions are growing nicely. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, and again I appreciate that you guys are sure gainers or so, you're less economically, less macro-sensitive, but to an extent you are sensitive like any other company to a degree to macro trends in terms of the quality of budgets, quality of spends, any thoughts on what you're seeing. We've seen from a number of other companies, most recently NetApp today in terms of weakness from an in-demand perspective, any thoughts on that? Once again, I appreciate that you're sure gainers or so, maybe you don't see it the same way or any thoughts you can share with us? Jayshree Ullal : My experience with macro issues is we certainly won't be immune. But the way we will see it is that a lot of the activity we are seeing may not result in fast decisions. So, probably prolong decision making would be my biggest worry should a macro set in, because usually when a macro sets in, customers tend to get conservative and then they don't want to make new decisions. Paul Silverstein : Have you seen that elongation yet? Is that just a concern at this point or you're already seeing? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I'm addressing a theoretical concern. We have not seen it yet. Paul Silverstein : All right. And then on service revenues, does it go without saying that the growth in your service revenue is going to slow consistent with the moderation growth and new product revenue? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think there is a linearity associated with that. Ita Brennan : Yes, I mean you'll get some offset just from renewals and stuff, but overall, it will trend as the product. Paul Silverstein : All right. Two more clarifications. Jayshree on your comment or your reiteration I think from the June Analyst event on the $100 million forecast for enterprise campus, my sense is that that's drifted out a little bit from a timing perspective, when you're talking $100 million is that a calendar 2020 outlook or is that the departure point September, I recognize we're not talking about a ton a time in terms of the difference Jayshree Ullal : Yes, exactly Paul. Paul Silverstein : But when you said $100 million, what period of time. Jayshree Ullal : No, what I said at the Analyst Day, which was only six weeks ago still holds, which is four quarter starting from Q3. So Q3 -- second half of 2019 and first half of 2020 unless something changes substantially, but we're still bullish on that and optimistic that we have the activity to result in that number. Got it. Paul Silverstein : Got it. Ita going back to the OpEx question which was asked earlier. I would have thought your answer would have been as simple as enterprise costs more money. One of the beautiful things about cloud, not just the concentration spin, but it was a relatively inexpensive market to address, enterprise has got a bulk of your salesforce, your channel, and that cost money. Not that you're projecting a dramatic increase, but correct me if I'm wrong, you're projecting an increase from 7.5% to 10% on sales and marketing with operating margin going down to 35%. Are those still the operative numbers going forward and is that what's going on in terms of the increase in spend? Ita Brennan : Yes, I mean I think quarter-over-quarter; it's above the things in there like we talked about R&D and stuff, just from the quarterly trend. I think over the longer term when you think about the model, I think that's what we described at the Analyst Day and that's the right way to think about it. But again we're not going to get 10% overnight. I mean we're growing. And then we're adding incrementally as a percentage of revenue, but it's not, it's not, it won't become 10% overnight. But that is the model, think about that number. Jayshree Ullal : Paul, can we do that in the call back. Paul Silverstein : Absolutely, no worries. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : I'm sure, I'm going to ask the question, Paul was going to ask. So, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the market share trajectory. So, there are two or three variables that were always the kind of underpinnings of the company story. One was the cloud growth obviously that slowed quite a bit. The other one was the ability to gains considerable amount of share annually, your share is fairly low. Can you talk about excluding cloud, what's your expectation for the overall market growth for switching to be, and whether you can continue to pick up a point to two or three on market share annually? And a follow-up on that question is, does there any change in that as we go into the 400-gig. I think you've been pretty clear that you think you will continue to grow based on your software advantages 400-gig, could you address those two together? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Sure Alex. It's always difficult to predict market share, but I don't think anything has substantially changed on total available market. Yes, the cloud spend has reduced. So, we may see some shifting of TAM between one quarter and another, and I think our position, both in the cloud, and in our rate of enterprise design winds is only getting stronger. So, from a market share gain, since we've gone from zero to the teens rather quickly, probably a rate of gain -- rate of gain will be slower, maybe more like one to two rather than two to three on an annual basis, but I believe we will continue to be a share gain, both in overall high performance switching and especially in 100-gigabit Ethernet switching. Alex Henderson : Great. If I could throw one more question in. The Luxtera and our Acacia acquisitions over at Cisco, if Andy is still around. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Andy is here. Alex Henderson : Any thoughts on why he did that -- they did that and how that might affect you? And is there any concerns that as optics need to get closer to the switch chip that they may be positioning to have an advantage as we get to the 53 terabits switch chips that require the chips to but up against the optics, can you give us any thoughts on where they're going with that? Thanks. Andy Bechtolsheim : Great. So we, obviously, don't want to speculate on a competitor's motivations or actions here. But what I will say is that the optics field is intensely competitive. There's plenty of suppliers, both with silicon photonics, technology, the 400 gig DSPs that you need for the CR that we don't see the competitive environment of optics changing at all, and the pluggable form factor in particular has just taken over the market over the last 10, 20 years, and we don't see that changing for all kinds of reasons. And in particular, your question on 51.2, our plan is to deliver that product with conventional pluggable optics, which are well-understood and will be the time-to-market product. I mean, we do understand that certain people excited about core packaging, but there is so many problems with co-packaged optics, I don't even know where to start. So I'll leave it at that. Alex Henderson : Okay. Thank you very much for your answers. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. It was great to hear Andy on the call at the beginning as well as pretty recently, but Arista does a lot of things very much on purpose. So having Andy on the call as well as addressing the 400 gig topic. Can you help us just maybe understand a little bit better, are you trying to like clarify some misperceptions or show that Arista is likely to gain more share? Or, there was a definitely a temple change to the speaking at the beginning of this call versus previously with Andy, and I appreciate, I\u2019m just trying to figure out why and the excitement behind it as far as competitive standpoint or share or figure out that the change in tone. Thank you. Andy Bechtolsheim : Yeah, Jim, if you look at the analyst forecasts for 400 gig, like the lower forecast, in particular. The mix showed projections on where 400 gig will actually deployed. The vast amount of 400 gig forecast is in cloud, obviously, cloud, large cloud and small cloud. So given our strong footprint in that market, we are very, I shouldn't say optimistic, but confident that we will have a good share of that business going forward. 400 gig as a technology is actually almost overkill for traditional enterprise. I don't think you're going to see much 400 gig adoption in the enterprise anytime soon. So this is a very much a cloud story, and it's really when the cloud customers, the large cloud customers are starting to deploy this when you see the big ramp, and we do expect that in 2020. Jayshree Ullal : And we have Andy frequently as a guest speaker. I don't think there's any deliberate intent to do it differently than any other quarterly call except investors love hearing from Andy and we love Andy, and I think sometimes the 400 gig gets overhyped, and I think bringing a dose of realism that Arista, the market leader in high performance switching and especially 100 gig has more products than anyone else in 400 gig and is ready for that transition, but it will take time is a pragmatic message. Jim Suva : Great. Thanks so much for the detail Jayshree, Andy. That's all my questions. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up on the 400 gig theme, understanding the cloud will be the primary adopter. I'd like to hear your thoughts on maybe compare and contrast, the 400 gig cycle versus the 100 gig cycle for you. Reflecting on time, and I guess where I'm coming from is you're now the incumbent with 100 gig, you're sort of the one everybody wants to be. So it's a different position, you're not the underdog anymore. So I want to get that perspective. And just as a clarification within this context, my impression is that right now the 400 gig switches are being deployed as just really, really good 100 gig, high density 100 gig. So not necessarily awaiting the optics, and I just want to make sure that understanding is correct? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I'm going to kick it off, and I'd love Anshul and Andy's detail on it as well. When I step back and look at 10-gig migration, it took about eight years to happen, and why did it take so long. There\u2019s a very long tail, because 1-gig was good enough and the compute and storage wasn't fast enough or large enough to require any better IO and the cloud hadn't happened. The advent of cloud really pushed 25-gig, 40-gig, 50-gig and especially 100-gig. So the 100-gig cycle instead of taking eight years, only took two or three years. And this is why we became such a market leader so quickly. It all happened between 2016 and 2019. When I look at 400-gig, I think you'll have to look at it as split it between the 10-gig cycle and the 100-gig cycle. It will likely take three to four years to happen, it will start first in the cloud. And then it'll migrate over time to other high-tech enterprise and cloud specialty providers as well. So hopefully that gives you a sense of why 10-gig took too long, 100-gig happened very fast and 400-gig maybe somewhere in the middle. Andy Bechtolsheim : If I could add to that. So the 100-gig is still ramping as you may know. Jayshree Ullal : Exactly. Andy Bechtolsheim : So we\u2019re expecting very significant growth into next year, and maybe even to 2021 on 100 gig ports, no mistake about that. The reason why cloud company would deploy 400 gig is because it's more cost effective than 100 gig on a per-bit basis, right. And as you know, the -- our 400 gig products save typically double the cost performance for 400 gig than 100 gig. However, the optics, they are not at that level. Right? So because the optics are still too expensive and arguably just not available in volume, a cloud company, if they wanted to could not deploy 400 gig to the volume. It's just not possible. And keep in mind, 100 gig is deploying in the cloud at the rate of, call it 10 million ports a year, and it takes a long time to get to those kind of volumes on the optics. So this is why we've been saying all along that it's a 2020 story and even get to meaningful revenue in 400 gig. Go ahead Anshul, sorry. Anshul Sadana : This is important for everyone to understand that when we came out with 100 gig products in 2016 with a $7500, our competition had already announced their 100 gig products. So it wasn't as if we had some huge advantage and we were the only one with the product and so on. The market was very competitive, but you win on your own merit, on software, on partnership with the customer, on solving real world problems, on quality, on support, and so on. And the exact same thing will repeat here, and we feel very good about our position and you've seen the kind of collaboration we've done with companies like Microsoft and Facebook recently, and I believe that will continue. Simon Leopold : And is competition or the competitiveness, the price pressure any different in this cycle because your competitors are saying that they're going to take market share and 400 gig. Should we think this is any different than 100 gig? Anshul Sadana : No, we've always competed against tough competitors. That will continue. I don't believe there's any different in dynamics so far. Jayshree Ullal : I mean, we're not seeing new competition. So it's the same competitors being aggressive. Simon Leopold : Great, thank you for taking my questions. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask at a higher level Jayshree, how are you thinking about kind of given the sluggishness in the cloud spend that you are seeing how thinking about diversification in the customer mix, and particularly if you have any views of strategically where you want the customer to mix to be kind of five years from now, is there more of an effort to kind of steer the business toward the particular customer mix to kind of mitigate some of the volatility around the cloud? And just a quick follow-up for Ita, maybe you addressed this, there is some headline today about incremental tariffs on products that were exempt earlier. Can you just clarify if there are any products that you're shipping from China that were exempt earlier? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Samik, I think this is a good question. Our sales and go-to-market strategy is really shaping to be one that was on focused verticals to a horizontal enterprise where we will be much broader from a coverage, from a geography, and from addressing a broader enterprise perspective. And I think this will provide important diversification. Campus was an important piece of that diversification. Two years ago, we asked our customers should we be in the campus and they said no. And then this year when we asked them they said you're late. So that tells you the thirst and the hunger for Arista technology to go beyond the data centers. So addressing a broader TAM and going out of our normal comfort verticals into a horizontal go-to-market is an important piece of this. And Ita you were going to answer the tariff question? Ita Brennan : Yes, I think the way to think about it is, yes, we will have some impact, but between kind of the improvements we're making on the supply chain and other stuff, I think from a financial perspective, it's kind of balances out, right. So it's a pretty minimal impact from a financial perspective, even though we're continuing to churn the supply chain to respond. Samik Chatterjee : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves : Hi, just a quick question from me, you guys have talked about the annual numbers in terms of like the street estimates. So I just wanted clarity there, are you guys comfortable where street estimates are at this point? Just to get an idea for kind of what seasonality in the back half looks like. Jayshree Ullal : No, I think you guys have been more aggressive than we have in our guidance. We're going one quarter at a time, but you all started the year at 30%, and we at Analyst Day, as you know Ita guided to a mid to high teens depending on the cloud spend, right, so. Ita Brennan : Yes, I think, Mitch, the manner is that we're taking this a quarter at a time from our perspective. It's difficult for us to go beyond that at this stage. Just kind of running the business a quarter at a time. Mitch Steves : Got it. And then just to clarify on the Q4 kind of expectations. So I'm trying to just to understand the half on half commentary is, how -- is it going to be essentially a few points below seasonal trends or do you think that it's going be more than that? Ita Brennan : Yes, I mean I think the comments were kind of clear that we think second half over second half, it's a very different environment. Right? I mean if you think about where we were at the second half last year, there was very strong demand, we're building deferred, etc. I think it's significantly different when you look at where we are and in the second half of this year. I think that's what we're trying to communicate. To put a specific number on it? We're not ready to do that for Q4 yet, but I think there has been significant changes in the momentum and the growth in the cloud, part of the business. Mitch Steves : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli Research. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto : Good evening and thank you for taking my one and only question. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Hendi. Thank you for following the rules. Hendi Susanto : Hi, Jayshree, your cognitive campus will have general availability in Q3 2019. Do you have updates and would you be able to share goals, timing, and milestone in terms of early trials, early adopters, in terms of verticals, integration with Mojo, and building an ecosystem of channel partners? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, I think we'll have more updates and results toward the latter half of 2019. In terms of activity, it's been very high. We've integrated Mojo into the company, that's been a year now. We've integrated it into our CloudVision. The combination of our 720XP-P or E-Switch in Mojo is really redefining a new cognitive campus layer. The X3 Splines have been very well received. So what you're seeing here is Arista is having to position the new architectural shift to the next-generation campus in terms of network design, and have the products tested at the same time. So the activity level is very, very high. The results will definitely share more with you in Q3 and Q4. Hendi Susanto : Thank you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Hendi. Operator : Your last question comes from Brian Young with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Young : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I also had a question on the campus opportunity. So I've been hearing more and more of that new enterprise campus deals are often led by discussions around WiFi solutions. Is that what you're seeing as well? And if so is your \u2013 I know you have the \u2013 the Cognitive WiFi portfolio in Mojo, but is the Wireless portfolio right now a pretty robust or is that an area where you are thinking about or would need to expand? Jayshree Ullal : It's a good question. In the smaller enterprise sites, we often see that the conversation is led with WiFi, because they want to start with a small configuration of campus and they don't need to think of all the protocols. We feel we have a very complete portfolio, particularly with the introduction of WiFi6, but in larger enterprises, it's actually the other way around. Often the WiFi has to integrate with other partners like ClearPass, and we lead more with the X3 Splines. So it depends on the nature of the enterprise customers, but we see a bit of both. Brian Young : Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Brian. Chuck Elliott : This concludes the Arista Q3 2019 Earnings Call. Thank you for all the good questions and for the opportunity to highlight our financial results and corporate achievements for you. I also want to mention that we have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results which you can access on the Investor section of our website. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you during the quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2019. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the Company's website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks\u2019 management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions, and the impact of litigations, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Our profitability growth combination was once again demonstrated with a non-GAAP revenue of $654.4 million with a non-GAAP earnings per share that grew to a record $2.69. Services contributed approximately 15% of revenue. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.4%, influenced by a solid performance from our cloud titan and enterprise verticals. In terms of customer trends, we registered a record number of new customers in Q3 and continue to drive this new customer logo expansion at the rate of one to two per day throughout the quarter. For calendar 2019, we do expect to have two customers that will be greater than 10% of our revenue, Microsoft and Facebook. In Q3, the cloud titan vertical segment remained our largest one. The modern enterprise segment is now consistently becoming our second largest with financials in third place and service provider and tier 2 specialty cloud providers coming in at fourth and fifth place. In terms of geography, in Q3, the international contribution was 19% with the Americas at 81%. In terms of new products, we introduced important enhancements to our CloudVision platform, the [ph] CloudVision 2019. Arista\u2019s CloudVision is bringing cloud principles to network operators across places in the cloud or PICs, as we call it. The largest cloud providers in the world have driven advancements in telemetry and automated network operations that improve many of the same network operations tasks for the enterprise. CloudVision ups the ante to deliver these analytic and telemetry capabilities to organizations in the enterprise of many sizes. Key highlights of CloudVision 2019 include dynamic scale, elastic agility, deep visibility, and open integration where we can divide visibility metrics from SDK and SNMP-capable platforms including managing third-party devices to bring multi-vendor capabilities across the entire enterprise. I would like to offer some further color on Q4 2019 guidance, given our significant drop. After we experience the pause of a specific cloud titan\u2019s orders in Q2 2019, we were expecting a recovery in second half 2019 for cloud titan spend. In fact, Q3 2019 is a good evidence of that. However, we were recently informed of a shift in procurement strategy with a material reduction in demand from a second cloud titan, reducing their forecasts dramatically from original projections for both Q4 2019 and for calendar 2020. Naturally, this type of volatility brings a sudden and severe impact to our Q4 guidance. Given this tepid forecast and volatility of this cloud segment, we believe the cloud titan forecast should be modeled as flat to down in calendar 2020. I do want to take an opportunity to reiterate that our market share for both 100-gig and overall high-performance switching remains solid and strong. We are proud of our strength in the enterprise and financial segment with growing success in our very first quarter of shipping Cognitive Campus portfolio products, which is now on track for $100 million in the first full year of shipments. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for more specific financial metrics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2019 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $654.4 million, up 16% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance of $647 million to $657 million. Service revenues remained strong, representing approximately 15.2% of revenue, down from 15.6% last quarter, reflecting typical seasonality of service renewals. International revenues for the quarter came in at a $122.1 million or 19% of total revenue, down from 27% in the prior period. This volatility in geographical mix is largely driven by shifts towards U.S. deployments, in our cloud titan business. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.4%, above the midpoint of our guidance of 62% to 65%, and down slightly from 64.7% last quarter. This reflects the healthy cloud titan contribution combined with good performance from our enterprise and financial verticals. Operating expenses for the quarter were $163 million or 24.9% of revenue, up slightly from last quarter at $158.7 million. R&D spending came in at a $.3 million or 16.1% of revenue, up from a $101.7 million last quarter. This reflected headcount growth and slightly higher levels of product-related NRE and prototype spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $46.8 million or 7.1% of revenue, up from last quarter, with increased headcount somewhat offset by reductions in other sales costs. Our G&A costs were consistent with last quarter at approximately $11 million, or 1.7% of revenue. Our operating income for the quarter was $258.2 million, or 39.4% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $14.9 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 20.5%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $217.1 million or 33.2% of revenue. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.75 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter $2.69, up 27.5% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.4 billion. We repurchased a $115 million of our common stock during the quarter, at a weighted average price of $224 per share. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a three-year $1 billion stock repurchase program commencing in Q2 \u201819. This program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically and will be funded with operating cash flows. We generated $269 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, reflecting strong net income performance and a decrease from working capital requirements of approximately $25 million. DSOs came in at 63 days, up 51 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 3.1 times, up from 2.4 last quarter. Inventory decreased to $239.8 million in the quarter, down from $314.2 million in the prior period. Our total deferred revenue balance was $529 million, up from $502.2 million in Q2. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services related with any significant product deferred revenue amounts having been recognized through the income statement in the first half of the year. Accounts payable days were 31 days, down from 37 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.7 million. [Ph]  Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to experience significant volatility of demand from our cloud business. We saw strong recovery from the customer who had paused activity in the second quarter only to be surprised by a dramatic reduction in forecast for Q4 and 2020 from another key titan. All indications are these actions do not [indiscernible] positioning our share for Arista at these customers but will likely result in demand from this part of the business being flat to down on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. While we're not at this point in a position to provide overall guidance for 2020, we did want to make the following points. Firstly, a recap on deferred revenue and its impact on 2019 results. As outlined in prior calls, we recognized $80 million and $38 million of non-Microsoft product deferred revenue in Q1 and Q2 \u201819, respectively. These amounts represented product sales, ships and bills in the prior year for which revenue was deferred, pending customer acceptance of legal redesigns and features. While not impacting our 2020 cash metrics, this does set up some tough comps for year-over-year revenue growth, particularly in the first quarter of 2020. At this point, we believe this trend combined with typical Q1 seasonality and the recent update to cloud forecast described above, may result in revenues for the first quarter of 2020 at approximately 5% [ph] Q4 \u201819 level. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix being the key driver. We will continue to manage investments in the business carefully with targeted growth in sales and R&D headcounts balancing the need to expand our market coverage with prudent financial management. Finally, you should expect to see us continue executing against the stock repurchase mandate in an opportunistic manner. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance of the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : Revenues of approximately $540 million to $560 million; gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 36%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5% with diluted shares of approximately 80.3 million. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager : Thank you, Ita. We\u2019re now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista conference call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Q - Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. I appreciate the added disclosures and details you've given us on this call. So, thanks for that. I wanted to maybe get a better understanding of the 2020 commentary, given that at least looking at CapEx as an indicator, or revenue for business lines like Azure and AWS seem to be encouraging, suggesting 2020 could be a better year in terms of the CapEx forecast going back double digits for the web scale guys. Just wondering how you think we should square your more cautious tone on the cloud relative to what looks like better capital spending trends and healthy revenue trends from the web titans? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. Well, as I was trying to explain, our Q4 forecast is actually quite consistent with many of the cloud CapEx reported in recent calls, which is overall flat to down. There's a lot of volatility going on [Technical Difficulty] going down but the overall trend for Q4 is down, and we're projecting that same flat to down trend for CapEx next year for the overall cloud titan spend. Now, one of the things that as you know, you may have remembered this, we were not tracking from a networking point of view in prior years [Technical Difficulty] cloud CapEx, nearly as nil --as well. So, there's not a one to one correlation. And in some cases, what we're seeing in the cloud CapEx is that redistribution to infrastructure, not to networking. So, if you look at the two reasons why we believe it will slow down also in 2020, it\u2019s because many of the cloud titan customers are extending their use of server assets and delaying the network purchase longer and buying other infrastructure or investing in other aspects. And the second is the 400-gig adoption. We had predicted initially that deployments could start as early as second half this year, we are shipping 400-gig products for initial trials this year. But, the initial deployments have shifted by more than a year to second half 2020. And we think mainstream production will be 2021. So, the change in customers extending their investments and the deployment of 400-gig is causing us to be more muted about 2020. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : [Technical Difficulty] If I could just follow up on the cloud titans again, maybe just a two-parter. Number one, could you talk a little bit about the customer that had the recent sudden change? And it seems it has a long tail to it as well. Any visibility as to why they're doing it, as their business is changing, or is it just as you said, just the spending is changing? And secondly, do you think this is a trend that highlights more -- even more than flat to down risks for some of the other large customers? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So, specific to the cloud titan whose forecast reduced dramatically, I think, there were two main reasons, and I'm going to ask Anshul, our cloud expert and COO to elaborate. First is, they are managing the CapEx for networking and modulating the inventory and shifting to more of a just-in-time type forecast. So, typically, they gave us two-quarter visibility, sometimes even three and four, and now, they're moving much more to a real time forecast at quarterly intervals. And the second is, this particular cloud titan is extending their server assets [ph] by more than a year. And once the server assets get extended, that is significantly delaying the network spend too. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Jayshree, that\u2019s absolutely right. The server request delay is specific decision for this one cloud titan, they didn\u2019t see enough ROI in doing the request just right now, they might rate [ph] generation, and the impact we\u2019re seeing as well, because they want to upgrade the network but they are not upgrading the server. Jayshree Ullal : And so, to answer the other part of your question, Tim, on other cloud titans, we think some will be stronger, some will be flat, some will be weaker. But, the average all of that we see flat to down. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Hi. I guess, I want to follow up then on your recent explanation here, Jayshree. I mean, the CapEx moving to just-in-time, that shouldn\u2019t affect your business, you might not have visibility, but that still means business needs to come in, as long as you keep building. I guess, moving to the server refresh cycle, is that where the bulk of your business with that cloud titan was, and just kind of refresh upgrade of existing platforms, there was no new build with this customer? Jayshree Ullal : Bulk of it was -- there is always multiple levels of connectivity. Bulk of it is obviously the first layer, you got to build servers for us to put a network. The second layer is usually regional sign [ph] and data center [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We are currently facing technical difficulty. The conference will resume monetarily. Thank you for your patience. Jayshree Ullal : Did you hear the answer, Ittai? Ittai Kidron : Yes. If you could repeat it? I think, everybody got disconnected in the mail. I hope it wasn't something I said. Jayshree Ullal : No. But, now I have to remember your question to repeat the answer. Ittai Kidron : The question is, again, we are reiterating the question regarding the nature of your business with them, is it just tied to sever refresh, is there no new build, new greenfield build with them? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No. And the answer is, clearly don't start with -- if you don't have servers and storage, we can't connect with the network. So, the nature of our use cases starts with server spend correlated to network spend, which in turn creates layers of additional titans which can be the aggregation or the regional titans as well. But, that's the symptom, and the cause is more networking spend. Now, that doesn't mean they don't spend on new data centers. I think, the CapEx serves many of the cloud titans, including the one we're discussing, reflects that they will spend in a healthy fashion of the infrastructure for new data centers. But, to correlated that back to networking will take time. Because first they have to buy the new servers and then they have to buy the network, which could go well into late 2020 or 2021, most likely. Ittai Kidron : Maybe as a follow-up, Microsoft just won the JEDI contract, what does that mean to you, how do you look at that and what it could do for your business? Jayshree Ullal : We\u2019re very pleased with that. And as you can imagine, Anshul and the team work very hard on federal certifications and partnership with our cloud titan vendors. Having said that, the first thing that happens with these large contracts is they get contested. So, while the award may be given, we think it will be time for us to see material benefit, may take 6 to 12 months. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Just moving beyond your commentary about the volatility and spending from the cloud titans, I just wanted to ask about the tier 2 cloud providers. It sounds like you have more visibility or more stability in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of spending patterns from them. Is that fair, or if you can elaborate on what you see on that side? And does this kind drive you to focus more on that segment going forward? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Samik, thank you. While majority of our guidance was due to the specific cloud titan, you might have noticed in my commentary that both the service providers and the specialty tier 2 cloud providers came in at 4th and 5th place. I think this is the first time the specialty tier 2 cloud providers have been deadlocked. [Ph] And in my view, the segment is weak and the results have been mixed. I think, the new tier 2 company -- specialty cloud companies that started growing very well for us in 2017 and \u201818 are now having to review their investments and decide from a matter of economics which ones make more sense, do they rely on their own cloud or go to the public cloud titan. And some of the tier 2 companies are finding it difficult to compete, some are continuing with this strategy. So, it is a mix bag for us. And especially in Q4, we don\u2019t expect much success from this category. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham and Company. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time relative to this cloud issue. To what extent you are confident that there is no competitive incursion here that\u2019s causing it, and in fact you have sustained share at that customer? How can we judge that, how do you get your arms around -- clarity around that point? Jayshree Ullal : Alex, that\u2019s a very good question. From our perspective, the competitive dynamics have not changed in the cloud or in general. We always have aggressive competition and we will continue to see aggression there. But, what gives us confidence, the cloud titans are delaying their spend or distributing their CapEx differently is as you know we always pride ourselves in close partnership and relationship with cloud titans. And generally, especially in the case of Facebook and Microsoft, they\u2019ve been not only a vendor customer relationship but really a co-development that requires the kind of partnership which is engineering to engineering, not just business. So, when you look at that, there is no evidence that competitively or white box wise, there has been any change. There has been process change. There is better inventory management, there is better procurement, optimization et cetera. And you can always expect these cloud customers want to be multi-sourced but it isn\u2019t any different than we\u2019ve seen in the past in behavior, relationship, in art, innovation. We have 10 400-gig products and a lot of them are in trials. So, relationship and the technology partnership couldn\u2019t be better. Anshul, do you want to add to that. Anshul Sadana : Alex, we work very closely with these customers to a point that we\u2019re working on the 2021 roadmap along with these customers right now, and quite well aware of the changes they are making to the architecture as well, and have very direct feedback from customers as well that there is no alternate that's displacing us. It\u2019s simply that demand has gone down. And we are very confident of our share, when that demand comes back as well, since we collaborate with these customers. So, we're not worried about it and the customers are pretty direct as well. This is not our share going to someone else, their demand reduced. Alex Henderson : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thanks very much. Adding my pull-ups to the other questions that have already been asked. On this change in, architecture and strategy and what they're doing with their servers, is this related to how they're implementing servers and networking, obviously, by extension, so that we're looking at a permanent lengthening of replacement cycles, or is this somehow just related to the current cycle? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense for what the -- even as the customers come back, what the opportunity is and how we should think about the frequency that they'll need to come back and add additional capacity or upgrade networking equipment, et cetera? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Good question, James. You may know that several cycles tend to go in 18 months to three years. And generally, they get upgraded in that type of timeframe. In this particular case, because of the server vendor, and architecture -- the server vendor, there is no change in server architecture, and I have to emphasize that. They are choosing to delay this server -- new server deployment by at least a year. So, it\u2019s no more, no less, no change in architecture, but really a delay of servicing, which is causing a delay in network spend. Anshul Sadana : Great. And then, that has some short-term impact on the IO need from these servers. If there\u2019s no new server, they may not need as much IO that they are planning on. But in the long run, these things do balance out, this is near term estimate, so one year type of cycle until they do start their refresh. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll shift gears a little bit. As you think about the model and the growth rates that you've outlined looking into next year, I'm just kind of curious, do you take a more active stance and kind of project -- protecting the margin profile the Company? And, how do I think about just the investments that the Company\u2019s previously kind of alluded to that would be required to really position yourself for campus ramp as we move into next year. And just any kind of commentary on how you've seen campus thus far? Ita Brennan : Yes. I'll take the model question and then, Jayshree can take the campus question. As we think about the business as we go forward, I think we believe we can operate hopefully in the plus or minus 35% operating margin model that we talked about for some time, and we talked about as far as the long-term model. We are guiding 36% for Q4, even with the kind of reductions in revenue, right. So, we do have some flexibility there. But, I think you have to probably expect that you won\u2019t see the 39% and 40% type operating margin numbers that we've been putting up more recently. So, we will continue to make investments that will be targeted. You\u2019ll see us continue to invest in sales and market side because we think that's important as we go forward, and on headcount et cetera and R&D as well. But we think we can still do it within that envelop. Jayshree Ullal : And regarding campus, as I said in my opening remarks, we are marching well to the $100 million in shipments for the first four quarters. Q3 was our first quarter. What surprised me pleasantly on campus acceptance is half our customers are existing but half are new. If you were to ask me to forecast that, I wouldn't have embedded that. I would have thought 80% would be existing. So, we're really getting a lot of interest in our campus. In fact, I would say, one of the strong reasons our enterprise segment is number two is not only because of the data center, but small numbers in the campus in Q3 but I believe the two will influence each other, that we will become more relevant in the enterprise because of both, campus and enterprise, and the architectural shift that we can guide to public workloads versus private. I think, when I look at why, we're very differentiated. The cognitive to us is really architectural, both on our Wi-Fi and POE switches and displaying the CloudVision. So, customers are really appreciating our differentiation on flow analysis, on security, on bringing an integrated cognitive, secure, software driven integration together much like we did with the data center. So, we like our early progress and execution there. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks. I have more of clarifications than a question. I just wanted to make sure we all understand that the account that's driving this downside here is not historically largest customer. And then, the second part of that is, given the disruption that you saw from Microsoft earlier in the year, I guess what's the context of their spend level as they go into Q4 and into the 2020? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So, just to clarify, Alex, it\u2019s the second cloud titan, it\u2019s not the one we mentioned the last time that had a Q2... Alex Kurtz : Right. Jayshree Ullal : And, specific to Microsoft, we\u2019re projecting -- we fully expect them to be a north of 10% customer concentration for 2019. And we expect to have a second new cloud titan customer which will be Facebook. Alex Kurtz : And just into 2020 around Microsoft, just given the disruption we saw this year, Jayshree, how do you -- any early read on what kind of returning to more normalized spend in 2020 with them? Jayshree Ullal : Anshul, do you want to say a few words? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Alex, so far, we don't have a long-term guidance for Microsoft, but there is no, nothing different then they are on a usual spend pattern. So, we have not given any other than\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : No blip, no pause, not yet. Anshul Sadana : That's correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Your line is open. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. As you reflect on the fundamentals technology drivers of bandwidth growth in the cloud that contributed to very strong growth over the years, has anything fundamentally changed? I asked because this year we have had sort of -- two different cloud vendors have some sort of hiccup. One was probably a public cloud vendor, the other content cloud vendor. So, completely different drivers and yet you\u2019re seeing the pause. [Ph] So, is there any sort of technology fundamental change? Jayshree Ullal : Tejas, I don't see any fundamental change. I think, our strategy is in TAM is valid. I think, their strategy that they want to invest, has been very strong, the last four or five years. Perhaps the only change I would allude to is they are adding more process, more optimization, more care and feed into their forecasting, more discipline, more hygiene. But, I don\u2019t see any other change. I think, they continue to invest with scale and as you know they are all doing very well. But, that doesn\u2019t mean they will spend equally well. Anshul Sadana : Tejas, the pause, as I mentioned, in Q2 was very tied to some internal financial planning for the customers and inventory planning, it was nothing to do with architecture or bandwidth and fund. And the second instance you\u2019re seeing right now there is the other cloud titan is with their server refresh. But when you model these out long-term there is no change in their growth expectations of traffic and networking need, both from a bandwidth standpoint as well as backbone and traffic engineering need. And with video storage and now AI workloads growing, there is always going to be more and more need for networking. So, we're not seeing that trend change. But obviously we have to wait for this customer come back and do the refresh. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. And a quick follow-up, any change in enterprise spending? I realize your share of that market is lower, but are you seeing any deal elongation and so forth at all? Jayshree Ullal : Too early. As you say, we are not the bellwether on enterprise. So, I think we understand the cloud much better. Because we are new entrant and we have new products, we're probably not the best indicator of change. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : I have just one question. The change in the picture, strategy of this cloud titan, why won't it spread to both, other cloud titan and maybe even the second tier type cloud titan? Is there the risk of that or any visibility of why this challenge won\u2019t spread? Thank you, Jim. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. I will comment and I will have Anshul elaborate. I think, the short answer is, no, we don\u2019t see a lot of risk of that because anyway, visibility was two quarters. With this particular titan, they\u2019ve optimized it to one quarter. So, if you were always relying on one and two-year forecast that would be a bigger dramatic change to our belief system and how we plan with them. But since it\u2019s always been one or two quarters and a further refinement on this particular cloud titan customer to one quarter only, we don\u2019t see a big change or big shift. Anshul Sadana : And then, this is their own internal process and planning on how they plan networking purchases with respect to data center facilities going live. And they are optimizing their processing and their org, and fixing issues they might have had in the past. This does not apply to any of our other cloud titans. So, very specific organization issues in a company, not an industry trend or a technology trend. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : I wanted to just check what you\u2019re thinking on growth in 2020, I\u2019m just playing around with the verticals here and thinking about what maybe you're implying with this. So, I wonder if you could put us in some sort of a ballpark for overall revenue growth. And then talk to us about why the down eight or so that you are implying in the guidance doesn't materialize through a better part of next year, so you end up with even lower revenue growth or maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re already thinking. So, that\u2019s one thing. If you could just put us in some kind of a revenue growth ballpark for next year? And then, the other thing I wanted to ask is enterprise spending is clearly very weak. And a lot of the rest of this growth depends on enterprise. And so, I wonder if you could just update us on what you're seeing there. How much risk you think there is your enterprise numbers as we look into 2020, or at least early part of it with the slowdown that we're observing? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I'll take the first part of that and then maybe hand out to Jayshree on the last part. I think from a model perspective, we're not yet trying to call a 2020 growth rate for the overall business. I think, we've tried to put some points out there and make sure everybody is aligned on some of the impacts from deferred et cetera. But, I think, as we enter the year, we will have a tough comp for the first quarter, particularly in the second quarter as well to some extent because of the deferred. We talked about the cloud vertical being flat to down. What we\u2019ve seen pretty consistently is that the enterprise, part of the business and financial verticals have been growing well, and have been offsetting that, although not entirely, right? And we hope that that will continue, that we continue to see that. So, that's kind of an offset to the part of the business, which is really the cloud and service provider pieces, which have been used as we\u2019ve gone through this year. I think Q1, I think we pretty much guided to Q1 number only because we want to make sure we reflect the deferred correctly, that we reflect the seasonality of Q1 and correcting them up. Rod Hall : Okay. And then enterprise, if you want to -- can you tell us what? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. On enterprise, I do believe from a demand and TAM perspective, we have a lot of opportunity for execution. And we could do very well, both in enterprise and financials. If we get affected by macro situations that affects everyone, not just us, so we would be influenced by that. But barring any macro situation, we feel very good about our execution to-date and going into 2020. And that'll hopefully offset some of the flatness in the cloud. Rod Hall : Just coming back on the numbers. I mean, I\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Go ahead, Rod. Rod Hall : Okay. Well, I was just going to say, I mean, it looks to me like it could easily be mid single digits growth next year. And I don't know if that's a crazy number from your point of view, or is that a plausible scenario? Jayshree Ullal : I don't think it's a crazy number. We\u2019d have to grow enterprise into significant double digits. I think at this point, we're not feeling strongly optimistic about the mid teens growth that we projected at the analyst day, because of how poorly cloud is doing. Right? Everybody else is -- and the enterprise and financials is doing well. But, how about you give us -- looking into Q4, Q1 and then will come back to you. We don't know. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I guess a question of clarification. Just to ensure the entire $130 million revenue miss versus the [indiscernible], was that all attributed to this cloud titan customer shifting patterns or was that something else? That's one part. And then, secondly, maybe we could just touch on what you saw the enterprise side and do you think most of the a meaningful driver, revenue growth as you get into calendar 2020? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So quickly to answer your question, Amit. The specific titan was the absolutely the largest part of the gap and guidance. But, they were declines. As you know we've had a deteriorating declining performance in service provider, and new to the mix was a deteriorating and declining performance in tier 2 specialty cloud too. So, it was a combination of all three with majority being one specific cloud titan. Now, specific to Mojo, Mojo is very much factored into our campus numbers, and we think the whole wired, wireless, cognitive, edge is really getting ignited with the Mojo product. We have completed our integration of CloudVision and Wi-Fi. Our distributed cloud managed Mojo is better than many of the standard controller offerings and legacy offerings in the market place. So we believe our campus is doing well and a good contribution from that is Mojo. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Young with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Young : Hi. Can you talk about what's changed on the 400-gig side? It sounds like the anticipated deployment for 400-gig have been pushed out one year from your initial estimate. So, kind of interested to get your view on what you think is causing those delayed deployments. Jayshree Ullal : I think when we first began our 400-gig foray, you may have remembered, Andy Bechtolsheim spoke about it. We were always concerned, not whether we would have products and differentiated ones, which we do, we\u2019re shipping 10 types of products now, but whether the optics was ready and the ecosystem was ready. So, we thought the ecosystem would be ready by now and the optics have pretty much moved a year. Correct me, if am wrong, Anshul. So, by virtue of -- you cannot build 400-gig products and anything more than trials, if you don't have good optics to connect to it. So, by virtue of the 400-gig optics moving, we believe most of the initial deployments will move from second half this year, which is what we thought before, the second half 2020, which means production installations from thousands of ports to millions ports will really be 2021. But I want to be clear that we are shipping 400-gig products. We're very proud of them. And as always, we are ahead of the industry. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Two related questions, if I may. One, I just wanted to make sure I\u2019ve heard you correctly, first before the question, which is, you said, two 10% could titan customers, Microsoft and Facebook for 2019, is that the same in terms of the time period? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. That's correct. Paul Silverstein : Okay. And you also said that the particular cloud titan question is the problem is shifted to one quarter from a two-quarter forecast, correct? Jayshree Ullal : Well the forecasts were anywhere from two to four quarters, and they\u2019ve now shifted specifically to one quarter. Paul Silverstein : All right. Here are the two questions. One, with respect to the softness in 2020, putting aside 4Q \u201819, with respect to 2020, you made the point previously that with Microsoft, when you have that -- when they went [indiscernible] previously, you said the real question isn\u2019t them coming back but to what degree. So, when you talk about the softness and significant decline in 2020, I presume they giving you that insight, notwithstanding the shift to one quarter forecast away from the previous two to four-quarter forecast. It sounds like they've given you visibility into next year. Jayshree Ullal : That's correct. Paul Silverstein : How much softness are you talking about or you\u2019re expecting at this point? The other related question, somewhat different, but... Jayshree Ullal : If you can allow me to answer that, Paul, and then we can get to the other question. Paul Silverstein : Sure. Jayshree Ullal : This particular cloud titan has not only given us a dramatic reduction for Q4 2019 but has given us a dramatic reduction for much of 2020. So, unless the other cloud titans, there is a pause and they come back and it\u2019s more consistent, we fully expect this particular cloud titan to reduce next year significantly. Paul Silverstein : Then, on the broader question, 400-gig -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think you made this point publically in the past that with respect to your business, selling inter-data center switches for at least fine [ph] top of rack, there is a 12.8 terabit upgrade cycle driven by new Broadcom silicon, Tomahawk and Trident as well as [indiscernible]. In that, if 400-gig optics aren\u2019t ready, the various cloud titans will buy the for hire capacity switches that you and Cisco and Juniper are introducing and just deploy them in high density 100-gig configurations until the 400-gig is ready and/or is at the right price points. That sounds like -- it sounds like you\u2019ve changed your thinking on that. Jayshree Ullal : No. There is no change in thinking that Jericho and Tomahawk, Trident will be used with higher capacity in 100-gig configuration. So, we will continue to see incremental deployments of that. No change there. But there won\u2019t be a wholesale change from 100-gig to 400-gig in this time until 2021. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, we can\u2019t ask to speak for your customers, that will be unfair. But does that imply that there's been -- maybe this is obvious, but doesn\u2019t that imply there is been a change in demand on the part of cloud titans in general to the extent that if the demand were there, again they are deploying 400-gig, would just deploy a lot more 100-gig and the impact to you as they switch vendor, it would be relatively nominal you won't see it, we won't see it. But it clearly appears that there is a general softness in demand. Anshul Sadana : To your overall theme, we do very well and have good products that are 12.8 terabit, 128 by 100-gig switches. That point is well covered and customers do by that as necessary for their architecture. The dramatic change for one of the cloud titans is really coming from them delaying this for refresh with delays on network change that they otherwise would have done, which would have added more capacity. So, it gets delayed until they start that refresh, because these architects just go hand in hand. You don\u2019t touch the network and it goes independently, it goes together [indiscernible] whole architecture. On the 400-gig side, the investor delays in general because seeing the entire ecosystem and many of the optics companies forgot about compatibility, which doesn\u2019t work with cloud companies because 400 has to work with two by 100 on the other side and so on. Otherwise you can\u2019t upgrade a large network and everyone is going through those motions to get the entire ecosystem ready, which will take at least a year before it starts getting the production. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : I guess, I clearly understand the downtick in cloud spending over the course of the next few quarters. And now we want to start thinking about what your comments mean about when we might come through the other side of that. It sounded as though 12, or 18, 24 months after a server refresh is over is a typical timeframe as you push it out six months for whatever reason that would strike me as being maybe in the fourth quarter of 2020, but more likely 2021 -- does that the mask kind of workout? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Jeff, I think, the reason we're saying the cloud titan forecast will be flat to down in 2020 is because any projections of optimism and growth is the earliest possible is Q4 2020. We\u2019re really thinking the impact to 2021 to get beyond this flat to down forecasts. And you're right a server cycle that\u2019s delayed by a year means it\u2019s a year from now, which means any impact to IO is a year from now, any kind of production deployment is over a year from now. So, I think 12 months is a good rule of thumb as a minimum. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. I'm just trying to square away some of the commentary here. And to give you some context before my next question is that some of the third-party multi-tenant colocation providers have reported some of their strongest backlog quarters, all for data center capacity commencing in Europe in 2020. Now, the fair majority of those big bookings are actually being driven by cloud titan. So, as these cloud titans expand internationally, is there a difference in topology, architecture that is taking place because of the way they're building, the way they're connecting? That means that possibly alternative vendors would be more favorable, or is this just a completely different -- are we looking at something that is completely uniquely different than we\u2019ve ever seen before? Jayshree Ullal : Sami, typically, the cloud titans deploy us globally. As you know, we have a lot of international data center that they have built with us. And as they expand to additional data centers, the only difference is not architecture but size of the data center. So, depending on whether they're going into highly populated densities or smaller, they don't -- they will repeat the same architecture, but the scale and size may vary, which means they really, really wanted to be one uniform of architecture, ideally with one consistent software and one vendor. So, it is very rare to see that they will repeat it with a different vendor. So, I don't see any uniqueness in the international data centers except size. Sami Badri : Thank you for that color. And then, just -- sorry, one follow-up on\u2026 Charles Yager : Sami, we\u2019re running out of time here. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your lines is open. Erik Suppiger : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I just want to understand, if this issue with the Titans is beyond this one customer as you get into 2020, because it looks like you're reducing the outlook for Q4 by call it 20ish percent of revenue. And I'm not sure if we should carry that through and it seems like one customer who presumably is not 10%, why would we be cutting it that much? So is this more endemic across the broader titan universe or how should we be thinking about this? Jayshree Ullal : I think what we're saying is our numbers are very large with the cloud titans. And we will do very well with some, the smaller ones, we may be flattish to down with the larger ones, depending on this trend. And when you cumulatively add all of this, it's going to be flat to down in revenue. I don't think it means -- it's not a trend for overall the next three to five years it\u2019s a projection of what specifically will happen in 2020, especially because they\u2019re going to, lift their servers, leverage their existing infrastructure, keep adding 100-gig to that, not quite move to 400-gig, we see 2020 as a transition year with our cloud titan in terms of high performance as well. So, I wouldn't read anything more to the forecast except for 2020, it will pick up later on. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hey, guys. So, I want to understand just one thing. Most of the questions were asked, I want to understand, if you look at 2020 and you remove this one customer because next quarter you're going to have a down year, revenue down year-over-year, and I think you said also 2020. So, now I'm trying to understand if I remove this one customer that was really bad this quarter and provided this $120 million, $130 million shortfall, then what's the underlying growth of everything else? Is 2020 the story of one bad customer who is kind of rethinking strategy or is 2020 going to be down even if you remove that particular customer? Jayshree Ullal : Well, loaded question. I think the way to think of this is, we have three types of cloud titans, some large ones that will main flat, some that will go down and some that will go up, and the aggregate of that is flat to down. Anshul, do you want to add it to that or did I get that right? Anshul Sadana : That\u2019s right\u2026 Tal Liani : Right. I understand that's a very general answer. I mean, at the end of the daym, there is one big customer who is down $120 million off $670 million that's a giant number. So, we have to remove that to understand what's happening with the rest of it. So, when you do the math, is the rest of it is still up or its still going to be down? Jayshree Ullal : First of all, remember, rest of it, we don't have hundreds of customers here, we have a handful. So, the cloud titans... Tal Liani : There is still 550, right. The per quarter its still 550. I mean, it\u2019s still meaningful, right? Jayshree Ullal : I think we have to step back a little bit. It\u2019s not like we have perfect visibility of what we think is going to happen in 2020 yet, right. I think what we're saying is what we have this issue with this particular customer, which is a large customer and has some significant impact. We have the rest of cloud, which has been unpredictable this year. That's the reality of life. We will see how it clears out next year, but sure we are not aggressively forecasting that right now, right? We have service provider, which hasn\u2019t been performing well and we just saw, specialty cloud vertical is kind of go to the bottom of the it, right. Offsetting that has been some good traction in enterprise and financials, and we saw them grow well in Q3, right. But, it\u2019s not enough to offset completely, which is why we say, the flat to down is significant for the rest of the business. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter : Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I know that you guys are making quite a bit of progress on the routing side. I know, there are a number of larger cloud provider customers that were looking into your routing products. Is that an opportunity for you to offset some of the softness you're seeing in the cloud side, is the incremental success with routing, any insight there would be great. And then one other clarification, if you could just repeat the deferred revenue metrics that you referenced earlier that would be helpful. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. George, you are very right. We are doing -- our strongest use cases for routing are with the cloud providers. So, beside all the several et cetera, these tend to be obviously stronger in value and fewer in number but we're doing very well with virtually all the cloud providers, cloud titans on routing. And we are doing very well in general in routing. It's improving for us on our landscape with tier 2 cloud providers as well in the routing use case specifically. So, we do look at that as an opportunity for next year as well. Ita Brennan : And then just on the deferred, in terms of continuation from what we saw in the first half of '19. We have recognized $80 million in product deferred in Q1, $30 million of product deferred in Q2, that have basically been fixed and billed in the prior period. So, from a revenue perspective [indiscernible] Q1. From a cash prospective, it\u2019s different obviously because that deferred revenue didn\u2019t contribute cash for this year, but from a revenue perspective it\u2019s obviously higher bar. Operator : Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli. Your line is open. Hendi Susanto : I would like to understand more about the cloud titan phenomenon of delaying the use. Is there risk that other customers whether a cloud titan or not maybe have similarly, perhaps you can share some technical insight when a large customer to extend the use of server assets and when it cannot? Anshul Sadana : All of those cloud titan customers have their own architecture and the choice of mix and the 25, 50 [indiscernible]. And if you look at the industry the cloud is actually not aligned to the exact same servers, CPU upgrade cycle, there offset from each other in a manner aligned with the [indiscernible] update from the industry as well. This particular decision does seem specific to only one titan, we have not heard this from anyone else and the others keep on adding capacity as they need. But this one customer for them, there wasn\u2019t enough ROI, so they decided to delay their upgrade. So, I would just read it the way we have heard it from our customers and that was not [indiscernible]. Operator : Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open. John Marchetti : I just wanted to go back to comment and make sure that I heard you right Jayshree, when you were talking about the overall outlook for \u201820 ex the cloud business, if I go back to that analyst day presentation and how you guys talked about sort of cloud adding a few points growth to take you up into that sort of upper teens range. If we strip that out altogether for next year or even assume it's down a little bit, do we still consider the rest of the business ex that cloud still being in that sort of low double-digit to mid teens range? I just want to make sure I heard -- the way the you answered Rod\u2019s question Jayshree Ullal : Good question, John. I think just going back to the analyst day, what Ita said or Arista said more specifically, if the cloud did really well, would be in the high teens; if the cloud did average, would be in the mid teens. The current projections we\u2019re getting on the cloud is below that average that we thought was the norms. So with the new norm being flat to down, mid teens is off the table right now for 2020. Ita, do you want to add to that. Ita Brennan : No. I think that\u2019s right. We hadn\u2019t contemplated the world at that point where cloud would be flat to down, just that we were contemplating we were kind of thinking between slowish growth and faster growth right. I don\u2019t think anybody in that space would have thought that there will be in the world where we would see that part of the business would actually be down to -- flat to declining. Charles Yager : Thank you, John. We have time for one more question, operator. Operator : Your last question comes from Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Andrew Vadheim : Recognizing revenue pressures in 4Q and 2020, silver lining potentially could be through growth in other segments, maybe campus starts to ramp over the medium term, enterprise shows strength and maybe service provider recovers, and you would start to have more of a structural business to higher overall gross margin. Is that something that you perhaps just go ahead and embrace with more immediacy and invest faster and even more heavily in non-cloud, maybe the expensive cloud than previously would have anticipated? Jayshree Ullal : You're right to point out that our business hasn't fundamentally changed. Our fundamentals are great. Our gross margins are 62 to 65. Our TAM is valid. We could grow in other places. But, I don't think we would want to forecast below -- beyond the 63 to 65. Because I think we're in the band. If our cloud goes down, we should be on the higher end of the band. If our cloud goes up, we'll be at the lower end of the band. We don\u2019t see the band itself going up more. That being said, we\u2019re absolutely committed to R&D, we're absolutely committed to targeted hiring and investing. We think we can do that, like Ita said with a 35%ish operating margin. And so, no change in strategy in continuing to invest in R&D and sales and marketing, as well as M&A where it make sense to grow our other businesses and segments. Charles Yager : Thank you, Andrew. That concludes the Arista Q3 2019 earnings call. Please note that we have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results. which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis McKee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Curtis McKee : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer, Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31 2019. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company\u2019s website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions, and the impact of litigations, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn it over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Curtis. And welcome to your first Arista earnings call and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. We delivered a non-GAAP revenue of $552.5 million with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Services contributed approximately 19% of the revenue consistent with the typically higher renewables at the year-end. Our non-GAAP gross margins was 65.2%, influenced by a strong performance of the enterprise vertical and associated software-attached products. Overall our 2019 gross margin came in at 64.7%. We registered a record number of 1 dollar customers in Q4 as a direct result of our enterprise momentum. By the end of 2019, we have acquired over 6300 customers cumulatively with Microsoft at 23% of total revenue and Facebook at 16.6%. In Q4, 2019 and actually much throughout the year, cloud titans was the largest vertical. The enterprise segment is now consistently the second largest and strongest segment followed by the financials in third place, tier 2 cloud specialty providers in fourth and service providers in fifth place. Both service providers and tier 2 cloud providers have been slow for us. Arista as you know, in terms of geography, 2019 international contribution was 24% with the Americas at 76%. In terms of new products in 2019 Arista as you know delivered a banner year of disruptive products redefining networking with a highly differentiated software stack management and flagship platforms. The 7280 and 7500 Series especially have become the gold standard in 100 gigabit spine networking. We also introduced substantial 400-gigabit innovations with 10 new platforms. We launched a new portfolio of cognitive campus edge products for wired, Power over Ethernet switches and wireless including Wi-Fi 6. Our inherent software flexibility brings federated management and control plans across multiple merchant silicon data planes and this is one of our key differentiators. We continued our systematic innovations in cloud U.S. and CloudVision features. In particular, we have doubled our CloudVision customers delivering real-time streaming telemetry, availability, scale, automation with change control, as well as third-party in profitability. We are pleased with the increased acceptance of total software bookings both in subscription and perpetual licenses now approaching 5% of total revenue annually. We began Q1, 2020 with the close of our third acquisition, Big Switch Networks, an SDN pioneer founded almost a decade ago. This is a strategic step for us in brining a strong combination of engineering expertise deeper entry into the network packet broker market and increased software multi-cloud visibility. As you know we've always been focused on software-driven networking as a mission in Arista. With Big Switch, we are expanding that mission to a more deep analytic strength complementing our switch based dense or data analyzer platforms with Big Switch's deeper monitoring fabric across public, private and hybrid clouds. Both companies also share a unique visionary status with data center networking in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. We welcome the BCN team -- BSN team into Arista family and really look forward to a strengthened partnership, not only with them, but with Dell Technologies as well as with approximately 300 customers we're getting to know better. While the Big Switch acquisition is not material, we do expect this to contribute to our software strength and bookings and our goal is to become accretive in calendar 2021. As we wrap 2019, I really do believe that Arista is in the clear forefront of making cloud area networking more and more mainstream. We see that networking and the future of it is not silos or boxes with multiple operating systems and Spaghetti OS'. But a new uniform software-driven place in the cloud architecture. We are proud of our market leadership with the number 1 spot in 100 gigabit Ethernet switching and ready for 400-gigabit migration ahead of us. We are experiencing trials that are going well with several customers. We are poised to achieve our first $100 million target for the first four quarters of campus revenue as well. Our go-to-market strength continues to be an important investment area for us as we have doubled the sales and systems engineering capacity over the past two years. With the promotion of Chris Smith to Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales; and Ashwin Kohli to Senior Vice President of Customer Engineering, reporting to Anshul Sadana, the transition to their new roles has been seamless, following the departure of Manny Rivelo to a PE firm in conjunction with his executive advisory role to us. Both Chris and Ashwin have long tenure with us and epitomize the Arista ways. As I've traveled the world including hundreds of customers we touch, it is clear to me that we're winning strategic enterprise franchises across high-tech, media, banking, healthcare, insurance, and retail sectors to name a few. Large enterprises are increasingly frustrated and anxiously seeking better quality and architectural leverage to cloud-based principles. Our programmability with software and quality with the lowest critical vulnerabilities in the networking industry is a refreshing and welcome change to them. Arista is gaining strategic relevance almost doubling our million dollar customers within the past three years. I expect this momentum to continue and happen across all the non-cloud verticals. With that, I'll turn it over to Ita for more financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2019 results and our guidance for Q1 2020 based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $552.5 million, down 7% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance of $540 million to $560 million. Service revenues represented approximately 19% of total revenue up from 15.2% last quarter, reflecting typical fourth quarter service renewal seasonality in conjunction with the lower product revenue number. International revenues for the quarter came in at $137.7 million or 25% of total revenue, up from 19% in the third quarter. Looking to the year, international revenues accounted for 24% of total revenue, down from 28% in the prior year. This shift in geographical mix for the year was largely driven by heavier U.S. deployments by our cloud titan customers. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 65.2% above the upper end of our guidance range of 63% to 65%, and up from 64.4% last quarter. This reflected a lighter cloud titan contribution in the period combined with good performance from our enterprise and financial verticals. Operating expenses for the quarter were $154.3 million or 27.9% of revenue, down from last quarter at $163 million. R&D spending came in at $96.2 million or 17.4% of revenue, down from $105.3 million last quarter. This decline largely reflected lower engineering and prototype costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $46.4 million or 8.4% of revenue with increased headcount somewhat offset by reductions in other sales costs. Our G&A costs were consistent with last quarter at approximately $12 million or 2.1% of revenue. Our operating income for the quarter was $205.8 million or 37.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $11.2 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 15.5%. This lower tax rate reflected the release of some uncertain tax position related reserves following final agreement with the relevant tax authorities. Please note, however, that we do expect to see some upward pressure on the effective tax rate over time. As various tax jurisdictions continue to modify their tax rules. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $183.4 million or 33.2% of revenue. Our diluted share number for the quarter was 80.26 million shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.29, up 1.8% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.7 billion. We repurchased $51.5 million of our common stock during the quarter at a weighted average price of $189 per share. This brings our total repurchases for the year to $266 million over three quarters. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a three-year $1 billion stock repurchase program commencing in Q2 2019. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically and is funded from operating cash flows. We generated $327 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter affecting strong net income performance and a decrease in working capital requirements of approximately $115.4 million. DSOs came in at 65 days, up from 63 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2.9 times, down from 3.1% last quarter. Inventory increased to $244 million in the quarter, up from $240 million in the prior period. Our total deferred revenue balance was $575 million, up from $529 million in Q3. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services related with any significant product deferred revenue amounts having been recognized to the income statement in the first half of the year. As Jayshree mentioned, we had two greater than 10% customers in the year; Microsoft at 23% and Facebook at 16.6%. If you exclude the recognition of product deferred revenue referenced above Facebook would have represented approximately 12% of revenue for the year. Accounts payable days were 44 days, up from 31 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.4 million. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. While we're not in a position at this point to provide full year guidance, we wanted to reiterate the various puts and takes discussed on our last call. 2019 has been a challenging year for our cloud business with significant volatility and an overall muted demand picture. As we look forward to 2020, we believe this trend continues with demand from this part of the business being flat to down on a year-over-year basis. This trend combined with tough year-over-year revenue comparisons due to the recognition of $118 million of product deferred revenue in the first half of 2019 will likely result in a meaningful decline in cloud revenue for 2020. Enterprise and financials are expected to grow healthily but are not yet large enough to fully offset the expected revenue decline from cloud, service provider and specialty cloud will likely remain sluggish for the year. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, the customer mix being the key driver. Focusing specifically on Q1, we expect to trend lower in this range, given a lighter revenue number and a typical first quarter weighting towards cloud. We'll continue to manage investments in the business carefully with target growth in sales and R&D headcount, balancing the need to expand our market coverage with prudent financial management. We announced the acquisition of Big Switch Networks earlier today. This represents an immaterial transaction, who brings us some additional software capabilities and a strong engineering talent pool. From a financial perspective, this is a software subscription business with upfront license revenue recognition and a fair amount of services deferred revenue. We're beginning the business and accounting integration now and the acquisition will be recorded in our financials for the first quarter. We have included a small revenue contribution and two months of expenses for Big Switch in our guidance for the first quarter. We will provide additional clarity on the go-forward income statement impacts, once we've completed the purchase accounting analysis. Finally our guidance for Q1 does not reflect any impact from the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China. While we do not have a significant direct manufacturing footprint in China, there may be some indirect supply chain impacts. We will look to monitor and attempt to mitigate these as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $522 million to $532 million, gross margin of approximately 63%, operating margins of approximately 34%. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% per diluted shares of approximately 80.5 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis? Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is open. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering on like the outlook you gave you saw your cloud Titan clients. So we understand like flat to slightly down year-on-year, which means that we'll have a bit of recovery during the year. And I think it's surprising that it contrasts \u2013 it's contrasting a lot with what we've heard from other suppliers on the compute side on the memory side. We've heard much \u2013 we\u2019ve seen much better numbers in the second half of last year and much more positive comments about the first half of this year. So you don't seem to be on a similar cycle things seems to be coming back slower for you guys. And so any way you could help us understand that would be very helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, Pierre. I will take part of the question and Anshul can elaborate. The cloud CapEx spending has never correlated 1 :1 with Arista's network numbers. And the reason is many because as you know it's a very small part of the total CapEx. It's almost negligible the network piece. And often they make the compute and the storage decisions first and the network comes later. So there's a lag. So our visibility right now, as I've often told you is one to two quarters. And we can't say much about the whole year let alone Q2 or second half. So while we are making predictions based on our 2019 both the absorption of deferred revenue and the current understanding of their plans, things might change. We're reflecting what we know best as of now, especially when you look at our year-over-year comps for 2018 and 2019. Anshul says, I did good enough. So there has nothing more to add. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks, Jayshree. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Pierre. Operator : Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to know if you could kind of give a little bit of an update on the campus business traction? And just whether you had seen any kind of pause in purchasing activity due to macro? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Well, thank you, Meta and thank you. I think it's the first call for you with Arista. So welcome. So as you know our campus business is in its very early stages. We only started shipping in Q3 2019. We've had two full quarters now of campus. And I'm very encouraged by the enthusiastic response from both our existing customers as well as new customer acquisition. As I look at our $1 million customers that I was talking about and the record number we have achieved, many of them have also been campus. And so we \u2013 I see that at least from our little Oasis or island, we're not really a macro bellwether, we're more of a technology bellwether and the technology on both on our POE and Wi-Fi has been very well accepted along with our clients and CloudVision. And Q4 was a very good indication of that. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. One, what are the priorities in terms of your integration with Big Switch? What are you going to be -- which products are you going to be focusing on? Then secondly, is there anything that we should be concerned about with China? Did you see any evidence of impact from the virus issues going on there? Jayshree Ullal : So I'll take the first question and Anshul maybe with your COO title you know more about what's going on there. So on the -- what's the priorities for the Big Switch? Well, as I said first of all, we were incredibly impressed by the engineering team. So we have selected the best of the best and they are very much part of the acquisition has closed, and I want to give a big shout out to Marc Taxay and Ita for the hard work that went into that. It's a 10-year old company there's a lot of detail. So the -- at the end of the close of the acquisition, we have absorbed approximately 75 employees, a large percentage of them in engineering. And there are two product lines that Big Switch carries, the BMS, which is the monitoring product, which is as I explained is a perfect complement to DANZ. DANZ is Arista's in-line integrated switching product and BMS is just icing on the cake, it has deeper visibility, service nodes, recorder nodes and monitoring fabric et cetera. And then BCF, which is meant for more of a converged fabric and we fully expect that to be a very important piece, especially with our converged infrastructure partners like Dell Technologies. So both products will be fully supported and carried through but with different channels. Anshul Sadana : To your question on China and supply chain with respect to coronavirus, as Ita mentioned, we don't do any direct manufacturing in China. So it really comes down to second degree effects of our manufacturer\u2019s suppliers or their sub-supplies or their raw material coming from China. So far we haven't seen any big impact, because it's just been a few weeks after -- really a few days after the end of the Chinese New Year. And our manufacturers are saying that's okay for the short-term. However, if the situation continues for a long period and there's where the supply is label of raw materials and over an extended time then it can have an impact in the future. But it's too early to say anything right now. And we expect more answers from the Chinese suppliers to the factories through the rest of the month and even in March. So it is too early, but for now we're okay. Erik Suppiger : Very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for the question, and girls. I wanted to -- I guess I wanted to -- or girls and guidance is probably the right order for that actually. I wanted to ask a couple of verticals question. So, Ita you had commented that cloud, you expect a meaningful decline. And I don't know if you could give us any more feeling for what you mean by that? We were thinking at low double-digit decline this year. But I don't know if that sounds like more than that? And then the other, on the positive side of this equation, the service provider commentary you said sluggish, we were thinking that would be declining this year, but it almost \u2013 I just want to clarify, do you think that that -- are you expecting a little bit of growth there or stabilization there kind of flattish revenue there? And then a bigger picture question Jayshree is, have you guys considered disclosing these verticals or some subset of them? Is that something we could maybe look forward to at some point in the future at least on an annual basis so we can all track kind of what's happening under the covers in the verticals? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Rod I'll try and answer as many of your questions. Your last one, first. So the answer is, we try to do our best by ranking them. And I guess you're looking for more granularity. So we'll definitely take it under advisement like we do anything you suggest and maybe that's a data point for Analyst Day. And going back to your cloud decline and service provider, flat to down, I think definitely means flat to double-digit down. We don't exactly know how much now because we're in the first quarter. I think Anshul and the team will get much more visibility in -- maybe Analyst Day or second half because that's when we really get a good sense. But Q1 is such a seasonal quarter. We don't have enough data. It's more an extension of Q4. So ask us this question again in May or June. And I think we\u2019d have a lot more to say. Service providers, yes I think when Ita actually explains the definition of sluggish to images, it's not that bad. And I think the worst was last year. So it's bottomed out and it can only get slightly better is our feeling. But we're not like holding of breadth or anything, but we believe it can't get worse. Rod Hall : But sluggish, would it be some range around 0 then Jayshree\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : 0 plus or minus yeah, not minus\u2026 Ita Brennan : Not declining further\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Above 0. Ita Brennan : Our hope, right? I mean it did decline a fair amount in 2019. And we'd like to think that it starts to cover a little bit from there, but sluggish kind of implied slowly. Rod Hall : Okay. So that's better than I thought. So I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open. Q \u2013 John Marchetti : Thanks very much. Just \u2013 Jayshree as I just -- as we're getting closer to this -- reaching the end of the sort of first $100 million on the campus side and you've added a couple of pieces there. I'm just curious as we look out the next couple of years, how maybe we should think about that business trending up towards a little bit more of a meaningful contribution to the overall growth rate? And then Ita just real quick on the tax rate, I just wanted to make sure that I heard it correctly that at least starting in 2020, we should expect this lower rate to continue and that it may tick back up over time, but that we're at least expecting that lower tax rate to continue over the near term? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes let me take the tax one first maybe. So the Q4 tax rate of 15%. I mean that's a one-off, right? It's some very specific reserves that were released in the period. As we go forward, we've been thinking about the structural tax rate somewhere around 21%. That's what we guided for Q1. There's probably more upward pressure than downward pressure on that over time. So I think 21%, 21.5% it's is in that range somewhere. But I think for now you're in the 21% range for Q1. And then maybe you see a couple of basis -- tens of basis points kind of increase all time, but it's -- it will take time. That was more kind of a longer-term structural rate statement. The 21% plus or minus hasn't really changed in the current timeframe. Jayshree Ullal : And John to take your question on the campus. We think being a new kid in the block, when there's been a fairly mature market and a $10 billion term largely Cisco and maybe HP, Aruba just for us to enter in and be taken seriously is the first order of business. And I have to say the enthusiasm for Arista, the software, the cognitive cloud vision has been very well received. So, I think, delivering the first four quarters of $100 million will really establish a baseline for more growth. As I said at the last analyst meeting, I'd be very disappointed if we didn't have that more growth translate into doubling and doubling again. So I'm \u2013 my team would be looking to take that $100 million to $200 million and then to $400 million and then some. But more on Analyst Day maybe, on exactly how we do that in the details. Curtis McKee : Great. And callers, as a reminder, please keep one question per call and a follow up. Thank you very much. Operator, please move to the next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Thank you. Jayshree, you guys have prided yourself from day one on a single OS. Now with Big Switch you're going to have a second OS. So I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about the future of Big Switch's OS? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. No, that's a really good question. Yeah. We've actually done three acquisitions and had to deal with the OS twice before. So to -- before I answer your Big Switch question, let's take the other two. Metamako, very FPGA-centric, it was really for the high-frequency trading market, low latency. The OS did not play a big role and when it does it will be EOS, right? Mojo, really a radio management Wi-Fi. We immediately integrated into CloudVision. And again, the OS was less important than the CloudVision integration to bring wired and wireless together. Big switch, we fully expect that same CloudVision integration with Dan's and BMS the monitoring fabric, so the OS will be somewhat transparent and unification of inline DANs and a monitoring fabric will be much more important. The big cloud fabric is the unique product. And we believe the go-to-market channel there is not necessarily a typical Arista customer, who's looking for EOS and CloudVision. But a technology partner like Dell Technologies or Nutanix that wants to integrate this with their servers and storage. So very much like SoNiC or FBOS [ph] this is a converged infrastructure solution. Jason Ader : So is it right to think about that serving a part of the market that you probably never would have served and therefore you can reconcile it with the overall strategy? Jayshree Ullal : That's correct. Well, again, its early days and we're still learning. And both Doug Murray and Kyle, the co-founder, are teaching us as we speak. But if we look at there, over 300 customers, the overlap with our customers is only one-third. So 60%, 65% of the customers are new to us. Curtis McKee : Great. Thank you, Jason. Jason Ader : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Yun : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the 400 - your 400-gig opportunity. Can you talk about expected market share for 400 gigs, maybe just at a high level, especially versus your peers? I think it's fair to say that you're dominant in 100-gig at hyperscale clouds. But is the expectation to win the majority of 400-gig deals? Or are you taking a more conservative view, where your peers might see sizable in as well? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think, our peers should have seen sizable wins on 100-gig too, I don't know why they missed the boat. But it's very unnatural for an incumbent to lose a speed transition. So the fact that Arista became number one is just never been done in the networking industry before. Now what we see with 400-gig overall time line is, we have been consistent on that. We are seeing early trials, we expect mainstream deployments this year, particularly in the second half. And, obviously, the cloud will play a big role, but it will also be some of the high-end enterprises and service providers as well. And so given the trials we're seeing, we don't expect material revenue of 400-gig until the second half of this year and really 2021. And the other thing I'd point out is nobody just build 400-gig in isolation, it always happens in conjunction and they're always mixing and matching 100-gig and 400-gig. So Anshul do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Jayshree two comments here. Brian, I know everyone is focused on 400-gig, I do want to remind you and everyone else, 100-gig is actually growing in 2020. It's not going to just sit. There are many other accretions coming soon as well whether it's 8x50 going to 4x100 or 8x500 as well. It's not just a single transition that our customers are planning or going with us on the multiple three to three years generation roadmap, I don't mean discussed. Lastly, there is some dependency on the DCI or backbone networks on availability of the other optical scale and that's still expected to be second half maybe even end of the year. And hence any material deployments in that space will be in 2021. Jayshree Ullal : And Anshul just to reiterate your point, the TAM for 100-gig is $4.5 billion, I don't know the TAM for 400-gig will even hit a few hundred million this year? Anshul Sadana : Pilot is not a TAM. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Pilot is not a TAM, it's a pilot, okay, good one liner. Brian Yun : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Hi, Ittai. Ittai Kidron : Yes. Hi, ladies. Two questions for me. I know Curtis tries to limit me to one, but I'll try to sneak one in. Regarding the acquisition of Big Switch, I do want to understand the relationship with Dell and also if there\u2019s revenue concentration for Big Switch, if I remember correctly Microsoft is a big customer for DANZ. So, if you could discuss that? And then on Dell, Dell also have other companies they work within the space, Cumulus, if I remember correctly. Help me understand how do you think the nature of that relationship is going to look like going forward? Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question. First of all, we didn't see any significant revenue concentration and certainly not Microsoft. That could have been a past statistic, but not true now. So there's obviously some big customers and they have some top 10, but not specifically one that is a 10% concentration. So coming back to your question on how do we see this? So, we do see the partnership with Dell getting stronger. How Big Switch was selling was really software-only disaggregated from hardware and a lot of the hardware was Dell switches. We continue to plan to offer that model and strengthen our partnership with Dell and make that stronger. So we are not changing the sales motion and it complements what Arista is doing in the high-end enterprise and cloud titans very, very well. So no change. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ittai. Ittai Kidron : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Arvind [ph] dialing in for Amit. I also had a question about your campus switching business. It continues to do very well for you. But can you perhaps help us understand what the margin profile for this business looks like versus your broader portfolio? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. I would generally say the margin is about the same. But if you see versus our router portfolio as oppose to versus our\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Broader portfolio, sorry, not\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Okay. The broader\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Just broader. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Yeah, not at the same. More pricing pressure in the campus always because the market is defined that way, but the margins aren't significantly different. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Arvind. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open Ben Bollin : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back to 400-gig. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think the builds for 400-gig differ from what you saw in 100. And specifically, I'm interested in any thoughts you have on how your partners approach their own OS development efforts, any Switch standardization efforts. Just any high-level thoughts there? And then how do you think the margin opportunity for 400? How does that compare to what you saw with 100? Anshul Sadana : Ben in terms of the 400-gig architecture and how our largest customers are leading the way there, the entire architecture needs to contemplate a server flow, let's say 100-gig being able to go through the network. So you have to upgrade it end-to-end. You cannot just upgrade in silos and be done with it. So for large-scale architectures upgrading the backbone and the DCI networks is almost a necessary step one, before you can do 400-gig in the broader Leaf & Spine Design. And that depend on VR other optics and so on. And but that's where the testing is going on already in the lab trials that we are involved in today. For AI, which are closed clusters, 400-gig is already starting to see a little bit of deployment but these are still very small scale, simply a 32x400 gig type of design in our mini-leaf spine. And there we are working with our customers very well with co-development. It may not be just the OS that problem I think we've already exist with our best customers and partners, but actually co-development with the NIC and the FPGA and the GPU and so on that is also happening already. Operator : Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I had a question for you regarding Big Switch And just the operating margin drag that the Big Switch acquisition is going to create in 2020? And maybe I was hoping for some specifics on 2021 accretion that you mentioned is this a 1Q, 2Q 2021 accretion? Or is this a back half of 2021 accretion that you are anticipating? Jayshree Ullal : I'll answer the second question and then Ita if you could. I wouldn't call it too much of a drag but maybe but in terms of when it will be accretive, the forecast we have challenged the team with is to be accretive by the end of 2021. Obviously, I'd like to see it sooner. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think once we get out of Q1, Q1 was always going to be a quarter that was tight from an operating margin perspective because of where the revenue came in at and the mix of business that we have with cloud being heavier. So you are seeing a lower kind of operating margin in Q1. I think once we get out of Q1, we had talked on the last call about a 35% operating margin being kind of the target. And I think we can absorb Big Switch within that, right? As we move through the year. And then we'll have more to say kind of on the top line. On the next call once we sort out some of the purchase accounting and other stuff that we need to work through. Sami Badri : Got it. And just actually a clarification. Is the $100 million run rate for campus? Does that include any Big Switch contribution? Or is that just the stuff ex-Big Switch? Jayshree Ullal : No. Big Switch was not there in December 2019, right? So I was talking about Q3 and Q4 we're well on our way to $100 million. And I just want to clarify it's not run rate, it's revenue. So real revenue. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Sami. Operator : Your next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Your line is open. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. It looks like Microsoft was only down 5% in 2019, a bit better than what you were expecting. Given that in the past you provided early color on what Microsoft could be as a percentage of revenue. I was hoping Jayshree you could do that for 2020. And then secondly\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Nice try Tejas, but I'd be a fool to do that right now. You wouldn't you say after the surprises we had last year. I'm teasing you. Tejas Venkatesh : Well this one with better. But the second thing, I wanted to ask about was is Tier 2 cloud now less than 10% of revenue and is the visibility sort of improving, given that it was such a drag in 2019? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : So that's a good question Tejas. None of our 5 verticals that I report are less than 10% revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. I kind of want to build on that last kind of question, as you look forward I think last quarter you alluded to that one of your large cloud titan customers were actually just flat out pausing with regard to their spending dynamic as it relates to maybe a server cycle of variable kind of consideration. As you think about your outlook today, how would you characterize -- if whether or not that's changed at all? Has the slowdown become more pervasive across your cloud titan customers? Just any kind of update on how you kind of roll up that cloud titan forecast this year relative to what you thought coming out of last quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Yes that's a good question Aaron. So first of all, just to reiterate all the surprises we received from that specific cloud titan remain and are being factored into the 2020 forecast. So those numbers will be lower this year right? As for the other cloud titans each one is unique. So it's not necessarily feeding into the others. So that is specific to that one. And each one has their architecture, their timelines, their migrations, their specific CapEx plans. So I wouldn't roll one into the other. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Right. Just I've got a similar question but from a different angle with respect to cloud. So we went back several quarters ago you spoke about dramatic pause. And I think you also mentioned the fact that it wasn't just a question of when they would return, but to what magnitude when it did. So the question I now have for you is, I assume by definition your visibility for Microsoft and Facebook is not what it was at its peak far from it. But what visibility -- how would you characterize that visibility today and looking downstream not just the next quarter or two but further out. Do you have any visibility as to what those customers will look like a year from now and that's speaking about a quarterly period. But obviously speaking from an annual standpoint what\u2019s the contributions of it? Jayshree Ullal : Hi Paul. So if you go back consistently to our last three years, I think we've always said, we don't have more than one to two quarter visibility on any of our cloud titans and that hasn't changed. So I wouldn't be able to give you annual visibility of what they spent this year versus next year would be. I do think we get greater visibility in the second half of this year on how the next year will look like. But in terms of broad trends -- but that answer hasn't changed, despite the pause and puts and takes. Anshul Sadana : If I can add? We don't have visibility into their surprises. Paul Silverstein : Fair enough. Guys on the enterprise just very quickly, Jayshree you kept referencing the one million plus deals. You said it's almost doubled over the past three years. Can you tell us how many million-dollar deals you have in enterprise? Jayshree Ullal : Hundred, many hundreds. Paul Silverstein : It can't be many hundreds, because you\u2019ll be well beyond your $100 million target. I'm talking about campus specifically. Jayshree Ullal : Oh, you're only talking about campus. Oh, I see. I don't have that answer, but I was talking about overall enterprise including campus. Paul Silverstein : Okay. But you don\u2019t have\u2026 Curtis McKee : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thanks very much. We have been hearing from some of the larger OEMs that the server chipset availability is a little tighter than they might have hoped. I wouldn't necessarily sound that there would be an implication for Arista a year ago. But given the tenor of the conversation we had last quarter, I'm wondering if that is something that we should be monitoring just in case some of your other web scale customers can't get all the servers they want or some of the Tier 2 players can't get the servers they want and that may then impinge upon your switch sales to them. Anshul Sadana : So just -- it doesn't really impact us as much on our short-term variation over there, especially the cloud companies they decouple supply chain planning for these issues and have one or two months of gas anyway. If it's a fluctuation of one or two months, it doesn't really impact us. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thanks, Anshul. And then as a clarification, I think in the past you've talked about the likelihood of coming back to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020m is that still a reasonable place for us to stick a yard mark? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, Jeff that's our hope. We hope for that. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Thanks. I just want to clarify the comment about the sluggishness for cloud service provider and service provider. That sluggish comment Jayshree that was for both verticals? Jayshree Ullal : Yes combined. Alex Kurtz : Okay. Combined. Okay, thank you. Jayshree last quarter, you outlined changes in how you thought the cloud service provider segment was considering on-prem versus on-prem infrastructure spend and maybe some of them moving back to cloud. Can you just give us an update on how you see that vertical? I know you outlined it here in the growth projection, but that was a change from prior views. So I was just wondering if there's any update on that segment specifically. Jayshree Ullal : That\u2019s correct. Nothing's changed significantly, although some of the Tier 2 cloud providers have resumed some small spend and some of them are still evaluating. Alex Kurtz : All right. Okay. So longer -- you don't see it as a near-term secular opportunity right now from what you can see. Ita Brennan : No not in the first half. I think there's less -- not a drag. I mean\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Not a drag, but not an amazing upside either. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I have two questions. First, if I remove Facebook, which -- sorry Amazon -- sorry Microsoft, which I have perfect numbers. Jayshree Ullal : I am confused\u2026 Tal Liani : Eventually I'm going to get to the right answer. Yeah. So if I remove Microsoft, which I have perfect numbers for both years. And then I assume Facebook at 9% last year because that's the highest number below 10%, versus what's this year, the growth is only 6%. If I assume for Facebook 5% and which, again, it wasn't a 10% customer. So it has to be below that. So if I assume anything below, the growth is even lower than 6%. So the question is, why aren't you growing faster with everyone else, forget Facebook and Microsoft, why don't we see faster growth like we used to do? Because we've always been doing this exercise without Microsoft and growth was always very strong. And the second question not related\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Hold that. Can you hold -- we're still processing your first question, because we're still trying to understand how you computed this. Did you compute deferred revenue in your question? Tal Liani : No, I did not. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Ita Brennan : The issue, going from 2019 to 2020 is that, you have this deferred revenue, $118 million, which is like 5% of revenue effectively, right? So -- right, that you have to backfill effectively in 2020, right? So that kind of -- that's a drag on the growth rate before you start, right? So you have to adjust for that. But even with that when we say there's -- that cloud vertical will be kind of flat to down from a demand perspective, right? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Tal Liani : But the deferred -- by the way, is the deferred related to Microsoft or Facebook or the deferred related to everyone else? Ita Brennan : If you trace back in time, it was non-Microsoft and obviously it's a large number. It's -- I think you can figure out that it's a Facebook impact, right? And we talked about that as a 16% -- from 16.6% with the deferred probably 12% revenue without the deferred, right? Tal Liani : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold -- sorry. Jayshree Ullal : No, it's fine. Curtis McKee : All right. Fine. Tal Liani : I had -- Curtis McKee : Hey, Tal, we'll Jayshree Ullal : Tal, we\u2019ll come back to you if we have time. Curtis McKee : Yes. Tal Liani : Okay. Perfect. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. I got confused not only from Tal's question there. Anyway, I wanted to ask you about the commentary several of the hyperscale providers made about extending the useful lives of their servers. Wondering how that translates into your business for intra data center switching. And if this was an aspect that you were aware of when you had provided your forecast last quarter or whether the commentary we heard during this earnings season was also new to you. Thank you. Anshul Sadana : No, Simon, when we did our earnings call last quarter we very much stated what we have seen from at least one of the cloud titans, where they were delaying the refresh and now you've seen a market that some of the other cloud customers are doing this as well. But we're not seeing this with the other Arista customers so far, even in the cloud space. So for us it's limited to one customer. We don't deal with the other large cloud company you're referring to as much, so we're not as exposed there. But it's not a market-wide trend. It's very specific to that architecture, the next-generation they're on and the sort of type of offloads they're looking for to decide with the generation to select. Simon Leopold : And is there a way or some math to figure out how to translate, if, say, they extend the life by one year. So instead of three-year replacement they get a four-year. Is there some arithmetic or rule of thumb to help us think about how to quantify the impact for you? Anshul Sadana : We don't have it. I'm quite sure someone on this call has models around that. But no, that's not something we try to focus. Simon Leopold : Okay. Jayshree Ullal : Mostly a delay of a year in the spend. Anshul Sadana : All right. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thanks everyone. I sincerely just have one question because I'm just a very simple guy and not as smart as others. But whether it be Jayshree or Ita or Curtis, a quarter or two ago you talked about a cloud titan skipping a refresh cycle, are you elongating their purchasing. Some of the commentary after that was, well maybe they're using White Box or maybe they found a better compute standard or a way to fit more through compression or duplexing or some other standard. Now that we've had several months behind us, can you give us any visibility of -- do you feel more confident that it truly is just a delay? Or are they looking at other solutions? Or just kind of revisit that topic? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So Jim, I think all the theories of those answers are not true. I think the customer has been pretty straightforward with us. That they have always been using Arista, as well as some internal development and we've been working with them on the internal development. So we feel very comfortable that the forecast has changed and they continue to be an important partner with us. Jim Suva : Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of, given kind of your commentary on the slower spending you're seeing from your customers you obviously have a Q1 seasonality that's weaker than what we've seen historically. As we look through the rest of the year is it kind of fair to assume given the visibility you have right now that the seasonality through the remainder of the year will be weaker than what we saw kind of normal years like 2018 for example? And are you still kind of comfortable reiterating the full year, I think guide that you gave last time which was for a modest decline in revenues? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So Samik, I'm a little confused by your question. We did not give -- are you talking about cloud customers our customers are large? Samik Chatterjee : Cloud customers. Cloud customer. Jayshree Ullal : Cloud customers. Okay, okay. Now that makes sense. Yes, yes. So look we feel the same way as we did last time which is, we had a lot of weakness in the spending and it's reflected in our Q1. I think we will know better about the rest of the year when we get to the second half more, but as it stands nothing's changed. The CapEx that they will spend, Arista fields in a very strong position to compete, differentiate and get the business. So we're not losing market share. We're winning the sockets, but the rate of spend and adoption we do believe will be a flat to down year this year. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey team, happy, almost Valentine's Day. If you guys go over the linearity of the mix for customers over the course of the year and if it was back half loaded at all. And I just want to be clear is cloud titan going to be flat to -- flat to down double digits on top of the $118 million deferred headwind? Or is the flat to down double digits inclusive of the headwind? Ita Brennan : Right. So the meaningful revenue decline and the double-digit are all referencing revenue, right? So saying basically the revenue numbers will decline meaningfully, right? That includes $118 million, right? When we talked about demand and we said, that we expect it to be flat to down, that's not referencing that double-digit number, right? That's a commentary that obviously will play out as you see where it goes but it's not trying to say that it's a double-digit number. Jayshree Ullal : And then to answer your question on Q4 linearity. I'm just looking at the chart Mark Foss has given me. It was pretty linear across the three months. We had a record $1 million of customers in Q4. And good spend across our top 50 customers. So nothing unusual except more campus. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Hi, Tim. Tim are you there? Curtis McKee : Tim? Jayshree Ullal : Let\u2019s go to the next one. Curtis McKee : Tim call back. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Ryan Koontz : Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could speak to your outlook for international. Obviously, hyperscale has been a big piece of that shipping to their international destinations. But if you could speak to kind of any updates on strategy or channel development there that's going to supercharge that business for you? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Anshul and the team have invested pretty significantly in international, especially of course the developed countries in Europe and Asia Pac. We had a strong quarter. And we're starting to see some important customer wins in the enterprise and even some small service providers. We obviously, a much more channel led in international. That's always been the case. So that's been a strong area of experience for us. And I actually want to add to that. I think that's a strong area of growth really. Anshul Sadana : Both in headcount growth, we actually have a significant amount of heads added to international. And on the channel side, the channel development plan we have is a separate one for you. So a separate one for EMEA and APAC as well with a different ecosystem, different set of partners and so on. And that's coming along reasonably well. As Jayshree mentioned, the international locations are mostly fulfilled by channel but now we are working with them to make it channel led as well. So if you remove cloud and so on, the rest of the organic international business is doing well. Jayshree Ullal : And one other \u2013 just one quick add to what Anshul said, generally our customer logos are higher internationally than in the U.S., lower purchase of sale. But out of the 6300 cumulative customers has come internationally. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Okay. Sorry, sorry about that. I just wanted to ask\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Hey, Tim. Tim Long : Hi. How are you doing? I just wanted to ask kind of two related questions. First, could you talk a little bit \u2013 there's been a lot of chatter about silicon diversification in the switching area. So can you give us your views, obviously with a big customer making an announcement and starting to talk about some, some traction there. So what do you think the impact is there? And related what are you seeing just overall on white box these days? Are you seeing any change to who's using it or how they're using it? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Look, as you know Arista has always been a big component of merchant silicon and ASICs notwithstanding this new announcement have been around 30 years. It's not \u2013 ASICs by themselves are not new. We do see three dimensions. First of all is from a best-of-breed silicon standpoint, we couldn't be more pleased with our \u2013 the silicon we received from Broadcom both on the Trident, Tomahawk side and Jericho, we have very high confidence. It's a case where you can't just build one point product, you have to have a full roadmap and we've always been ahead of vendor specific at ASIC, and we believe that will continue. In terms of software, silicon by itself is not so interesting if you can't build a system. So, obviously, EOS, we feel is the most competitive software differentiated across many merchant silicon devices. I think it's -- we supported it over 18 silicon families, maybe more than that. And so in general we feel like that leaves only one other thing, which is Cisco selling chips. And obviously that's not our business. They're going to be competing with Intel and Broadcom on that one. Operator : Your last question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ita Brennan : Tal, you've got the last question. Tal Liani : By the way, I just want to comment something. We'll take it offline, but we shouldn't remove the deferred and I can explain it later why. The number is the number you could remove both sides. But in any case I wanted to ask about the gross margin, why is it declining sequentially next quarter? I don't think anyone asked this question. Ita Brennan : No. They didn't. Larger customer mix, right? We were heavy enterprise and financials in Q4 and we'll be -- we're heavier cloud mix in Q1. Q1 always has a heavier cloud mix because enterprise just takes time to ramp in the first quarter. Tal Liani : Got it. Ita Brennan : All right. Curtis McKee : Okay. Well, this concludes the Arista Q4 2019 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Please note that moving forward, our earnings calls will move to Tuesday, starting with Q1 2020 call, which will take place on Tuesday, May 5. Lastly, we have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on our Investor section of our website. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis McKee, Director of Corporate & Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Curtis McKee : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter ending March 31st, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks, potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions, and the impact of litigations, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. And with that, I will turn it call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. First, I would like to address the coronavirus global pandemic, the worlds largest in 100 year. Clearly, this is unlike recessionary events including the dotcom crash of 2001 or the financial recession of 2008, both of which were sector-specific. At Arista, we are focused on the welfare of our employees, supporting our customers, and helping the local community. We recognize our role and responsibility in supporting global communications and cloud infrastructure during these mission-critical times. We\u2019re adjusting to the new norm of real-time audio and video communication. Our support case load has doubled during the initial weeks, but has now stabilized as we help our customers in their time of need. Getting back to Q1 specifics, we delivered revenues of $523 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.02. Savis [ph] contributed approximately 21% of revenue, up from 19% last quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margins were 65.6%, influenced by the healthy software and services mix. We registered solid number of million dollar customers as a direct result of our enterprise traction. In Q1 2020, cloud titans was our largest vertical. The enterprise segment is now consistently the second largest, followed by the Tier 2 specialty cloud providers and financials tied for third place and the service provider at fourth place. Due to popular requests from our analyst friends, we are now providing more color into our annual trends across three main sectors, cloud titans, approximately 40% of our mix, enterprise, including financial services, approximately 35% of our mix, and providers, which includes both service provider and cloud specialty provider, approximately 25% of our mix. In terms of geographies, Q1 2020 mix had international contribution at 23%, with the Americas at 77%. In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we closed the acquisition of Big Switch Networks in February 2020. We are experiencing early traction and complementarity with Arista's data analyzer dense offering and entering into the network packet broker space. We are expanding in the campus, our cloud networking principles, introducing exciting cognitive WiFi suite of features with the support of Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams and Zoom, as well as open config based automation model. Arista's cognitive campus portfolio was launched last summer to address the explosion of clients, users and IoT devices with software-driven automation. We are well on our way to meeting our first year's $100 million target ending Q2 2020. While we are pleased with traction, we must all exercise patience as we cultivate this part of our business. It took us more than seven years to build our cloud business to $500, and we believe that our enterprise prospects will take time, especially in this COVID-19 era. We are only just beginning our first year of a five to seven year journey to disrupt 30 years of legacy and status quo. COVID-19 has required us to respond rapidly to changing events. In accordance with the country-specific shelters and orders, we have closed all our offices to assure employee healthy \u2013 health and safety. We are consequently experiencing supply chain constraints, and we are managing our global capacity with our contract manufacturers in San Jose, Mexico, Malaysia and coping with some inventory and component shortages. Lead times vary and have doubled recently for some of our popular products. Arista is working in lockstep with our customers in supporting their business continuity and planning throughout 2020. Our visibility, especially into second half 2020 is pretty low. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased sharply in April. Until, the economic environment permits us to resume more normal routine, we have limited visibility to demand. It is clear that, we live in uncertain times, and therefore, with what we know at this time, it is prudent to assume our annual 2020 revenue may decline versus our 2019. We expect to manage our overall business this year at Arista's 2018 levels, and we'll continue to monitor this closely. Arista, together with the entire business sector and global supply chain is scoping with multiple unknowns in the midst of a global pandemic. We expect to see some short-term strength in cloud titan, offset by prolonged sales cycles with new prospects in the campus and enterprise sector. We remain confident that the combination of our product superiority, commitment to quality with the lowest critical vulnerabilities and the highest Net Promoter Score of 76 is very compelling in the network industry and of great value to our customers. Our recent market share gains, customer intimacy and operating leverage will navigate us through these unforeseen circumstances. We expect to emerge stronger than many of our industry peers as we migrate to modern networking. Before I turn it over to Ita for financial specifics, on behalf of Arista, I truly wish all of our listeners, employees and their families, customers and well wishers be safe and healthy. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree. And good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2020 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash, stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were $523 million, down 12% year-over-year and just above the lower end of our guidance of $522 million to $532 million. As discussed previously, this decline on a year-over-year basis was in part related to the recognition of approximately $83 million of deferred revenue in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, while demand in Q1 2020 was reasonably healthy, we did experience some COVID-19-related components supply and manufacturing challenges, which resulted in extended lead times and somewhat constrained shipments for the quarter. Service revenues represented approximately 21% of total revenue, up from 19% last quarter, reflecting strong service renewal activity in the period, coupled with a lower product revenue number. International revenues for the quarter came in at $122.4 million, a 23.5% of total revenue, down from 25% in Q4. Shifts in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis were largely driven by the level of revenue and the location of deployments by our cloud titan customers. Overall, gross margin in Q1 was 65.6%, well above our guidance of approximately 63% and up from 65.2% last quarter. As expected, we saw strength in our cloud business in the period with the related lower gross margin impact, more than offset by some one-time constrained supply-related sales of previously reserved inventory and a healthy mix of software and services mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $149.3 million or 28.5% of revenue, down from last quarter to $154.3 million. R&D spending came in at $91 million or 17.4% of revenue, down from $96.2 million last quarter. This decline largely reflected lower engineering and prototype costs in the period. Sales and marketing expenses was consistent with last quarter at approximately $46 million or 8.8% of revenue, with increased headcount costs, somewhat offset by lower marketing and travel-related spending. Our G&A costs were flat to last quarter at approximately $12 million or 2.3% of revenue. Our operating income for the quarter was $194 million or 37.1% of revenue. Other income expense for the quarter was a favorable $12.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.6%. This resulted net income for the quarter of $161.7 million or 30.9% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.94 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.02, down 12.6% from the prior year. We completed the purchase accounting for Big Switch acquisition in the period, with immaterial amounts of revenue and expense included in our non-GAAP results in the first quarter. For those of you focused on our GAAP results, we recorded $11.9 million of acquisition-related expenses in the period, which we consider to be one-time in nature, and which together with $4.9 million of amortization of acquired intangibles, have been excluded from our non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in our earnings release. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.6 billion. We repurchased $228 million of our common stock during the quarter at a weighted average price of $189 per share. This brings our total repurchases to date to $494 million or 2.4 million shares over a four-quarter period. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a three-year $1 billion stock repurchase program commencing in Q2 2019. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically and is funded from operating cash flows, generated $195 million of cash from operations in the first quarter, reflecting solid net income performance and a slight increase in working capital requirements. DSOs came in at 61 days, down from 65 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2.5 times, down from 2.9 last quarter. Inventory increased to $262 million in the quarter, up from $244 million in the prior period. Our total deferred revenue balance was $597 million, up from $575 million in Q4. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services related. Accounts payable days were 43 days, down from 44 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $3.1 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. As Jayshree mentioned, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 around the world. We, our customers, and our supply chain partners continue to operate under various local restrictions, and it is unclear when and how these restrictions will be lifted. While we\u2019re not in a position to predict these outcomes and provide longer-term guidance, we did want to provide some color on how we are managing and framing the business in the interim. While we expect demand from our cloud businesses to remain stable, we believe a number of other verticals could see some pause or slowing of IT spending pending clarity on the economic outlook. Given this uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to manage our investments carefully and manage our investments carefully and in a range closer to 2018 levels. We are prioritizing key projects and customer engagements, while benefiting from a natural reduction in travel, marketing, and other variable expenses. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix being the key driver. Now, for a couple of additional housekeeping items. We have continued to see some upward pressure on the effective tax rate and have increased the forecasted rate to 21.8%. In addition, we expect the current lower interest rate environment to negatively impact our other income amounts in the future. Finally, our guidance for Q2 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows; revenues of approximately $520 million to $540 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margins of approximately 35%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.8% with diluted shares of approximately 79.7 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I\u2019d like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question if possible. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, please take it away. Operator : We will now being the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Jayshree, mentioned the short-term benefit you are expecting from some of the cloud companies. So maybe if you can elaborate on that a bit, how much of this is the cloud titans. What are you seeing from the specialty cloud providers? Are you expecting similar upside there? And why isn't - why isn't there more confidence in the sustainability of this kind of upside as we look a bit more longer term? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Thanks, Samik. Well, as you know, Arista's cloud titan performance is consistent with the cloud CapEx reporting. In other words, some are experiencing strong spend, some are declining and others are cautious. So, given all the pluses and minuses, I think it's safe to say that for the year, we expect a flattish cloud titan spread. And this is actually an improvement because we've been saying flat to down. So of course, we\u2019ll monitor this closely. As you know, we never have long-term visibility on cloud titans. It's quarter-by-quarter. So we'll inspect more closely, especially for the second half. Now in terms of the cloud specialty providers, they were actually stronger trend for us in Q1. It's pretty cyclical in nature. It depends on different tier 2 cloud providers. Each 1 has a unique architecture. We had a somewhat weak specialty cloud providers in 2019, but they\u2019ve started off well for us in Q1 and Q2. And over time, it will be a matter of economics and what makes most business sense for them. I believe some of them will succeed in specialized use cases. But once again, we're going to keep a watch and monitor this closely in the second half. Samik Chatterjee : All right. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the enterprise vertical and maybe on two different vectors, if you can just kind of give us a little color on what you're seeing on large enterprises. And then as it relates to -- you talked about a longer process for the campus move. Could you just talk a little bit about the moving parts near-term given that, obviously, a lot of people are working from home? So it's difficult to sell on-prem equipment. So if you could just give us a little more color there. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Sure, Tim. So to answer your broad question on enterprise sector, I think Arista's brand is very well recognized for data center. And with our 6,000-plus customers, we've got very good recognition there from a differentiated product. And we've already been very engaged with them. So, customers we\u2019ve been engaged with, in fact, we had most recently in February, just a little before all the doors got shut down on us, we were engaged with over 100, 150 enterprise customers. And we had a global advisory and Arista innovate. So our intimacy with enterprise customers is very high, and we continue to do well with them with both existing and new projects. I think where we will be challenged in the enterprise and also in the campus is new prospects. We're not going to get enough face time with them. We're doing a lot of virtual webinars, virtual events, virtual ebCs, it's a virtual world we're certainly living in. But the level of contact for both, product capability conversation, relationship, partnership and in fact, even testing, for both new prospects and enterprise and campus will be challenging. And nobody is in the building to upgrade their campus either. So this COVID-19 will definitely delay our enterprise cycles for new prospects, but it should be okay for new projects with familiar customers. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yeah. Thanks. And well everyone is stay healthy. I just wanted to follow-up, Jayshree, on your commentary from the beginning of the call you said, you're planning to run the business versus 2018 levels. I assume that's an OpEx comment? Or is it an OpEx comment that also maybe relates to where you think revenue could kind of tends to allow, at the end of the year? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. No, Alex, first of all, I think we have - we understand the first half better than the second half. So, please take this with a grain of unknown and uncertainty in everything. And I know CEOs are supposed to know everything, but I can honestly tell you, we don't know much about the second half. So, what we\u2019re doing is controlling what we can control. And what Ita and I can control is the business and the expense more than the top line, for the year. And Ita, you want to add more to that? Ita Brennan : Yeah. I mean, I think, Alex, it's a focus on just OpEx and investment levels, until we understand better kind of what the rest of the year. How the rest of the year plays out, right? And so, you should expect to see us kind of cut back on some of the variable expenses, et cetera, and come back to spending that looks similar to where we were for 2018. And then, as things unfold, we can change that, right? But for now, that's the focus. Jayshree Ullal : And Ita and I want to reiterate something, we will absolutely continue peddle metal invest in key R&D and customer support. We will reduce marketing travel, obviously, since we can't travel and perhaps some IT spending. And so we work on what we can control and manage the business. And if it improves, we'll certainly recalibrate and invest more. Alex Kurtz : I appreciate that. And Ita, just on the 40% comment, on cloud titan mix year-to-date. Obviously, it would be helpful to have the year-over-year comp, if you're willing to give that. Ita Brennan : Yeah. I think in the investor deck, we've put some trends around what the split has been. And how it's looked and we put a range in there for kind of how it played out during the year right during the past year, right? So the investor deck is looking at a past year, trend over the prior year. And then, Jayshree's commentary is more short-term. So I think that gives you a range to work with. Jayshree Ullal : And it is a special slide for you guys, slide 15, I think it is good as, that's right? It\u2019s a similar manner. Alex Kurtz : Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yeah. Hi. Just really two quick ones, I promise are going to be very quick. Number one, is it correct that cloud outperformed in Q1 versus expectations in enterprise underperformed? And then secondly, Jayshree, can you comment on your campus time line of the $100 million? Is that pushed out now? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Jason, I think both cloud and enterprise performed as we expected, in Q1. We -- if there was a theme in Q1, which becomes a stronger theme in Q2, I would say, supply constraints in supply chain. Our verticals were pretty normal as expected. In terms of campus timelines, we are on target. We are committed to $100 million revenue in the first four quarters that ends Q2 2020. No change there. But we do expect that the acceleration, I would personally like to see beyond that in the second and third year, we now have to wait and see due to COVID. Jason Ader : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Next from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hello, ladies. Congrats, and I must say you're very brave to offer our second quarter guidance. So I hope it works out. Let me see. A couple of questions for me. First of all, on the supply chain, can you tell us how much revenues spilled over from 1Q into 2Q because of that? So we can understand the true run rate of your business? In 2Q, and again, going back to Alex's question on the 2018 investment levels? Ita just to fine-tune this, does that mean total OpEx 2020 equals total OpEx in 2018? Or is this a run rate comment? I just want to make sure, I appropriately capture that modeling wise. Ita Brennan : Yeah. I mean, I think as we sit here today, we would say we're managing it to an overall plus or minus 2018 total OpEx number, right? And again, obviously, as we know more, Ittai, as we go through the year, we will continue to address that further. But for now, that's how we're seeing it. Ittai Kidron : And as far as the push out? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. So to answer that question, Ittai, we did our best in Q1, but we got supply-constrained in March. I think we will be really supply-constrained in Q2. So I do think Q2 is a case of less about demand and more about supply-constrained. Ittai Kidron : Thank you, Jayshree. Thank you, Ita. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Appreciate the opportunity. I wanted to sort of visit the question or comment you made regarding the COVID crisis, making it more challenging to sell new products. I guess what I'm looking for is a better understanding of how much of your business comes from new customers/new products, and I certainly appreciate you\u2019ve got 400-gig products in the pipeline, campus in the pipeline. But I guess, what I'm struggling with is the sense that a lot of the campus was targeting comes So just trying to understand that comment and how to quantify how that fits into the overall guidance? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Thanks, Simon. First of all, it's important to understand that our $100 million campus target is $100 million. Its small compared to our overall business. We do believe that we can naturally go into our existing customers, who already know EOS and CloudVision. But as I said last year, we were pleasantly surprised by the new prospects and interest in campus. So in a non-COVID environment, I would have expected 60% existing customers and 40% new prospects. In the current environment, I think we're going to go back to a comfort level where our familiar customers are more likely to spend with us. And our new prospects will take time. So it will probably be 70%, maybe even higher on familiar and existing customers in 2020, which was not the trend we were on Q4 last year. Simon Leopold : And the implications for 400-gig has that split out as well? Jayshree Ullal : No. Okay. So I was answering your campus question. What was your question on 400-gig again? Simon Leopold : Well, I guess, broadly speaking, I think of new, including campus and 400-gig. So I just want to get a sense of how you see the timing of the 400-gig market, if that has slid out versus your prior expectation? And if so when? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So first of all, 400-gig, we believe, is truly for our high-end enterprises, semi providers cloud, and very, very high in enterprise, quite the opposite of campus. And as we said before, we expect early 400-gig trials will be in the late 2020 time frame. And actually, material production, general availability due to low cost, lack of cost-effective 400-gig optics and even some of the COVID issues will be in 2021. Nothing has really changed there, but we continue to see that. Now we did have some exciting product announcements. In 400-gig, we introduced the Arista OSFP line card, which is really a low power, a highly compact, plugable Arista OSFP form factor for simplifying DWDM for distances up to higher than 20 kilometers. We also demonstrated interoperability with Sienna with their most dense and spectrally efficient 400-gig and Arista Switch. So our 400-gig trials definitely are continuing with existing customers and cloud titans. But as we've always said, we expect - just to put this in context for you, in Q4, the number of 400-gig ports according to market researchers is 5,000 ports. However, the 100-gig ports was several millions, so there's 1,000x magnitude difference between the two. And I don't think that's going to change in the near term. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the questions. Jayshree Ullal : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could help us understand the nature of the demand change over the course of the quarter and into April, just so that we get a little better sense of how you were thinking about the second quarter developing? Is it going to end strongly? Or is it improving through the quarter, that type of thing? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So I think we have yet to experience the full impact of COVID-19, I think we'll see much more of that in the second half. So if I look at Q1, we experienced it at the tail end, mostly in terms of our supply chain. And if I look at Q2, we'll still be very supply chain constrained. So I think we understand Q1 and Q2 better, and both of them were -- Q1, as you know, is seasonally slow quarter for us. It really picks up theme in March, and we couldn't pick up enough theme, because we couldn't ship enough. And that theme is going to continue into Q2. So Q2 is all about shipments. We do see, as we said, good strength in the cloud titans, and we see reasonable demand in Q2, but I think our real worry is second half. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Are you able to share with us kind of a loose dollar range for how kind of a loose dollar range for how in either the first or the second quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think the first quarter is done, but you can tell, we projected lower than consensus. You can count all of that and more as supply chain that and more as supply chain related. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think, Jeff, if you look at where we came out for the first quarter on revenue versus our guidance, so that it gives you some idea of the magnitude of that, right? I'm not going to try to do that from Q2 at this stage. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. stage. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you both very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thank you. Operator : Your question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks a lot for taking the question. Kind of a different way of maybe asking the same question again. But I'm curious of how you think about the demand profile from the cloud guys. We're seeing industry reports talking about pretty healthy server demand at several of these public cloud vendors. We've seen the numbers from Microsoft and others. And what kind of the lag effect you see between server footprint deployments or expansion versus actually pulling more network bandwidth means and obviously, a benefit for Arista? Jayshree Ullal : First of all, we do see cloud titan use case demand in basically three areas. Either our customers are adding additional core or spine capability or they're expanding racks to increase their server density or in some cases, we're also seeing some geo expansion for their international needs. Although some of them have been ordered from the United States, increasing our U.S. titans contribution. So I think the use cases for us is very, very clear. What we also see is that because we have long lead times that Anshul and the team are working very closely on really understanding and sharpening their forecast and timing and working with us on scenarios and contingencies. So I think when they are starting to look at their 2020 deployments, they're not just looking at Q1, Q2, they try to give us visibility for the second half as well. And so while we have not factored any of that into our Q1 or Q2 forecast, we are seeing them doing some very prudent planning and for business continuity in their 2020 time frame. Aaron Rakers : And if I heard you \u2013 go ahead. Jayshree Ullal : Anshul, would you like to add some more to that? Anshul Sadana : No, absolutely. I know there's been a lot of commentary about other components that go into the cloud where there's compute, other pieces and so on. And it's hard to correlate one-for-one, especially in this time frame because some of the spike in those other components is coming because of shortages in previous quarters if you remember that. So as a result of that there might be some volatility and you will see some spike up on computers on. Networking has been stable. As Jayshree mentioned, we saw constraints towards the end of Q1 but prior to that things was stable. They were not short on networking gear and so on. I do wonder I had one last comment on the traffic needs. And there\u2019s a lot of commentary on the street and how traffic is growing and spiking up and work-from-home and so on. We have to keep those trends in mind relative to the overall cloud capacity. And yes, working from home, means may need videoconferencing or phone calls or edge connectivity. But that's a very small fraction of the overall cloud spend in the broader markets. So yes, sometimes traffic quadrupled or grow 7x in certain regions. But that's less than a 1% impact to the overall spend. So I would say there's some hyper on that rather than material impact to us. But as mentioned, things in the cloud are stable. And now we'll focus on second half with them. Aaron Rakers : And that's a great answer. It's a stable meaning. You expect the full year to be stable for cloud versus previously saying it would be meaningfully down? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Like we said, Aaron \u2013 Like we said, Aaron, we said, we expect the cloud to be flat year-over-year, flattish year-over-year. And then just to clarify before we get all wrapped on the revenue deferred thing again, when we're talking about the commentaries around the business and the trends of the business. And then obviously, we still have to deal with the deferred after that, right? But it is an improvement from \u2013 we had talked about the business being flat to down, and now we're saying we think it's stable in that context. And then the deferred is additive to that afterwards, right? Aaron Rakers : Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Aaron Ita Brennan : Thanks, Aaron Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Ryan Koontz : Great. Thanks. I asked about the service provider segment in somewhat of a laggard. And are there any kind of new strategies or products that you guys are rolling out? Or is there a different sales motion that you think going to invigorate that segment? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, thank you for that. We have been marching towards more and more product capability. In fact, we just introduced EOS software release 4.20.4, very targeted towards cloud grade routing and service provider paring use cases with a single EVPN control plane and segment routing and MPLs on the data plane, just a chalk full of features, BGP, flow aware, transport label, NPLS, segment routing, traffic engineering. What I can tell you is we're getting richer and richer in our product capability. But what I can also tell you is service providers take time to operationalize these things in their network. We are doing okay in our already existing service provider customers, and we are starting to win some small Tier 2 and Tier 3 ones, small ones, but too early to call and too early to say much more about it. Ryan Koontz : Great. Thanks, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ryan. Ita Brennan : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just discuss how the large enterprise accounts are getting impacted by COVID-19? Is it a sales execution issue where calling on the customer is the challenge or is it actually a personnel issue where they've got people staying at home and not in the data centers, deploying servers and switches? Or where is the disruption most impacting? Jayshree Ullal : So Eric, I would classify it in two ways. I think the large enterprises that are already intimate with Arista and need to make incremental enhancements. We're okay. They are familiar with us. They know how to work with us. We are supporting them. They are our systems engineering team, led by Ashwin, our Sales Team led by Chris Schmidt have tremendous amount of engagement with our existing customers, right? So I don't see a dramatic change yet in sales engagement or product differentiation. Where I do see difficulty is prospects. So we're having a tremendous amount -- we have been having a tremendous amount of new customer logos. And our new customer logos continue to be healthy and we gather steam, especially internationally, where we have 60% of our new customer logos come in. However, to convert them, especially into large deals and large enterprises requires large group of concepts. Number of network design clinics and obviously, were slowdown due the lack of face-to-face. So we're spending more time with them training, educating than we are able to do in deployment, whereas with our own existing familiar enterprise customers, we can march forward with more progress. Erik Suppiger : Okay. I think very helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe just one for me. You noted kind of strong behavior out of some of the Tier 2 clouds. But has there been any change and thought? Or is it just too early as the Tier 2s go forward, whether they will continue to kind of build their own data centers or leverage the public cloud more? Do you expect kind of the -  to have any change to that behavior? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Meta, that's a good question. And I said before, it depends on the Tier 2. We know some of the larger Tier 2s have paused, and it's not that they're going to the public cloud, but they're just pausing their spending. Others are expanding their data centers and some of the smaller ones are continuing for their specialized applications. So it's my belief that they will continue to succeed in their special use cases and complement the public cloud, but it will be cyclical. They didn't do much of it last year and I think some of them are coming back this year. And what we are seeing is the specialty clouds are realizing that some of the workload, they can control better and some belong in the public cloud. So I don't -- I think they'll continue to have a place. And in fact, a good example of that was content delivery network guide. We saw improved traction with the CD customers, and there's some real real-time streaming and content delivery, particularly with work from home with the millions of users and the aggregates of 4K and 8K flows, you can see why they would make some important investments there. Meta Marshall : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Your line is open. Pierre Ferragu : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. One more on cloud. So on this perspective that you'll have flat revenues between this year and last year, I was wondering how your mix is going to -- you see your mix evolving? And a couple of things I have in mind is, what you sell at the lower end of the hierarchy in access, server access at the lease level versus things you sell higher for DCI, for universal spine. And also - or maybe another way to look at the split would be Tomahawk based products versus based products versus Jericho-based product. Do you see a significant evolution in that mix between this year and last year? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Pierre. I would say in a short answer is no. We've always had a very nice mix of value products with the Tomahawk and Trident family connecting to servers. Sorry, the volume product and then the value products with the Jericho family with the 7,280 and 7,500 flagship, so depending on the use cases, customers opt for both. They're both very, very popular products, and both are currently challenges the lead times as well. It's not so much that we're seeing a change in product mix. I would say the biggest change we're seeing is people are doubling down on 100-gig and 400-gig is getting pushed out next year in the cloud. Pierre Ferragu : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open. John Marchetti : Thanks very much. Jayshree, I'm curious with the supply constraints that are going on right now, if it impacts any one of the verticals a little bit more than any of the others, or it's broad enough that it's kind of having an even impact across the group. And then Ita, just sort of as a follow-up to that, you sold a bit out of inventory, I'm guessing because you bit out of inventory I'm guessing because you couldn't bring some other stuff in. Is that something that likely occurs again here quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Maybe let me take that first. I mean that's kind of -- that's a onetime thing where -- when things are constrained, it's a good opportunity to go look at what you an inventory and sale some stuff that maybe we haven't thought we would. But I think we're through most of that now. So that's why I think the guide for gross margin comes back to the typical a 63% to 65%, and then it will just be driven more by customer mix than anything else, right. Ita Brennan : Yes. And John, to answer your question on our extended lead times, I'm not sure we saw a trend on verticals. What we did see is that our key customers worked very closely with Anshul and Chris and Ashwin to really sharpen their forecast and timing and work closely with us on their network designs and what products are available, what's not, when can we ship, what to them? And this is - I hope these are famous this last words, but I hope we can - John McCool and Christopher Schmidt and team are really working hard to overcome this. And should we improve this in Q3. I think we will have a chance to fulfil a lot our key customers\u2019 needs and factor that into their 2020 deployment considerations. But I didn't see anything by vertical. I saw it more by top customers. John Marchetti : Thank you. : Thanks John. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, John. Operator : Question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I was a little bit curious if you could give us a little bit more of maybe an idea on dynamics or just maybe some observations you've had in 1Q 2020, what's going on in Europe. And are you competing against different companies? Or are they offering different types of products, at least in the European region versus what Arista has to offer? And I know you've made comments that, a lot of your customers in the U.S. want to take you 1 also in Europe. But have you seen dynamics change, either pre or post COVID or anything going on in 2020 that you can shed light on as an observation? Jayshree Ullal : No, I think for Arista, because our presence internationally is somewhat new. We are feeling stronger in terms of our investment in sales and different countries. So country-by-country, we feel better about Europe now than we did, say, even a year or two ago. What I think is the difference between Europe and the United States is, they don't have the equivalent of cloud titans. And we haven't won major service provider titans. So we tend to have smaller wins, but many customers. And I think that's -- but country-by-country, the level of engagement, in fact, my -- our entire executive team was at a Europe customer session last -- was it last November? We were all there. It seems like forever, but it wasn't that long ago. And the level of intimacy that the team has developed with our customers especially in the developed countries Germany, U.K., France, Middle East, even Israel has been very strong. So I think the European customer base is embracing Arista for its differentiation and value add. But we just don't have the size of customers we do in the U.S. Sami Badri : Got it. And then just maybe competitors or competitors a little bit different in Europe? Or are you seeing similar competitors in both regions? Jayshree Ullal : That is similar, very similar we don't see the difference, at least not in Europe. In Asia we tend to see some but not in Europe. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Sami. Operator : Question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess perhaps you could you perhaps elaborate on what specifics [Technical Difficulty] Jayshree Ullal : Amit, we can't hear you. You're choppy. We lost you. You were dealing with - go ahead. Amit Daryanani : And if you did not have the supply chain issues or bottleneck what you are dealing with and if you did not have the supply chain issues in theory, what would the June quarter guide have looked like? Would it be towards the high end or something different? Jayshree Ullal : Well, it's difficult to speculate since we have supply chain issues. But -- and the reality is different than the theory. Ita Brennan : Yeah. Obviously, there are constraints, right? But I don't know that we concise those at this point, right? There's a lot of movement to better. Jayshree Ullal : That doesn't matter because we have constraint. Amit Daryanani : I was more trying to think guess, could this help you and maybe size how much it would help you in the back half of the year, when the supply chain bottlenecks alleviated and lead times normalize. But maybe another way, I guess, maybe if you could help us. Is there a gross margin impact you're dealing with because of the supply chain constraints? Is the way to quantify that in the first half of the year? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I mean, we saw a little bit of incremental spending in Q1, but it was very small. We will see some in Q2. But again, I think it's manageable at this stage, right? Again, I'd go back to the 63% to 65%, and we'll be - the midpoint of that range is a good place to start, and then we'll see how we go. So there is some incremental costs because you're prioritizing supply over some other things, but at least in the first half, we don't see something that's really significant. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Amit. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Thank you very much. Jayshree, I was hoping you could give us some insight into the way enterprise executives are thinking about conditions, what they're thinking about in terms of? How they're approaching spending? You made a comment that I think is probably accurate, which is you're more concerned about COVID in the back half. And I assume that\u2019s not supply chain related. It's more demand related. I would assume that you've done a lot of calls with top executives at firms. What are they saying to you about the business in process, the programs that are already in place are getting completed. But maybe the pipeline is falling off as you exit the second quarter and that there expectations for spending in the back half may be hard to put it any other way, sharply constrained? Jayshree Ullal : Right. So Alex, that's a good question. I think our enterprise decision-makers and key executives are struggling within once in 100-year phenomena, just the way we are, right? They all do have 2020 plans and deadlines. And they would very much like to work with Arista and overcome the supply constraints to meet them. And I believe they will. I believe they'll also take -- many of them will also take not just a 2020 horizon, but a multiyear horizon. And start thinking about how to plan for projects in this virtual world. So we do see some systematic prudent planning. And while we don't have visibility to that demand, we don't think demand will be challenged significantly if they plan prudently. Where we think demand will be challenged, like I said before, is new projects. People are familiar with Arista, people who have to do a lot more testing with Arista, people who love Arista, but haven't had a chance yet to get their hands on it. So that part of enterprise customers \u2013 may be more comfortable with doing nothing or being as is. But certainly, the 6,000-plus customers we engage with really, really want to work with us, and we'll continue to plan their projects this year or next year Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Can you hear me, Ita, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I can, Paul. Paul Silverstein : So as much as I\u2019d like to ask here again, for how much of the weakness is supply chain versus the demand. I want to say, it\u2019s a different question which is interestingly you have come up with \u2013 may be not try only this quarter, but I\u2019ve got sort of in terms of the classic question risk displacement for the cloud titans that investment community worried for quite some time. And going to recognize its not currently just for day given the background in the current macroeconomic environment. But any change your \u2013 about to lay your position with the Microsoft in particular in [indiscernible] in general relative to that order concern. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, I will try and answer the question you are sounding very muffled, Paul. Maybe you're wearing a mask. But if I understood the question, what does the competitive landscape look like with cloud titans and I would just sort of generically say that our fundamental thesis is unchanged. We're not seeing major competitive issues or architectural shifts. In fact, if you look at the recently released market data from both Deloro and Creehan, it validates our number one spot in 100 gig. And for the third consecutive year, we are doing that, where we are the number one market share in 100 gig. And we continue to increase market share into the high teens for high-performance data center switching. So, we are pleased with our progress year after year, including 2019. Anshul, I'd like to call you to see if there's any specific titan issues you want to highlight. Anshul Sadana : No, Jayshree, and as we've said before, Paul, the level of sort of joint development, we continue to do with these customers including Microsoft, is still pretty intense. So, we're not overly worried. Yes, these are competitive environments that will continue to be so. But there's no major shift. Jayshree Ullal : Paul, this is a good time for me to highlight -- the work Anshul has been doing. As you know, we have a rich long history in open networking. And today, Arista just introduced a switch abstraction interface, working so that we can work with our best-of-breed platforms and an abstraction layer for cloud titans and who can now use Sonic on top of our Arista SAI. And this is another example of the close collaboration Anshul is mentioning. Paul Silverstein : And Jayshree, if I could just follow-up, I appreciate the market share comments. But obviously, mortgage share is the exactly booking phenomenon and so with respect to forward-looking and the risk of displacement, you all haven't seen or heard anything from those cloud sittings [ph] that would cause you incremental concern relative to where you've been historically? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. On 1 hand, we are always paranoid and concerns. That's our nature, and we should be that way, and we want to continue to deliver the best of the best. On the other hand, we have no particular concern or no change in concern or no radical shift in the competitive landscape. Ita Brennan : All right. Thank you, Paul. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could step back a little bit and tell us your thoughts, bigger picture about broader hyperscale investment. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm just I'm just interested how you think about these customers longer term. The framing for that near term, we're seeing these kind of material demand drivers, migration to Saas, adoption of cloud need for Elastic capacity addition and in the interim, not seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves. So I'm seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves. So I'm interested how you think about it longer term, what are the material drivers that kind of accelerate growth rates? Any specific factors that you think could be meaningful for an acceleration in the broader investment? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ben. Well, look, I think the greatest acceleration for Arista came when the cloud titans made a huge migration to a lease fine architecture and especially standardized on Arista's EOS for 100 gigabit universal spine. So - and then on top of that acceleration, a number of titans co-developed with us, our join development focus that allow them to scale those through distributed datacenters all over the region and all over the cloud. So I think the next acceleration comes from more used cases, with 400-gig and 100-gig with the possibility of extending the data centers and their server density and their storage capabilities. And I don't think that\u2019s necessarily this year but it could be in the next three years. So we will have to be a repeat or how we succeeded in 100-gig and 400-gig levels. Anshul, do you want to add something more to that? Anshul Sadana : Yes. Then the way to look at the cloud and I know the cloud titans they started with data centers with compute and storage. And then moved down to different types of apps and are continuing that journey. And the next phase of investment in this pace now view there will be more at the edge by edge I don't mean directly just edge computing, but think of thousands type of make me please so the telecompany I think continue to invest in that area. And then connect that back into the tenant space in their large data centers. And these networks of different kinds being built or will continue be built in the next few years. With different types of overlays and encryption and mapping from one tenant space to the other and so on. I think that's very significant, because in the longer picture, if you look at it five, 10 years from now, we will look back and say, wow, this is how the cloud companies re-stitched the Internet. And I think those are some of the most strategic projects in the next few years. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ashu. That's great. The DCI and routing use cases cannot be underestimated. And they truly redefine the Internet. Operator : Our next question comes from Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg. Your line is open. Woo Jin Ho : Great thanks for squeezing me in. A longer-term question as it relates to the enterprise. Has the nature of your conversations with your close enterprise customers changed at all? This may be a little bit premature. And the reason why I ask is, given that we're at a stay home, zero touch environment, one would have to think that the network automation, thesis should start playing out a little bit faster given that no can get to their networks anymore. How does that fit into customer conversations today? Do you think that will evolve? And especially given that you do have big switch that provides that enterprise -- hyperscale cloud-like environment to the enterprise that might be a positive to you guys in the long-term. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. No, Woo Jin, you really bring up a good point here. We tend to talk about data center and campus and all of these different use cases. But our customers are thinking more and more operationally. It's great to have a box. But how to ignite that box with the right operational capabilities is very, very important. And so when you look at it, you're absolutely right, day zero, day one, day two, zero touch automation, one click for the campus, data center, huge topic. The other one and this is why we bought Big Switch is not only are we igniting real-time streaming telemetry and cloud vision. But we're really extending that into the observability and network package relative space and we're very pleased with the sort of sum of data analyzer, cloud vision and now fix iCH to extend our dance monitoring fabric. So that trial or combination is going to be very important 50% energy so our enterprise conversations are going beyond that\u2019s complete platform to much more operational automation analytics, availability and in the future security and segmentation as well. Woo Jin Ho : So just follow-on on that, Are these conversations that you've been having that's been ongoing for quite some time now? Or does the -- I guess, the pandemics crisis accelerate that and potentially force customers to make a left turn and they're purchasing decisions or the architectural decisions causing purchasing delays? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think it's too early to say it's because of the pandemic. They were going on anyway, but I think the importance of them becomes greater if the pandemic continues longer. Right now, I think we're getting more hammered on supply chain, but if we overcome that, I think we'll get much more on automation and analytics. Last question. Operator : From Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Great. Again just a couple. One for you, Jayshree, and one for your, Ita. Jayshree, do you get a sense of -- if there was any business activity in the quarter that was just a pull-in from second half plans into the first half, given the effects of work from home that some customers so pressures that they had to respond to quickly and did it by pulling in budgets. And for you, Ita, on the 2018 OpEx comment, I understand T&E, you're clearly saving a lot of money there. But are there headcount reductions planned as well? Or this is just less marketing, less travel; you're not flying business anymore. How do I think about that? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I mean, I'll take that one first, maybe just -- yes. No, I think we are preserving kind of employee talent. That's probably our most important resource and we\u2019re definitely focused on doing that and reading. We\u2019re looking at other areas, other more variable expenses, onetime type expenses that we can manage hopefully, in a near-term window and preserve kind of employees and the talent base. Ita Brennan : And the short answer Ittai to your question is, we did not experienced pull-ins in Q1. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck, ladies. Ittai Kidron : All right. Thank you. Curtis McKee : Okay. This concludes the Arista Q1 2020 Earnings Call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today, and please be safe everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis McKee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Curtis McKee : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ending June 30, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigations, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. To start with, I would like to address the once in a 100-year coronavirus global pandemic and reiterate our commitment to employee safety and customer response. At Arista, we recognize our role and responsibility in supporting global communications and cloud infrastructure during these mission-critical times. We are adjusting to the new work from home norm and expect this will continue throughout 2020 until vaccines or therapeutics emerge. We are working closely with our supply chain and contract manufacturers to improve lead times and support our customers in their business continuity initiatives. Back to Q2 specifics, we delivered revenue of $540.6 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11. A-Care services and software support renewals completed approximately 22% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins were 64.7% influenced by software and services mix. We registered a record number of $1 million customers as a direct result of our enterprise vertical traction and continue to march towards our goal of 1 to 2 new customers a day in the second quarter. In Q2 2020, cloud tightness was the largest vertical. The enterprise is once again our second largest performer, followed by Tier 2 cloud service providers and financials tied for third space and service providers in fourth place. Our vertical mix in the second quarter was consistent with the prior trends that we have shared with you in May : cloud titans, approximately 40% of the mix; enterprises, including financial services approximately 35% of the mix; and providers, approximately 25% of the mix. In terms of geography, international contribution was 19% with the Americas at 81%. Regional EMEA traction was smaller than normal due to push-out of big customer decisions and reduced international cloud titan spend in the quarter. As we predicted, Arista\u2019s Cognitive Campus portfolio met its first year 100 million objective ending June 30, 2020. While we are pleased with the traction, we believe that our new enterprise prospects will take time, especially in this COVID era. We remain hopeful and optimistic to double in the next five to six quarters to $200 million, of course, depending on market conditions. In terms of new innovations, last week, Arista introduced the cloud EOS router for the edge, supporting dynamic part selection services across all major cloud providers. Some of the key features include AWS transit gateway integration for seamless, automated provisioning, elastic consumption of cloud EOS across the three main cloud providers, AWS, Azure and GCP, declarative provisioning of multi-cloud through Hashi Cox terraform; and a dashboard based on Arista\u2019s CloudVision for centralized visibility of enterprise and cloud resources. As we review 2020 at the midyear point, there are clearly macro issues outside our control. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased sharply in July. The economic recession is looming and trade wars are escalating. Despite this, Arista experienced a cloud titan recovery and enterprise strength in Q2 offset by extended sales cycles in the campus sector. We are also pleased with the recent leaders recognition in both Forrester\u2019s Wave for open programmable switches in business-wide SDN with the top score in strategy category and with Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for data center and cloud networking. Gartner designated us a Magic Quadrant leader for the sixth consecutive year. These statements truly validate Arista\u2019s premier status in networking. I believe we are well positioned in cloud networking for data center, routing, campus and new multi-cloud monitoring capabilities, enabling network migration from legacy to modern. In these unprecedented times, customers sneak our compelling advantages and we expect to emerge even stronger than many of our industry peers. We hope you are all being safe and well. I will now turn the call to our CFO, Ita Brennan, for financial details. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 2020 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $541 million, down 11% year-over-year, but at the upper end of our guidance are $520 million to $540 million. Approximately, 6% of this decline related to the recognition of $38 million of product deferred revenue in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, while overall demand in Q2 was reasonably healthy, we continue to experience some COVID-19 related supply challenges, resulting in extended lead time and somewhat constrained shipments for the quarter. Service revenues represented approximately 22% of total revenues, up slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenue for the quarter came in at $104.7 million or 19.4% of total revenues, down from 23% in the first quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis was largely due to the location of deployments by our cloud titan customers, we did see some push-out of larger opportunities in our in-region businesses also. Overall, gross margin in Q2 was 64.7% above the midpoint of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65% compared to last quarter at 65.6%. Operating expenses for the quarter were $144.1 million or 26.7% in revenue, down from last quarter at $149.3 million. R&D spending came in at $91.6 million or 17% of revenue consistent with last quarter. Sales and marketing expense was $41.9 million or 7.8% of revenues, down from $46 million last quarter, with lower marketing and travel-related spending. Our G&A costs come in at $10.6 million or 2% of revenue, down from last quarter of approximately $12 million. Our operating income for the quarter was $205.7 million, or 38.1% of revenues. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $8.3 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.9%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $167 million, or 30.9% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.11, down 13.5% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.8 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the second quarter. As a reminder, we have previously repurchased $494 million or 2.4 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 \u201819. We expect to continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining authorization. We generated $138 million of cash from operations in the second quarter, reflecting solid net income performance somewhat offset by incremental working capital investments. We expect to continue to strategically increase inventory levels through the end of the year as we look to improve lead times and help buffer against any future COVID-related supply chain disruptions. DSOs came in at 65 days, up from 61 days in Q1, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2.3x, down from 2.5x last quarter. Inventory increased to $327 million in the quarter, up from $262 million in the prior period. Our total deferred revenue balance was $578 million, down from $597 million in Q1. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services related. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Accounts payable days were 59 days, up from 43 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.1 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 around the world. Local operating restrictions remain in flux and it is unclear when and how these restrictions will finally be resolved. While we made good progress on supply chain and manufacturing during the quarter, we still have some work to do to slowly return to normal lead times. On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix being the key driver. We expect to recognize some incremental COVID related freight and supply chain costs in Q3 and Q4. With all other things being equal, we\u2019d bound gross margins closer to the midpoint of our range. On the spending side, we will continue to manage spending and investments carefully, prioritizing key projects and customer engagements, while benefiting from a natural COVID-related reduction in travel, marketing and related expenses. You should, however, expect to see us add investments back into the model as incremental revenue solidifies. Finally, our guidance for Q3 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact in our business and supply chain. This is however an inherently uncertain situation and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items, is as follows : revenues of approximately $570 million to $590 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9%, with diluted shares of approximately 79.6 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis? Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I would like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, please take it away. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with their revenue trends and just ask on the verticals whether you are seeing since we didn\u2019t see the seasonality on the quarter\u2019s last year, whether what you have seen here is normal or similar to what you observed last year in terms of the cloud and other verticals movement from Q1 to Q2? And then secondly, I wondered if you guys could comment on the supply impacts, I know that you have said there was or we calculated about $14 million of impact last quarter. Are those \u2013 as that will come back to you here and is there any further ongoing impact on revenues in the guidance from supply chain issues or are those mostly solved now? Jayshree Ullal : Hi, Rod. This is Jayshree. So in terms of seasonality, I think things got better in Q2 than this year from COVID in general. We obviously experienced a very strong come back from the cloud titans, but we also had strong traction on all the other four verticals as well. And they pretty much continued in a fairly linear fashion throughout the quarter. And in terms of manufacturing, we are still experiencing inventory issues. We have very long lead times, where we have improved \u2013 we are improving them, we look to improve them, but we don\u2019t expect it to be back to normal till probably Q4. Rod Hall : Okay. You are still getting a little bit of drag on revenues, Jayshree because of the supply chain, but maybe it sounds like maybe not as much as last quarter? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, we are improving from Q1 to Q2, we will improve again from Q2 to Q3, but we won\u2019t get back to normal till Q4. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Back on the supply chain, did it prevent you from shipping from upside \u2013 further upside in the quarter or were you able to \u2013 because I think you had indicated last quarter that you had inventory \u2013 sufficient inventory for the June quarter, did your supply chain prevents you from being able to make the shipments that you anticipated to make? Jayshree Ullal : Well, given the guide we gave, Erik, we were able to make our quarter, but if you are asking could we have made more? We could have made more if we had more inventory. Erik Suppiger : Okay, very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Erik. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk about the demand environment for the enterprise data center? I am not talking specifically about campus, but about data center. It seems like you had another good quarter there. Just a little bit of why you are winning there? What are some of the learnings Jayshree that you have had over the last several years selling into that market, because I know, it\u2019s a pretty competitive market with a major incumbent. So, just talk about your success there, environment and why you are winning? Jayshree Ullal : No, I think we are winning, because of really three reasons, quality and support. Customers are seeing us as being superior to our peers in every which way in that department. Our innovation is getting stronger and stronger. And then our market recognition both from industry analysts and our customers and customers tell other customers, so many of these enterprises were aware of us and are now starting to make real decisions on us both existing ones with greater land-and-expand opportunities as well as new ones. Sales cycles in the enterprises can be long. And so this is really work in progress that\u2019s been going on for several quarters that we are seeing materialize in Q2. This may sound obvious, but also another aspect of our enterprise\u2019s success is that the familiar customers are deepening their expansion with us for many more use cases. So not only are we winning new prospects, but we are also getting more land-and-expand opportunities. So, I think we have always pointed to the enterprise being our shining star and our brightest opportunity and now we are seeing that across the board in all the regions. Jason Ader : Okay, thanks. Ita Brennan : Okay. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. I just wanted to kind of get an update on how you thought COVID was changing, how Tier 2s were thinking about build versus leveraging public cloud just given the acceleration some of them might have seen due to kind of COVID or work from home? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I think, there is two ways to really look at Tier 2 cloud meter. Sometimes, they make investments and from a cost perspective, they can very much justify their investments as much more cost effective in the long run than going to the public cloud. But other times, they have a hybrid combination of also going to the public cloud to manage their cost structures. So you see a bit of both. It\u2019s very cyclical in nature. And it really depends on which Tier 2 cloud you are talking about. So, some start on their own cloud and continue to grow the workloads and we experienced some of that in Tier 2 and others slow down a little and we experienced some of that too throughout the year as we did have some delay decisions that we hope we can pick up in the second half of the year. I think a piece of Tier 2 cloud that\u2019s doing well for us is especially CDN. With the work from home, as you rightly mentioned, the aggregates of all that video bandwidth is starting to create investment. Not that the video itself is large, but all of all of the 4k and 8k flows that up to an aggregate bandwidth. Meta Marshall : Great, thank you. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Meta. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess Jayshree a question for you in the last couple of quarters. We have seen your revenue decline, 10% to 12%, year-over-year, while hyperscale CapEx has continued to go higher, and I totally realized hyperscale Capital is a lot more things than just Arista spend. But as we get into the back of this year, Expectations hyperscale CapEx will slow down someone and in that context should we be comfortable that Arista revenue decline starts to diminish and shrink as we exit the year or how do we think about that? Jayshree Ullal : Well, Amit first of all, you are absolutely right to say there is no one to one correlation between network CapEx and the massive cloud titan CapEx. But if you look at the cloud titan CapEx that was reported some are very high some are strong some are flattish some were down and so I think the Titans did experience a strongest spend overall, and that did affect our Q2. But as we said in the last call, and I want to reiterate, we originally thought we would be flat to down because of the strong CapEx, we now feel good about flattish, which is an improvement from down. So of course we\u2019ll monitor this in the second half. But we believe that the overall for the year will be flat for cloud titans. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Good evening guys. Jayshree relative to long standing concern among investors but you are getting kicked off to one extent or another, whether from internally developed/white box solutions or from third-party competitors like Cisco and Arista specifically obviously referring to cloud titans. Any insight you can share with us regarding your competitive position any changes for better or worse? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Paul, not changed for better or worse in the quarter as, Arista introduced the switch abstraction interface. So we continue to have a long history of commitment on Linux, SDK, containerized EOS, virtual. EOS, this ag EOS, SONiC support, FBOS support, O&L support, so we embrace white boxes and customers embrace Arista\u2019s blue boxes too. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree just to be clear, I\u2019m not just referring to decisions that impacted the quarter revenue, but decisions that might have been made that could impact the latter half of this year or next year for that matter? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe Anshul, if you are there, we can get you to give some color, but we don\u2019t see any change in second half go ahead, Anshul? Anshul Sadana : So, there is a lot of noise around this topic, and obviously created by parties that don\u2019t have much to lose. But look, we are engaged our judgments on multiple projects, including a lot of the roadmap for our customers. So it\u2019s not just a box they have to choose they have to build a network that scales for their business, and we are very heavily involved in their 2021 and 2022 architectures. So the high level message I would give is don\u2019t worry, we will be fine. Paul Silverstein : Anshul I apologise, but does that don\u2019t worry, notwithstanding share loss, you will be fine because there\u2019s so many projects you will grow notwithstanding others gaining some ground, or you saying that there will be incremental projects and you will not lose share? Jayshree Ullal : Well I think we can continue in detail, but I think the message you are getting is a fundamental thesis is unchanged. We are not seeing architectural shifts or competitive losses. In fact, recent data validates that we are number one spots for the third consecutive year on 100-gig. So and our share is increasing every quarter. Anshul Sadana : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Maybe if we just look even, longer term with 400-gig coming up yet we have a coronavirus pandemic that we are working through to and it is harder to meet and have teas and coffees with people and such. Any visibility you have on 400-gig coming, whether it be discussions, are they more fruitful taking longer testing labs, how should we think about that? Jayshree Ullal : Right. Thanks, Jim. Well, I think we have always told you 400-gig trials began at the end of last year, but as we said last quarter, we will be delayed from 2020 to some of them may go into 2021 due to all the things you mentioned COVID-related slowdown. You just can\u2019t deploy 400-gig over a virtual collaboration conference. You have to do new product qualification. You have to get the optics in. That said, we are very pleased with our progress in 400-gig and we are winning tens of customers. In fact, to-date, we won over 50 customers in 400-gig. So, we are pleased with the progress, but many of them are in trials and early deployment cycles. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I just want to go into the numbers a little bit, can you help us understand or appreciate the variables to gross margin? At 59.5% product gross margin, it looks like it's the lowest level we have seen. And I think, if my memory is correct, your mix between the verticals really didn't change sequentially. So, can you give some the impact that you are seeing on gross margin and how we think about product gross margin going forward? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I mean, I think there's, the biggest driver is still the customer mix, right but you are right, it wasn't that dislocated between Q1 and Q2. I think, if you look at the last quarter, we have talked a lot about, being able to sell some inventory that previous we thought we couldn't sell or we wouldn't sell and that has given us some pickups on the gross margin side. All of that type of stuff will flow through product margins not obviously not for the services. So, now as you think about this quarter, and honestly into Q3 and Q4, we have some implemented COVID costs that we are also covering around freight logistics, just supply chain costs of kind of prioritizing supply over, over cost structure, right. So, we are going to carry some, some burden of cost around those activities through the end of the year that will all show up in that product line, right. So, I think that will move around a bit even outside of the, just the normal kind of customer mix that we have been seeing shortly. Aaron Rakers : I guess just to be clear, there has been no change in pricing dynamics competitively in the market as you say. Ita Brennan : I mean, is always put some face on pricing, that\u2019s how the market was, but nothing out of the ordinary right, nothing anything new or different, right. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And just to clarify what he just said, we are experiencing COVID related greater cost structures, no changing competitive or pricing dynamics. Aaron Rakers : Perfect. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Ita Brennan : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. Jayshree, I appreciate you giving the guidance comment on the cloud titans. I was hoping you could clarify what baseline you are using when you talk about flat given that you had the significant revenue recognition last year, I guess the number we had been thinking you meant was a base of about $840 million in 2019, but I want to make sure I understand what you mean by flat what you are comparing it to? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, that\u2019s actually a great question, Simon. I was just simply computing year-over-year relative to the revenue we have given, but I didn\u2019t get into the color of deferred. Ita, you want to help me with that? Ita Brennan : Yes, as you know, that commentary, Simon, is very much around demand, right. So it\u2019s not adjusting how is the deferred. So, if you think about the cloud business year-over-year and you say, okay, it was the demand was flat, you still need to adjust out the $118 million of deferred on top of that, right. So, you will still see a decline on a revenue basis for cloud year-over-year even with the demand as Jayshree described being flat. Simon Leopold : Could you tell us what dollar value you are using just to keep our life simple? Ita Brennan : Off the top of my head, no, but if you take the percentages that we gave you roughly for the mix of the building this and then adjust the deferred you will get there, right. I mean, you know how much the difference is $118 million, what the spirit of the business was on a demand basis. So you can get there. We can pick it up afterwards if you want, but it's pretty straight forward. Simon Leopold : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho from Bloomberg. Your line is open. Woo Jin Ho : Alright, great. Thank you for taking my question. So it seems you may have a new competitor in the switching market, Nokia and it\u2019s not a competition question, more so of a market demand question. I am just curious if the telco providers have changed their purchasing or their thoughts on switching, because I know that\u2019s been a sore spot for you guys for quite some time now and one thing that 5G is finally coming into solution for switching business for you? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think \u2013 but, I think there is very few details on exactly what the product is, but Nokia, certainly a good service provider company. And I believe while their entry into the data center and the fifth player will be difficult, and it will be tough to compete, and I don\u2019t really see any 400-gig products available despite the marketing. We do think we have respect for them as a service provider, and especially combined with optical companies, they might find some used cases there. So I don\u2019t think we will see, like you rightly pointed out, I don\u2019t think we will see a direct competition with them, but they may find some use cases combining with optical. Woo Jin Ho : Well is there is there an opportunity for that telco data center to finally emerge when 5G starts rolling out or you guys? Jayshree Ullal : We, we are already seeing opportunity with a telco data center independent of 5G rolling out, but we certainly see that as a independent on Nokia. That\u2019s a very real use case that Arista today participates strongly in the service provider segment. Woo Jin Ho : Thank you. Anshul Sadana : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you very much, everyone. I was hoping to ask about the trajectory in cloud titans in traditionally of course, obviously, you all have been very smooth with growth in the cloud titan vertical in the last couple of years. It\u2019s been a little less. So I think many of us have been hoping that 2021 would be back to the smooth trajectory. And I am wondering if the push out in 400-gig differs that a little bit or we should be just a little careful about how we look at 2021 given that 400-gig might come no late in the first half, or even in the middle of the year, rather than at the top of the year? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jeff. I am going to say a few words and pass it to Anshul when you look at 400-gig, as I said, that\u2019s not one, you can buy over a cup of coffee. So there is intense level of testing and, proof of concept labs that go on. And while our cloud visibility and demand is much better understood for 2020 I think it, will still take time to make this migration and from 100 to 400-gig and different cloud titans are in different stages of that migration. There are certainly all in varying forms of files, but I think you are right to say some of them will get off to a good start in 2020 late 2021 and some of them will take longer. I think what I can confidently tell you is the combination of 100-gig and 400-gig is going to be the mainstream deployment for most of our customers. Anshul you want to add to that on the 400-gig? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely. Jayshree, you mentioned there is no real stall effect for 400 in the cloud, because the cloud needs to deploy capacity, they would buy whatever is available in the market and qualifies today, the market is going to bifurcate going from 100-gig into 200-gig, 400-gig and 2/400-gig in the next 1 to 2 years. And I think we will participate very well in all of these form factors. But again, the cloud is not waiting. They just build with whatever they have today. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Jayshree you mentioned you are seeing a strong comeback from the cloud earlier. And I am just wondering how you feeling ready to visibility in terms of getting back to more of a mid teens growth rate and spending from cloud customers that you had communicated at the 2019 Analyst Day and how does this set us up for 2021, where I think consensus seem to be largely embedding in a double-digit growth rate with the cloud? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Samik. I don\u2019t think I am ready to say we are going to grow double-digit or mid-teens on the cloud. Our numbers are so large. We will be happy to grow in the cloud period, right? I think our faster growth and traction is clearly coming from the enterprise, but the large numbers are clearly being contributed from the cloud. So time will tell, but there is too many variables to make a direct correlation for that in 2021. Ita Brennan : Yes. It\u2019s a little early to start trying to call a 2021 view just yet, with everything as all the uncertainty that there is right. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. Hopefully you can hear me okay. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, we can. Hi, Tal. Tal Liani : Hello. I am going back to lot of the questions that kind of danced around it. Last year if I look at Q1, Q2 and Q3, you grew year-over-year 26%, 17% and 16%, pretty nice growth and this quarter, yes, you beat the numbers, but year-over-year growth is double-digit decline. So, I am trying to understand the color of the numbers beneath the surface, meaning last quarter you provided us with the numbers for the cloud vertical and I was able to see what was the growth ex-cloud vertical. I am trying to do the same thing to see where is this strength, where is the weakness and get some color around it? So can you help us with two things, first is what\u2019s the growth with and without cloud, just so we understand the growth in the other verticals? And second, can you give us color on the profile of the cloud growth, meaning is this an existing customer that started to deploy new architectures, you mentioned in the past and because of that the demand is going up or is it just demand just after a decline you see kind of snap back in demand, etcetera. I am trying to see if there is any big trend behind the recovery in cloud? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, Tal, I don\u2019t think we are going to go kind of down to that level of detail. I think if you take kind of the year-over-year growth, you have about 6% of that that relates to the deferred revenue being recognized last year. You have a step down on Facebook, which I think we have talked about before, right. They were very active in the first half through Q3 actually last year and then we saw that step down in the fourth quarter, right. And we know they are running at a lower level, we have shared that previously through this year. So, those are kind of your big drivers on the cloud without us trying to get into different use cases and products and stuff, because we are not going to do that. But those are the key kind of drivers around the cloud. And then we have seen strength in some of the other verticals and Jayshree gave the mix of the verticals again this quarter, there was nothing that unusual in the mix versus \u2013 but the breakdown that we gave you on the last call in the quarter just gone in Q2, alright. So, enterprise continues to do well, continues to grow and, cloud was better than we had expected, but still when you look at it over the year, it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s not a breakout, it\u2019s solidly kind of flattish on a demand basis now versus being down when we thought coming into the year. Tal Liani : And any color \u2013 maybe my second question, any color about the growth in the cloud vertical? Ita Brennan : I think you can get there on the math, right. If you take out the deferred and you look at the growth on the \u2013 certainly on the revenue basis you can get there, right. We are saying for the year, we are saying the demand will be flattish for the year, right. So I am not sure there is much else that we can give you at this point. Tal Liani : What I was referring to was in the past, you noted that some of the declines were because customers were looking to deploy new types of servers and as a result they reduced spending. I am trying to understand whether there is any correlation between that part and between the growth in cloud, is it just a reversion to the mean, or is there any big trend beneath it and new architectures are deployed, etcetera and that's why demand is going up? Jayshree Ullal : So look, we have a number of use case expansion, Tal in 2020. And usually they come in multiple flavors either it\u2019s adding an additional spine layer, where they are building a super spine or regional spine. It could be expanding racks to increase their server density on the network IO. And these two especially or it could be \u2013 but they are building out new data centers. So, these are the three most popular use cases we see. And we definitely saw that this quarter and we expect to see more of that this year. Tal Liani : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Michael on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. As we enter the second half of the year and we start to get to the OpEx level for fiscal year \u201821, I guess how would you start to think about the timing of fiscal \u201821 leverage and the return to more normalized growth? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I mean, I don\u2019t know that you should expect us to drive a ton of leverage. I think we will \u2013 we talked about kind of reinvesting and bringing back some of the investments, that we talked about taking out last quarter as we see revenue and solidifying revenue growth solidify. So I think, the operating margin targets that we have out there in the long-term model is roughly the 35%, plus or minus we guided to 37% for Q3, so I don\u2019t know that we are looking to, drive operating margins that are much higher than that. So we will continue to invest for fortunate to see kind of top line growth. Unidentified Analyst : Great, Thanks Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey, ladies, congrats on the quarter. But I just want to understand where you mainly saw the traction on the campus side is specifically on the geos given what\u2019s going on lately in this environment because most of us are sitting at a campus anymore, and if I can just sneak in one related to this. Were there any push outs related to cloud titans? I just want to understand correctly. If the push outs were primarily just related to cloud titans internationally, is that the right way to think about it or was it something else? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, let me understand there. I get confused when there is more than one question. So let\u2019s start with the campus first. So your question was, how did we achieve our goals when nobody\u2019s in the office? Well, quite simply, when nobody\u2019s in the office is everybody\u2019s making planning decisions it\u2019s easier to install them in the office, because no one\u2019s there to interrupt with it. So what we found is that the engagements we have had with both existing customers and new prospects in 2019 really helped us achieve our first year goals through the first three years and there was very strong demand. And, I can\u2019t even point to a theme on verticals. It ranged all the way from mid market enterprise to some of our large customers who are familiar with us, who really influenced our decision to be in the campus. And one of the main reasons they want us in the campus is single EOS, high-quality, one cloud vision so, and then one ability to manage both your wired and WiFi. What was your question James on the cloud titans? James Fish : I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it correctly with the push out related. It sounded like you guys said it was related to cloud titans internationally, is that correct Jayshree Ullal : No, no, no what he tried to say, was our EMEA business was weak, because the cloud titans did not order in that country. So the European piece of our cloud titan was weak and there were some push outs of European customers that pushed out a Q2, which made that number weaker than normal. James Fish : Got it Thanks for the color Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Ryan Koontz : Great, thanks for the question. circle back to your campus opportunity there can you may be walk us through some of your, your channel strategy? How much is direct versus you\u2019re looking for a third party integrators and such to work with you? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Now that\u2019s a good question. Ryan. Our channel strategy is still in very early stages and evolving. In fact, if you do channel checks, I think most of you don\u2019t hear enough about Arista. So I would say a lot of our first year success was definitely due to our direct customers focus maybe as not as 80%. However we fulfilled through the channels and through our fulfilment through the channels is also 80%. But the impact of channels I think, will kick in more in the second and third year than it did the first and I got to give a shout out to Chris Smith, Ned Chapin and a number of folks who are working on a suite of channel for [indiscernible] extremely competitive all over the world. Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ryan. Operator, next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good evening everyone. Thank you. for taking the question Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you feel the increased mix of work from home employees across broader enterprise is likely to impact longer term investments in the campus from the enterprise customer and then also you mentioned a little bit about video service provider but I\u2019m interested if you think there is any corresponding impacts as more people are at home and that might be influencing service provider investments? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Ben, both are very good questions. I think it really depends on how long you think work from home is going to go on. And it\u2019s going to go on indefinitely. I think the campus investments will take longer. It will still happen. We were expecting to double every year and maybe we won\u2019t double every year, but we will attempt to double every 18 months to 2 years. So there is very much a campus requirement, whether you call it the headquarters campus or the regional offices or the branches and Arista\u2019s technology where we are able to unify wired and wireless in a single pane of glass is powerful. But I think we will see the decision-making take longer. So I still see the opportunity as vibrant, but the time being longer. In terms of video and service providers, again, it\u2019s a really good question. When you look at our Tier 2, both cloud providers and service providers, the ramp in video traffic by itself, because it\u2019s compressed workflows, aren\u2019t that great. But the aggregate bandwidth is definitely causing more investment in both Tier 2 cloud providers and service providers. It\u2019s a colo or peering point or a content provider. So, we are seeing that the work from home is creating an aggregate demand for bandwidth. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : [indiscernible]: Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter : Hi, thanks very much. I guess I was going to ask about, I guess some of the bigger picture drivers, you talked about 400-gig earlier, but Intel recently delayed their 7-nanometer program around CPUs, including server CPUs. And I guess I am wondering if that impacts the server refresh model that many big internet content providers were kind of following. How do you sort of think about that bigger picture? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, George. I think when it comes to building a network the philosophy many of the top enterprise and cloud clients take and Anshul alluded to this is build with what we have. So, we haven\u2019t seen any delays in putting the network together because of server depreciation cycles or product acquisition cycles. So, we don\u2019t think the Intel slip will have an immediate impact it could factor in, in 2021 or 2022, but right now, I think we don\u2019t see any impact of the 7-nanometer, because they need IO, they need IO independent of which CPU it is. So, we feel pretty good in the near term. George Notter : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jayshree Ullal : Hi, Sami. Sami Badri : Hey, sorry about that. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the international opportunity there. We have seen a couple of quarters of year-on-year decline and you talked about some push-outs. However, the European region \u2013 some of the other regions that are probably going through something very similar as the United States with more cloud application consumption and people working from home, etcetera. I just want to understand what is it about the other regions that are not seeing the same magnitude of demand for the same dynamics as the U.S. from an architecture perspective, from a product perspective, how Arista inserts into it? Could you just give us any color on what explains the decline versus some of the other regions that are holding up relatively well? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So I would say three things, Sami. I think first, we just got a late start on international investments and we still see \u2013 we are still looking to see that payoff country by country and each country has its dynamics. It\u2019s hard to lump Europe as one. The second is both quarters that you are referring to was influenced by the cloud titan and how they purchased. So, they just tended to purchase more in the United States than they did in in-country, in the region and that\u2019s affected it. And then the third thing I would say is in general, Chris Schmidt and Ashwin Kohli and Anshul and the whole team were having more and we are having greater enterprise traction in the U.S. and bigger bets in the U.S. and we want to see the same and we have every belief and hope that we will see the same, but it\u2019s taking a bit longer in the international locations. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Sami. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Sami. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vinod Srinivasaraghavan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Vinod Srinivasaraghavan : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about your outlook to the extent that you are embedding supply and demand headwinds, would you say that the headwinds are mostly say like 75%, 80% supply chain related or are you seeing you are expecting some demand weakness or slowdown in any vertical? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Vinod. That\u2019s a loaded question that I may not be able to answer to your satisfaction, but I would say at least as it pertains to Q2, demand was strong and I wish we could have shipped more. And I think we will run into a little bit of that in Q3 as well albeit it\u2019s a slow summer cycle. So, we don\u2019t yet know about next year or we don\u2019t know enough about Q4, but certainly Q2 \u2013Q1, Q2 were pressured by supply chain and the second half we hope to respond to that supply chain and create more demand. Vinod Srinivasaraghavan : Okay, thank you. And is there \u2013 what would you say \u2013 can you just give us a sense of your backlog, like how much of that has kind of been held up? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, no, we don\u2019t talk about backlog, but it\u2019s safe to say we have some. Vinod Srinivasaraghavan : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Vinod. Curtis McKee : So this concludes the Arista Q2 2020 earnings call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and everyone be safe. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista Web site following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis McKee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Curtis McKee : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our Web site. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer term financial outlook for the 2021 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, our product innovation and the benefits of recent acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. To start with, we all hope that you and your families are safe during the global pandemic. At Arista, we recognize our role and responsibility in supporting global communications and private infrastructure during these challenging times. We are working closely with our employees, supply chain, contract manufacturers, customers and Arista Foundation to assist in business continuity initiatives and people to life. Back to Q3 2020. We delivered $605.4 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42. ACA services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 21% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins were 64.6% influenced by software and services mix and a higher Asia Pacific contribution. We registered a record number of new customer logos this quarter and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus traction this quarter. In Q3 2020, cloud titans was our largest vertical. The enterprise is once again consistently our second largest performer followed by a Tier 2 cloud service providers and financials cite for third place, and service providers in fourth place. With respect to sector trends, cloud titans are now approximately 37%, enterprise and financials also are approximately 37% and providers, which is our cloud service providers\u2019 combination is approximately at 26%. What is clear is Arista's cloud and support now apply to all sectors, and we are diversifying roles across customers and verticals. In terms of geography mix, international contribution was 25% with the Americas at 75%. The European business recovered from Q2 and the Asia business has had a particularly strong quarter. In the absence of a physical Analyst Day this year, we would like to shed some light on our strategy for addressing our 30-plus billion dollar plan. The past decade can be best characterized by Arista\u2019s momentum in cloud networking. But in the past four quarters, we have experienced a triad storm of cloud titan volatility, COVID pandemic and deferred revenue related comp. Despite this tough reset year, we believe Arista will emerge stronger, not only returning to double-digit growth in 2021 but also aiming for consistent growth in the years beyond. We expect our multi-year growth cycles from three major product line contributors. One, our core cloud and data center products, our largest business building upon our flagship Arista EOS with the hallmarks of lease fine topology across our five major verticals. Two, our second market is the number of adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our recent entry into the cognitive, campus workspaces. The routing market consists of core spine, edge and peering use-cases for a Tier 1, 2, 3 service cloud and enterprises. The campus brings a cognitive unified edge for wired and WiFi endpoints, as well as new IoT devices and a two tier leaf spine or spline network. We do expect to disrupt the campus and rather incumbency of the last few decades in the next few years. Our third category is network, software and services, based on software subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, Cloud EOS router for multi cloud, big switch monitoring and our latest entry into advanced network detection and response with the acquisition of Awake Security. Elaborating on our focus on subscription-based software, this product line is typically multi-year contracts. Customer are driving mandates for network automation, monitoring visibility across their dataset. We believe the recent acquisition of Awake Security is a strategic contributor that transforms the silo aspects of security into a seamless, secure network. The moment a cloud blurs the perimeter and the increased use of IoT and shadow IT means that our CIOs and CSOs need a network ground of truth. Simply storing the raw data or alerts isn't comprehensible data. A new AI driven, data driven, state driven software stack, like Arista provides is foundational. In our opinion, the security in the industry is going through a metamorphosis, from point security to proactive, predictive, secure networking. CloudVision, combined with Arista\u2019s 2020 acquisitions of Big Switch Networks observability and Awake Security for autonomous spec hunting are very natural software additions to this category. The Cognitive Campus is a priority for Arista's adjacent product line. We are witnessing a massive transition in the COVID era to work-from-home. But the boundary between the office, the home, the teleworker transit and the user is blurring into elastic and flexible workspaces. Arista's recent introduction of the Cognitive Campus is a safe and data driven model, coupled with a unified dashboard for wired and wireless edge for next generation zero touch campus deployments. This combined with the Awake network detection and response security feeds into our campus visibility flow tracker for both IoT and OT application. We do expect our campus portfolio to double by the end of 2021, as we invest in both engineering and go-to-market models. A fitting example is today's announcement of our flagship 750 Series campus chassis, delivering a combination of industry leading chassis density, performance for high definition video failover resilience for rolling upgrades, cognitive COE and secure encryption. I would like to invite Andy Bechtolsheim, our Founder and Chief Development Officer to highlight our launch today. Andy? Andy Bechtolsheim : Yes. We like markets that are right for real innovation and the campus networking market is a prime example of that. With the launch of our 750 Series modular chassis, we are introducing a next generation platform that delivers more performance, more security, more visibility and more power capabilities than any other products in its class. The 750 has 400-gigabits per second uplink throughput, which is 5 times the performance of our nearest competitor. This level of performance is key to support WiFi 6 where each access point has upto 5 gigabits throughput. With a single 750 chassis, we can support a full complement of 384 WiFi 6 access points. In addition the 750 offers MACsec encryption on every port, which supports secure communication from the WiFi through the entire campus network. The 750 also breaks new ground in density being 3U more compact than our closest competitor. Combined with the legendary reliability of Arista's EOS offering system, the 750 offers unmatched performance, security, availability, visibility and power handling. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Andy. That was great. I'm excited, I could use one at home. Next generation routing is another key adjacent market for us lead by the bringing the union of two boss level approaches, layer two switches and layer three routers together for rich protocol support, resiliency, scale, and programmability. This has been a four to five-year endeavor for us to bring disruptive economics via advanced merchant silicon and Arista's modern software stack, EOS. We're starting to see the fruits of this labor. Arista customers now see us as a compelling and cloud -- and carrier grade routing alternative to expensive legacy routers. We're extending beyond classical lease spine intra DC use cases to multi terabit routing offering lower power and higher density interconnect, accelerating WAN and inter-DC routing use cases. Our investments in the simplification of Arista's routing stack with standards-based EVP and BTP and segment routing are yielding early traction. We have won a few important Tier 2, Tier 3 service provider customers for many of these use-cases, including fine interconnect, multi-access edge, layer two layer three VPNs and pairing use cases. Our core universal cloud network design for data center continues to expand with Arista as the pioneer. We have been the market leader, driving to the number one position 100 gigabit ethernet switching market and early leadership in 400-gig with flexible software partnerships for SONIC, open config and FBOSS with our cloud titan customers. We have been pushing beyond the local storage compute and AI clusters at cloud scale. This quarter, we delivered CloudVision managed in a time series state driven database as a network-wide service hosted in the cloud. Clearly, their enabling cloud principals across the entire enterprise with five As of agility, availability, automation, analytics, and an AI and API driven network. Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer, will add some more color on our cloud customer traction. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. Arista has a been a leader in cloud networking based on our nimble execution, product quality and ability to co-develop with our customers. Cloud companies are highly impressed with the work we've done over the last decade are engaging us more than ever to discuss their architectures for the future. The advent of the facilities and related silicon is driving a product transition. We are winning new RFPs on next gen products, both 100 gig and 400 gig. We have expanded our footprint from data center leaf spine and DCI to now encompass WAN and Edge used cases traditionally supported by legacy routers. While there's a lot of talk about white boxes and 400 gig, our customers have maintained status quo. We have not seen a change in position from this status quo. Customers for used white boxes are continuing to use white boxes. Whereas customers who use Arista switches are continuing to use our products for today and for the future design. If anything, some use cases currently covered by internally developed white boxes may transition to our feature rich products in a few years. Cloud companies upgrade at a massive scale and they're continuing to grow. This scale makes them lean more on us for technology and support. Our cloud customers see immense value in working with us, and we have high customer satisfaction here. Our portfolio is highly competitive and we are being told that we are ahead of competition. Hence it is unlikely that we will see significant share shift. Savvy cloud titans are not influenced by pretty marketing slides. Our R3 Series products have now been quantified by all our major cloud customers for several 100 gig times 400 gig use cases. We will keep marching on. Back to you Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Anshul, and we will be marching on. Well said on the cloud titan success. So in summary, Arista's vision now traces LAN, WAN, cloud networking, with clear diversification across customers, products and verticals. It's rooted in a more software data driven network, built across customer data sets and managed by CloudVision. We have built a transformative architecture, harnessing the new trends in IoT computing, unified edge, archiving data across the network. Our customers resonate with this vision. And I couldn't be more upbeat on our strategy, our innovation, our quality of support and our customer migration from legacy siloed places in the network to cognitive clients to cloud networking, which we call places in the cloud. We have now deployed a cumulative of 40 million ports over the past 12-years. With that, I will turn it over to Ita our Chief Financial Officer for more financial specifics. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. Let me announce our Q3 results, our guidance for Q4 2020 based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock based compensation impacts, certain acquisition related charges and other non-recurring items. Full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $605.4 million, down 7.5% year-over-year, well above the upper end of our guidance or $570 million to $590 million and up 12% from the prior quarter. While we saw some improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remain somewhat constrained to some extent with continuation of extended lead times into Q4. Service and software support revenues represented approximately 21% of total revenue, down slightly from 22% last quarter. International revenue for the quarter came in at $152.7 million or 25.2% of total revenue, up from 19.4% in the second quarter. While the shift in the geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis was largely due to the location of deployments by our cloud titan customers, we did see some incremental improvements in our in region businesses also. Overall, gross margin in Q3 was 64.6%, above the midpoint of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65% and consistent with last quarter. We continue to recognize incremental COVID related costs in the period, including elevated freight and component costs. Operating expenses for the quarter were $159.4 million or 26.3% of revenue, up from last quarter at $144.1 million. We began to increase operating expense investments during the third quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. R&D spending came in at $106.1 million or 17.5% of revenue, up from $91.6 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs and increased new product introductions related spending in the period. Sales and marketing expenses -- $43.1 million or 7.1% of revenue, up from $41.9 million last quarter with increased variable compensation and other personnel costs. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $10.2 million or 1.7% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter at approximately $10.6 million. Our operating income for the quarter was $231.5 million or 38.2% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $13.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.6%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $192 million or 31.7% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $2.42, down 10% from the prior year. Please note that included in other income and expense for the quarter was a one-time gain on the sale of investments of $9.4 million. In addition, given current low interest rate environment, all other things being equal, we would expect other income of approximately $3 million per quarter throughout the coming year. The acquisition of Awake Security closed on October 7th and we are now focused on integrating of purchase accounting. The acquisition will not have a material impact on the financials for the current quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.85 billion. We repurchased $167.3 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $208 per share. As a reminder, we have now repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board organization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years commencing in Q2 '19. In terms of capital allocation, which expects us to continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining authorization. We generated $215.1 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, reflecting solid net income performance and a consistent level of overall working capital investment. We expect to continue to strategically increase inventory levels through the end of the year as we improve lead times and attempt to buffer against any future COVID-related supply chain disruptions. DSOs came in at 46 days, down from 65 days in Q2, reflecting linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2 times, down from 2.3 last quarter. Inventory increased to $438 million in the quarter, up from $327 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. Our total deferred revenue balance was $562 million, down from $577 million in Q2. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services-related. The level of services of our revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewal, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Accounts payable days were 70 days, up from 59 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.5 million. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. While we remain cautious around the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and our business, we have seen some incremental improvement in underlying business trends. Activity in our enterprise and provider sectors has remained healthy, with increased win rates across what is for us a relatively underpenetrated part of the market. In addition, we have continued to solidly and consistently execute against the needs of our cloud titans customers. We believe a combination of these trends, combined with favorable year over year comparatives, supports the current consensus growth rate of 13% to 14% for fiscal 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 53% to 55%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. Turning to spending and investment. While we will continue to carefully manage spending, we are committed to making go-forward, results-based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business. While it won't happen overnight, especially in an environment of resumed top line growth, we would take this opportunity to remind you of our long-term operating margin targets of plus or minus 35%. Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q4 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact to our business and supply chain. This is, however, inherently uncertain and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excluded noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows; revenues of approximately $615 million to $635 million, gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9%, diluted shares of approximately 79 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis? Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I\u2019d like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, you may go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I'll just keep it simple. Jayshree, I think everyone on the call would recognize that you sound a lot more confident about returning to double-digit growth than you did 90 days ago. So I'm wondering what's driving that. Is it some of the 400-gig wins coming in as you expected or is it the underlying customer spending starting to improve that's driving that increased confidence to what we heard a quarter ago? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I think when you look at the foundation and fundamentals of Arista, they didn't change. We've always had superior products and very strong customer traction. But I think we got our customers and Arista got used to the uncertainty of COVID, and COVID became a new norm, and people have to start planning their spends. So we saw a very balanced and customer traction across all our verticals and all our sectors in Q3. Whereas I wouldn't say the same for Q2 and Q1, whereas we were still figuring things out. So I think the combination of an unchanged strategy, a highly differentiated product and we're just winning in every sector. And there's no silver bullet but humming on all four cylinders gives us a newfound confidence. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt from UBS. David Vogt : Maybe just a big picture industry question, if you guys could entertain me. Can you share your thoughts on the proposed Marvell Inphi transaction that was announced last week and maybe what it might mean for the industry holistically as we kind of move forward into 2021? That would be great. Jayshree Ullal : I'll try. I mean, I came from the semiconductor world two decades ago. But as you know, there's been a lot of semi consolidation in video arm, Maxim, analog digital and now Marvell Inphi. I think the way to look at this is semiconductor companies are -- the large ones are trying to get larger and the smaller ones are producing some real innovative technology but need scale. We are very impressed with Inphi. They've been an important partner for us and they have both very best-of-breed technology in the 30s and optic side, and it's something that Marvell lacks. So hopefully, some of the strength they bring, especially to the cloud will help Marvell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : I just wanted to just check on a comment made by Anshul earlier in a transcript regarding white boxes. And you made the comment that some customers may deploy white boxes today and then eventually swap that out for a feature-rich Arista product in the future. Now is there maybe a rationale behind why they would want to deploy data centers filled with white box infrastructure or white box equipment and then eventually swap it out? Can you just explain to us the transition that would take place in design or just in the thought process for why they would do that after they've gone down the white box route? Anshul Sadana : Sami, the word has talked about by just from one dimension for many, many years but remember, our customers do that analysis in both directions, not just one. And as their scale grows and their needs grow, the network is getting more complicated. And in certain situations when they reach a point where they need even more functionality than is EV to build internally. And they want to stay competitive in the market and not miss on timing, they do start looking out as well. But as I mentioned, these are future trends that take a couple of years at least to happen. But these are certainly ongoing discussions and issues going on in our space today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex Kurtz : Glad to hear everyone's doing well and safe at Arista, and congrats on the quarter, Jayshree. Just on your comments about software and maintenance becoming roughly 20% of the business. Can this growth in your portfolio of software products, whether designed internally or acquired, to maybe accelerate that software renewal base to where maybe in a couple of years, we're looking at 30%, 40% of the business, if you can go back to these big cloud titans and kind of demonstrate the value of these bigger software portfolios that you didn't have a couple of years ago and really expand that base of software? Jayshree Ullal : I think very observant of you to note that when we say it's 20% of our business, it's not just services, it's software renewals and subscriptions. So it's already starting to have a contribution. Can it be greater, greater than 20, 25? Yes. It would be harder to be 30 and 40, especially with the cloud titans, because cloud titans tend to think they can and they have the resources to build many of these tools themselves. So I would say all the other four verticals are more likely to embrace our software subscription while the cloud titans may take it in bits and pieces. They would take it in components but not an entirety. But I certainly think this segment where we can have subscription multiyear contracts is an important part of our triad stool of core networking, adjacent networking and network as a service capability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have a question on the trends in the quarter. Product growth. So overall revenues are down 7.5%, but it's not even between products and services. Product growth is down about 13.5% year-over-year and services are up 26%. So I'm trying to understand both sides. I'm trying to understand the strong growth in services versus the steeper decline in products? Jayshree Ullal : So first, remember, again, services includes many of our software subscriptions and multiyear contracts. So it's not just services whereas product is very clearly perpetual product. So look, I think the comps with deferred revenue never helped us from last year to this year. But I wouldn't read too much into the trend, except to say we're getting stickier with services and software, and we can only do better with product. Ita Brennan : I mean, I think, Tal, the services should continue to grow and continue to be a more meaningful piece of the business and layer the software on top of that. And then product is recovering but it is recovering. You can see that in the Q4 guide and into our commentary for next year as well. So I think they're just different drivers at this particular point in time, but they should both start to grow as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from MKM Partners. Fahad Najam : A couple of things. If I look at your working capital, it seems like your inventories have gone up significantly, while your accounts payable are also awful. But can you just help us understand what's happening, why the investors are up so much? Are you expecting a significant forthcoming demand ramp in the next couple of quarters? Ita Brennan : No, I think, Fahad, what we're really doing is we're buffering, again, some of the uncertainties around COVID. And if you look at the Q when we file it, you'll see that a good portion of that increase is still raw materials and components. There was some uptick in the finished goods right at the end of the quarter for particular products but we still have more work to do around expanding that to other products. But our goal is to have sufficient buffers that if we do get some more shocks from COVID that we're able to react and that we're in a better position to react than we were maybe on the first wave. So it really is just a focus around making sure we've got more optionality and flexibility. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, I think you kind of said it during the call, but I'm going to ask you if you could -- in your outlook for next year, the double digit growth in your endorsement of the 13% to 14% consensus number. To get there, I think I heard you say you expect your campus portfolio to double by the end of 2021. Are you saying you expect campus revenue to double? And can I ask you to go through what your expectations are for the cloud, for enterprise and financials and for your service providers to get to that double-digit growth? Jayshree Ullal : So as you know, we said last quarter that we have achieved -- this is our first year at campus. We're still young kids here, and we've achieved our first 100 million. And if you may recall, we said it would take us four to six quarters to double. I don't yet know if it will be four or six but we are feeling pretty good, particularly with our product announcement today and the campus traction we're getting that we didn't feel last quarter. So yes, the goal is to definitely double that $100 million to $200 million by the end of 2021 in revenue, and let's hope we can do better. In terms of segments, I think it's too early to call a breakdown but we're very comfortable with the annual consensus for 2021. Ita, do you want to answer that? Ita Brennan : I think, Paul, we're not going to try to do it by vertical at this point. We feel like there is -- between the campus stuff that you talked about, between the growth and services, cloud has resumed growth and then the rest of the business has also been performing well. I think between all of those drivers, you have multiple different ways to get there, and we'll see exactly how it plays out. And I think we're not going to try to take which verticals we're going to do what at this point. Paul Silverstein : Can I ask you this, I trust that you get there, cloud has to be healthy by definition\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : No, I think -- I hope you noticed our upbeat tone, especially Anshul's. We started the year saying it will be flat to down and then we\u2019ve said it will be flattish. And at this point, I think we're feeling like cloud can be a growth -- cloud titans can also grow next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. Jeff Kvaal : I was wondering if you two wouldn't mind giving us a little bit of some of the thought process behind the guidance. I guess, one part is there's another partner in the supply chain at one of your customers that cast a pall over 2020. And I'm wondering if that particular issue in semi was resolved. And then the other question is, could you help us a little bit with the assumption of 400 and when that starts to layer in to the 2021 outlook. Thanks. Ita Brennan : Again, the rationale for the guidance, I think if you look at the various pieces, pretty much what we talked about with Paul a few minutes ago. I mean there are multiple different pieces of the business, and we've seen positive trends across those sectors, not all of those reflected in revenue today. But in the enterprise vertical being good, solid wins that will drive some revenue traction into 2021. And then for cloud, I think we feel like we've got -- we're in the window of starting to understand their plans for next year and feeling more confident around those drivers as well. And then obviously, the rest of the business continues to grow, looking at service software, et cetera, the more ratable piece of the business. So I think those are the building blocks and we like to put those building blocks together in multiple different ways and feel good about the guidance, and that's kind of where we come out for next year. Jayshree Ullal : Jeff, I think Ita said this best. We expect cloud titan trends to improve in 2021, based on both the CapEx projections, which for us isn't a huge indicator because we're a small number. But bulk of these deployments will be 25-gig, 100-gig and even some 400-gig. I think the white box and the overall competitive landscape, much as everyone fears it, is unchanged. And we're seeing a status quo and look forward to share gains in new roles in campus, data center routing and cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. George Notter : Very interested to hear the commentary about routing and all the different use cases you're pursuing in that space. Maybe you could kind of talk about your definition of success in routing? And also, could you give us a sense for where you are now in routing applications, percentage of sales or amount of revenue you're driving there? And then maybe looking forward, what use cases are you in today? And what use cases will you be in going forward? Jayshree Ullal : It's difficult to break it down, as I've always told you, because routing and switching off go together. But what we saw as a trend is we've always sort of aimed for the big elephants or the Tier 1 service providers, and those take time. But we started winning, particularly this year, we turned the corner on winning a lot of Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers, not only in the US, but internationally. And these use cases tended to be telco cloud. Some of them were just very happy with the multi-vendor combination of EVPN, BGP stack from us. Some of them were peering use cases. So these are all classical routing use cases with better disruptive economics, programmability, resilience and routing features that they have come to know and love from others but that they could get better from us. And then also, we're doing very, very well in the cloud customer base as well. We have been for some time. So the combination of all this to say that routing is not just with the service providers, it is now permeating all our five verticals. George Notter : And is there one product delivery or feature delivery that has allowed you to turn the quarter in the service provider space, or anything you can attribute that to? Jayshree Ullal : If we know the service providers as well as you do, it's never one feature. It's a long list of them. So we've been working it for four to five years, and I think the combination of it has led to more success. But there's always one more feature to do, George, as you know. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I wanted to just ask kind of a housekeeping question and then the main one. The housekeeping is, do you guys think deferred revenue will become an issue in '21 because of 400-gig rollout? Do you think we'll see product deferred revenue building up again? And then I also wanted to go back to enterprise. It seems like a time when enterprises, if anything, would be slow spending that you guys have really accelerated at least sequential growth there. And there's a lot of absolute additional revenue in Q3. So just curious, do you think you're pulling any revenue forward on enterprise, or how does that look like continues the next few quarters for you? Thanks. Ita Brennan : I think on the deferred, it's always difficult to forecast when we'll have customer requirements, et cetera, for acceptance. I mean, it tends to be lastly for some very differentiated or different product set, particularly under the current accounting. So we'll see. It's hard to predict that there would be some of that or not at this point. But it's more difficult to get to a deferred bar. It would have to be a very differentiated product going forward. Jayshree Ullal : Rod, I'll just say it feels good to be back after a tough few quarters. The enterprises love our product and they want to buy more. And if anything, I would say opposite of pull in, we're still slightly supply constrained versus demand and are experiencing some shortages that will hopefully improve by the end of the year. So no pull-in for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim Suva : And really heartfelt congratulations to you and your team for very strong results and outlook during COVID. My question is regarding the outlook for 2021, when you mentioned consensus up 13% to 14%, you're comfortable with that. Does that bake into the most recent CapEx outlooks that we were provided last week? It's notable that like Facebook gave an outlook of materially up [100%]. And I know that you're wrapping up and getting ready for earnings and things, but I believe their CapEx is supposed to be up 30% to 40%. But would that be additive? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes, Jim, I mean, this is our current view as of today of what we feel comfortable with for 2021, and then we'll see. There's always going to be puts and takes on the CapEx to networking correlation has its challenges, right? So we'll see where it goes from there. That's what we see as of today. Jayshree Ullal : Jim, thank you for the question. As you know, the CapEx includes building leases, capital. So the networking component is very, very small. Ita and I were talking earlier, as I was with Anshul, too, it's generally less than or around 5%. So it's hard to make any specific decision based on CapEx. But as an overall trend, we are pleased that the CapEx is going up next year but then we'll keep watching this quarter-by-quarter because it tends to be lumpy and volatile. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. James Fish : Ita, you went over the negatives of the higher freight cost but also the positives of lower travel. To your best understanding, what was the net impact of COVID-19 on OpEx this last quarter? And then DSOs would imply a more front-end-loaded quarter that either insinuates a slowdown in September or was it just lack of needing to push more business that we have a strong backlog heading into Q4? Ita Brennan : I mean, the DSO is actually the biggest driver this quarter was just we exited with a high balance at the end of last quarter, right? We were very back-end-loaded last quarter, and then you can collect against that, and that drives some good traction through the quarter. So I think we were -- Jayshree mentioned, we still have some supply chain constraints we were still receiving in inventory, and you saw that in the accounts payable as well. So we were still a little bit back end loaded through the quarter, but we had a good balance to collect against coming into the quarter. I don't know that I'm going to try to size exactly what the COVID impact is. There is a little bit in gross margin and you've seen that in the product margins. And there's travel, some marketing expenses, et cetera, probably a couple of million or so that comes out of the sales and marketing line because of it as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Jason Ader : On the campus side, just wondering what types of customers are actually buying this stuff and then the stuff working from home. It's just surprising to me that you're winning a lot of new logos there. So that's kind of the first part of the question. Second part of the question is the 750 Series product. Is this a big hole in your portfolio? And do you think that it could actually accelerate some of your traction in the campus market? Jayshree Ullal : First of all, you'll be pleasantly surprised as I am that even though people are not coming back to smart buildings or their headquarters, it's really vertical-dependent, as you know. Some of the logistics and healthcare and some of the business-critical ones do need to go back and do need connectivity and performance in a far more distributed elastic fashion. So I think campus is back, just not the way we thought it would be. The emphasis on unified wire, wireless rather than specific smart buildings is the change we're seeing. And it also gives them -- what we noticed is it's also giving them a chance to plan better, because there's in the building you can't plan but now you can do a lot more proof-of-concept testing. I'm very excited with the 750. There's a whole billion of installed base of some of my old products called the Catalyst that are ripe and old in age. And Anshul, you want to comment on the beauty of that? Anshul Sadana : Jason, we're very excited with what they're doing, but not a lot of this is driven by feedback from customers. There's immense interest in the 750 Series, and that's broadening our portfolio. When you look at the Fortune 1000 type of enterprises, they absolutely need high density and high performance even in campus. And yes, there are certain companies thinking that since the employees are not in the office, let's not upgrade our refresh but there are also certain companies thinking that there aren't enough employees in the office, so let's go ahead and refresh. And that's really what's driving a lot of the change in the enterprise as well. But the feature set, consistent POS, CloudVision, automation, a lot of the visibility and the benefits to give to people is important to them. If your video conference has jiggered, you don't want to be debugging in the middle of the day, you need to resolve by itself and move on and those are the capabilities we deliver with our products. Jason Ader : Anshul, which is the catalyst comparable from Cisco that is\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : I think there's a couple of them. There's 4000 series and the 6500 series. Anshul Sadana : And the CAS 9400. Jayshree Ullal : And the presently shipping one is the 9400, but the older ones are the 4K and the 6500. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz from Rosenblatt Securities. Ryan Koontz : I wonder if we could circle back to the campus opportunity again and look at the competitive front there. Obviously, you guys have great technology. And how do you feel you're progressing in terms of building out your channels and displacing the big incumbent there in terms of kind of influence over these larger enterprise Global 2000 type customers? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : I think we have to understand that we are in our second year of campus. And if you look at our competitors, they're in their 10th to 15th or 20th year. They're very mature. So definitely, we've got work to do on go-to-market models. So our first area of focus there is our existing customers. When we have over 6,500 of them, some facilities of them love our EOS and CloudVision and want to use us. The second is we are making more progress on the channel side. We're not signing up everybody, but we certainly see a strong international focus on channels. And I think that will be something we will continue to invest in. And the third is, for the last two, three years, we have been investing in the enterprise go-to-market led by Chris Mit and Ashwin Kohi under Rashman. So we're starting to see the fruits of our labor and just enterprise traction, whether it's in the data center or campus and it's taken us the better part of two to three years to achieve that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : A couple from me, maybe just kind of to drill down some of the questions were asked. First, on the cloud, clearly, you're more bullish here. So it's great to hear. Can you clarify whether this includes Facebook sort of refresh? Is that finally back on track and you've got a piece of that? And then pigging back on the question that Jason had on the campus in new 750, congrats there. Cisco just refreshed 9400. I guess when I look at your solution right now online, it looks like you have a couple of cool features there, always on POE, but a supervisor, data plane separation. But it was my impression that this whole chassis campus category is on a massive decline. Customers moving into fixed architectures, not modular at all. So help me understand how much really is the opportunity here? And when you talk about your confidence in doubling the campus business through next year. Is this going to be a material contributor to that or this is really for thereafter? Anshul Sadana : Ittai, I wouldn't say that the Facebook server refreshes in our guidance model, but all of our cloud titan network plans for the next year are in our models. Let's decouple that a little bit and then we have the data we have today from our customers for using that. So we're confident that there is growth coming back next year on that side. Jayshree Ullal : And on the 750, both Anshul and I have been involved a lot in chassis in our prior lives. I think if there's anything that will be under constraint, it's the stackables. Customers are moving to more and more distributed 1RU. And one of the things that probably got a little unnoticed in our announcement today is our 2RU 96 port, which obviates the need for any stampable. And then for the really high-density distributed buildings, which have large employees, large headquarters, you do need 750. You need the investment protection of 100-gig uplinks. You need the density and footprint and power. You need the operational power management. You need the security. You need the always on failover time for rolling upgrades. And I think what's happened, at least in our minds, is the chassis has gone from being a physical cable plant discussion to much more of an automation, visibility, security discussion. You need all the properties that you had in the data center. So that market is coming to us. So we feel good that there's -- it's a new product, it will take time to qualify, but it is a contributor to our number in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Maybe wanted to touch on just kind of what sort of traction you're seeing with existing customers from your Big Switch and Awake Security acquisitions and just whether that could be -- I understand it's not material to Q4, but a more material contributor to 2021. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : I definitely think it's a strategic contributor to 2021 in bookings. As you know, the revenue may follow as multiyear contracts in software, network software and subscription models. So how material will it be in 2021? Probably small. But both those are very strategic to influencing our customers' decisions on the data center and campus. And in general, helping with their operational -- their architectural experience and their operational experience, it's a huge differentiator. So observability, monitoring, in-line data analysis capability and then the autonomous threat hunting. It's so important now because the firewall or the perimeter of the firewall is just collapsed. So the ability to do that is we just closed the Awake acquisition in October. So it's too early to tell. But the one thing we can tell is everyone's interested in it. Anshul, you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Jayshree, you actually are right. With IoT and sensors and campuses and work environments, the monitoring is going to be very, very different. And there's an unmet need in this space today and I think a way with a very well with the AI technology as well as Big Switch in the market side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I want to go back to one of Ittai's question. And I can appreciate that you're not factoring in kind of Facebook and server refresh cycle in the context of your guidance. But if you go back in time, how do you think about the context of server cycles and how that pulls through your business just to give a historical backdrop? Because as we look into '21, you've got, obviously, a big refresh for Intel. You've got A&D pushed into service CPU cycle. I'm just curious to how you think about that pull-through effect on Arista's business? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Aaron, I don't think it's changed much. Of course what happens is you got to get the buildings and the power and the cooling in, then you got to get the servers. And there's typically a one to two quarter lag on the network. And so clearly, the service cycle comes ahead of us, which is why we felt the pain we did last year. Hopefully, we'll feel the gain of it next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre Ferragu : Jayshree, you mentioned in your opening remarks that outside of your core switching market, you had growth opportunities in routing, campus and software and services. And I was wondering over like a three, maybe to five year time horizon, how much of your growth do you think is going to come from these additional segments versus how much is still going to come from switching, your core switching market? Jayshree Ullal : Well, Ita is telling me not to answer this question. [Multiple Speakers] From a vision perspective, we think those two segments, the new markets where we're underpenetrated, we're in the early innings in both network adjacencies and software and services will grow faster than our core market. How about I leave it at that? Is that a good enough answer? Ita Brennan : That's a good enough answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Tim Long : Can we just hit on the telco vertical? It seems like it's still towards the bottom of the pecking order, at least in your results. So what's going on there? What do you think you get that going? Is it just increasing the routing use cases and further penetrating on that regard or maybe the addition of more security features, which often do well in the telco networks? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I think unlike the cloud, where they will adopt our routing features, even if we're missing one or two and then operationalize it, you know very well, service providers want every bell and whistle. And as I said in my opening remarks, it's taking us the better part of four, five years. We're making very good traction in Tier 2 or 3. Tier 1 is still taking time. But in this year, we have won some early design wins in Tier 1 as well. So the numbers are small. So I think in order to make them break, they need to spend more from us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, maybe if I just go back to this double-digit sales growth expectation for calendar '21. Just trying to understand, is that an organic statement, is that a total revenue growth statement, how do we think about that? And then broadly, when I hear you talk about calendar '21, it sounds like the growth vectors are getting much more diversified than they historically have been. And I'm wondering how does that play out into your operating expenses and perhaps the need to expanding infrastructure further in calendar '21? Jayshree Ullal : Amit, just to take the question upfront, it is absolutely based on products as we have now organically. We're not factoring any future products or M&A in that discussion. And maybe, Ita, you want to talk about the\u2026 Ita Brennan : Yes. I think on the investment side, with the top line returning to growth, that gives us a lot of room to make those investments and maybe a little bit more than that, we'll see. But we certainly have the growth on the top line to do that. My script did remind everybody that our target model is 35% operating margin. And we're reserving the right to do that, should we find the right investments to make. And we'll be very metric-driven around that as we go forward. But that's kind of the target model longer term. In the meantime, we'll have the benefit of top line growth to help with the investments in the near term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to take your sense on a scenario. If we assume an existing Arista customer wants to upgrade a data center to 200-gig, not 400 but 200-gig, what does that mean for Arista? Is it a line card change for a swap of chassis? And if it is a swap of chassis, you risk losing share in that kind of upgrade scenario for one of your customers? Thank you. Anshul Sadana : Simon, while we haven't talked about 200-gig broadly, there are certain customers looking at these types of technologies. And since we're staying with the four lean architecture at [4550]. The good news is all of the products we mentioned, the R3 series, some in the [7060] series, some in the 7300 series, all of them support not just 400-gig but also 200 gig. So we are aware of the need in certain cases of 200-gig now very, very well poised to actually grow or benefit from that as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho from Bloomberg Intelligence. Woo Jin Ho : So an intermediate-term technology question here. So the question has been asked. So NVIDIA and Marvell has been talking a lot about DPUs in the data center. It sounds like if we given starting to get a little bit more complex of the architectures at least. Does DPUs present a growth opportunity for you in the cloud that we may not have considered in the past? Anshul Sadana : This is a bit too early to say where the DPUs will come disrupt or is there a lot of marketing in terms of offload engines. Remember, offload engines, especially on servers, have been around for many, many years and this might have special instruction sets for the new types of outlooks the world is looking at. But so far, we don't see any major impact to networking like us, maybe even a benefit because that drives the change in architecture and actually helps us compare from the incumbency. Jayshree Ullal : I think they generally have been co-processors, they don't take away the need for a CPU. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jon Lopez from Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : I just had one clarification for Ita on the deferred side. Ita, the deferred has gone marginally lower sequentially each of the last two quarters. And I just want to make sure I understand. Are there puts and takes in that? Is that now more, say, dependent on larger renewals that happen periodically through the course of the year? So if you can just talk a second about that? And also, is there anything in that trending that we should think about as we think about services revenue in 2021? Ita Brennan : Yes. No, that's exactly what it is. I mean, it's almost all services now and it's really going to move around more by the term and the timing of just those renewals, whether I renew one year or three years, it doesn't really make any difference in the business but it will show up in that deferred revenue line item. The revenue will still be pretty consistent, because you're recognizing it over time. But the deferred line will move around. So if we have a big renewal on a multiyear contract, that number is going to go up. As we renew just one year and come back to do the next later, it won't increase or it might decline slightly because we're recognizing some of that revenue. So it's going to move around a bit but it's not a business driver. It's just more how are we negotiating and closing out. Curtis McKee : This concludes the Arista Q3 2020 Earnings Call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks\u2019 management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, our product innovation and the benefits of recent acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. If there's one thing that pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real-time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created a new norm as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us. Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titan was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%, Enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%, and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26%, with the Americas at 74% for Q4, 2020. Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multi-year growth part based on three major product line evolutions. One, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, these spine architecture and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these two adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks. Our third category is network software and services. Based on subscription models, such as Arista Acare, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMS, and advanced net of detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows. The boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, Teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. We believe Arista is well-positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMS or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust Vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken? Kenneth Duda : Thanks, Jayshree. A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day one without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro-Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high-performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream, switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role, Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course, security. Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ken. Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced six EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EOS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multi-year inflection ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million, or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis is largely due to the location of deployments by our third - by our cloud titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in region businesses this quarter. Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%. At the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financial customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million, or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. R&D spending came in at $110.2 million, or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million, or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $13 million, or 2% of revenue of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million, or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves, for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a one-time effect, and the rate will likely return to a more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods. Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion. To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million, or 54%, of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million, or 31%, to fund cash consideration for two acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. To date, we have repurchased $661 million, or 3.2 million shares, against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years commencing in Q2 2019. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8 times, down from 2 times last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period, as we continue to buffer certain components and products. Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in cloud titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid cloud titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. We believe the combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix remaining the key driver. Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go forward results based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business. Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1, reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows, revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles? Charles Yager : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I\u2019d like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Maybe just a comment around - you just announced the kind of Macro Segmentation kind of security portfolio. Just as your broadening out the campus portfolio, just other security features and functionalities that you think you will need or other partnerships that you think you'll need to expand upon to just, kind of, address that customer base that maybe the needs are different than the data center needs? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Meta. And as you know, we've had a very robust set of partnerships. So we will be working on securing the network. But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with - different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones. You have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall [Technical Difficulty] more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba, ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is, security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners. Looking ahead, we see other forms of security, too. And I'd love for Ken or Anshul to comment because whether it is securing the networks and segmentation and the many forms we talked about. But also more and more in the data center encryption capabilities and privacy, whether it's network-wide or how to pop and in the campus, bringing security all the way down to our wireless. So Ken or Anshul, do you want to say something more about that? Anshul Sadana : Sure, Jayshree. Helping our enterprise customers connect to the cloud is extremely important. And as you know, there's no one single way to connect your enterprise apps to these cloud apps. There are 1,000 different ways, whether it's Express, Direct Connect, Different Hops, Meet Me In The Middle, different service providers. And we're quite focused on enabling more and more functionality there with different forms of tunneling, taking our Vaseline EVPN approach for enterprises and marrying it to what happens on the cloud side, different types of encryption channels and so on. Ken, anything you want to add? Kenneth Duda : Yes. I just wanted to add that we - our segmentation is simply the newest announcement that we've made in this area. But we have a robust portfolio of security features already, including hardware support for Mac second IPSEC to secure individual links, including multistage ACLs for advanced Packet classification, and several other features, wireless intrusion prevention. So I think that, customers are already able to build a fully secured network on, networking solutions. And that said, well, of course, be looking to partner, in the future with anyone who can help us build a more secure solution. Meta Marshall : Okay. Great. Thanks. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Meta. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Ryan Koontz : Hi. Thanks for question. I wanted to ask you about the semi supply chain. You talked about building inventory in the quarter on key parts. Can you give us a little more color on, what's going on there? We do hear about production capacity issues, and obviously, lead times are starting to stretch out, you feel you give us some comfort you feel comfortable with your commitments from your suppliers and what you're seeing out there? I appreciate it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Ryan, as we said, we have been constrained much of 2020, starting with March. So this has been a real issue for the entire supply chain. We have products with extremely large lead times that we plan ahead for. And I would be remiss, if I didn't say we while we have some great partners, that the semiconductor supply chain is still constrained. Ita and her team, as well as Anshul and the team have taken some very important steps, to build out our inventory for some of these long lead time components, but we could use a lot more parts than we still have. Ryan Koontz : Helpful. Thanks very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes. Thank you. Jayshree, can you talk about what's driving your momentum in the enterprise would you say it's more of the product portfolio that's expanded, or is it just the build-out of your sales and distribution infrastructure? Or maybe it's both? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think the simple answer, Jason, is it is both. We've been making multiyear investments on both the product side. First of all, both in the data center but also going beyond the data center to different roles and use cases. And Anshul and Chris Schmidt, and Ashwin and the team have been building out our capacity, both in the US and internationally. But I would say the third thing that's also clicking is our best-of-breed product capability. It's one thing to invest in it, but customers are really resonating with a single OS, cloud vision being a huge differentiator. We just crossed over 1,000 CloudVision customers since we started shipping this product a few years ago. So I think the ability to not just build a great network, but to operate it, and for them to experience that quality of experience has made it much more complete. So I would say great products, great go-to-market and then a high-quality operation and experience. Jason Ader : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask about the vertical with regards to providers, you guys beat that pretty solidly against our expectations. So maybe a little bit more color there. And then cloud was a little bit weak. And I'm just curious if you guys are still thinking you can grow cloud this year and is it a single-digit growth rate, et cetera? Maybe you don't want to talk about that. But just curious what your thoughts are on cloud growth this year? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Right, Rod. Well, as you know, cloud has been tough for us and pretty volatile. The visibility on Cloud Titan was very difficult last year. On the other hand, as we've been telling you, we're starting to make good penetration in both Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers as well as our Tier 2 cloud providers. So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans. In terms of asking you question, of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all five verticals in all three sectors. But because we had so much volatility in titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and an intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans. But we did have some delays in their qualification of 400-gig and in spite of all the new products we had, decisions took longer to happen. Anshul, do you want to comment on that? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Jason, our work with the cloud titans collaboration, co-development partnership is coming along fairly well, both for 400-gig as well as 200-gig, we believe we will start to see these ramping second half of the year. And we believe we will do well with the cloud. The Cloud Titan numbers for us are already large. So obviously, you'll never have seen growth rates, but we believe our business will remain solid with them. Operator : And your next\u2026 Rod Hall : Thank you. And\u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Rod. Rod Hall : I was going to say on providers. I don't know if you had any comment on that, but. Jayshree Ullal : Providers are doing well for us. They tend to be seasonal. It depends on when a provider is investing. So I think our specialty providers, some of them are coming back very strong, and they had less investments the prior year. And some of them are also recognizing that they need to be a specialty cloud, just as the name suggests. And not rely on the public cloud. So it's effect we are feeling more optimistic about. Rod Hall : Great. Okay. Thanks, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryani : First of all, congrats on a really good quarter given all the craziness the year has had. I guess my question really is, as I think about the calendar 2021 guide, March, I think, will be up 22%, 23% year-over-year. And I think the full year guidance implied to be on 14%. Beyond the compares, could you just maybe talk about why do you think growth will decelerate as we go through the year, especially given the comments, I think Anshul made about 400-gig ramping up in the back half? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Amit, I think it's really all about kind of if you look at the trend from last year, I mean, it was really a year of two halves, right? You had some very constrained lower numbers in the first half. And then, obviously, we started to recover and exit the year with a very respectable revenue top line number. So a lot of it has to do with the comps. I think you have to think about it more this year, just in terms of progress as we move through the year than necessarily trying to target a particular year-over-year growth rate, just because of how the volatility that we saw in 2020. Ita Brennan : And Amit, just to add to that, yes, we are confident of our position with Cloud Titans. But as you know, our near-term visibility is always better than our long-term. So we'll know better as we go quarter-by-quarter. And I'm looking forward on sure to you raising the forecast. Anshul Sadana : Amit, don't ask those questions again. Amit Daryani : Unlike, she just - thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first, perhaps for Jayshree or Anshu. Could you help us understand where you stand in the value proposition with WiFi and SD WAN? And I bring that up because a lot of your peers in the market will make much of what they are up to in both of those particular categories. And then, I guess, secondarily, either for you, could you perhaps frame for us a bit about the magnitude of the revenue left on the table in the in the fourth quarter? And to what extent that's a factor in your first quarter guidance as well? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Jeff, we'll try to address your two-part question, we'll do our best. So specific to Wifi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and Wifi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes of features and an extension of our WAN routing. So -- but other than that, we're not in that low-end market where we're supplying branch offices to SMBs like VeloCloud or Meraki Might. Operator : And your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you very much. My question has more to do with quantification of the campus switching or enterprise opportunity. Could you be able to give us kind of a quantified number or revenue run rate that you guys came in at as of fourth Q 2020? And Jayshree, I think before, you have guided us to where you want to be at some point from a run rate basis. Has that time line accelerated? Or has it contracted? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sami, I think we told you we wanted to achieve at least $100 million in 2020, and we certainly achieved that. In fact, we exceeded it. And our goal is to double that in this year, and we'll give you more quantification as the year progresses. So we're on track. We're executing well. I won't say it's changed dramatically. Obviously, COVID has slowed down some of the large campus decision-making, but I think it's going to get better. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Just a clarification question. The clarification, take it is basic math with Facebook for the full year was less than $230 million, maybe meaningfully less, but it certainly wasn't more. If I did the math correctly, that would be down over 40%. I'm just wondering, hoping you could confirm that, if not tell us what it was? And then the question would be for Jayshree and the rest of the team.  Jayshree, can you talk about your entry into these various ancillary markets, whether fabric monitoring, automation, et cetera. I think you gave us the breakdown, which I appreciate, in terms of the contribution of revenue. But any thoughts on what type of growth? I suspect some news like fabric monitoring are coming off essentially for ground zero. You touched to the Big Switch acquisition, albeit I think that of presence would monitoring for a while now. But any sense you can give us for what type of growth you're looking at outside of data center switching with as much granularity as you can summit? Ita Brennan : Yes, Paul, just to close up on the Facebook. I mean, they were 16.6% of revenue last year. And obviously, they're down below 10% this year. So I think that gives you something to work with, right? Paul Silverstein : Okay. Jayshree Ullal : And Paul, as you know, the two types of software. There's the perpetual licenses, where we do some monitoring with what we call DANZ, Data Analyzer that's built in with our switches and routers. And then there's a subscription. So unlike many of our peers, we're not just converting perpetual into subscription. Our subscription-based software is really new markets, new markets like our Big Switch, DANZ monitoring, fabric, CloudVision, obviously, multi-cloud US router. And then we're very, very excited about the recent acquisition of Awake Security.  So the revenue will trail the subscription, but -- and we're obviously starting off a small number. So it would be remiss if we didn't grow double-digits on those small numbers. We expect to grow much faster than our 14% to 15% annual growth that Ita described. I believe we leave that when we show our execution. Paul Silverstein : Any thoughts on what that could be in dollar contribution? Jayshree Ullal : Well, what I did say is between A-Care Services, software renewals and all of these software, we expected it to be in the 25% range looking ahead. Paul Silverstein : Looking ahead. Jayshree Ullal : And again, I think it's important to think of that as trends, not exact revenue because revenue lags the bookings. Curtis McKee : Thank you, Paul. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just actually wanted to go off of Rod's question before. Appreciate the year-end disclosure, but I'm curious if you could actually talk about what did happen with your second largest historical customer on why it was cut by somewhere around 50%, even backing up the deferred haircut, it's still a pretty massive cut.  And related to this, it would imply that given the cloud vertical exposure that you had an uptick up, which I'm guessing was for Q4, not just the entire year, but that another large hyperscaler actually had has some strength underneath. So just kind of curious if you can walk us through the cloud titans vertical more specifically? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, James. First of all, our cloud titan verticals consist of only the major cloud scale customers, right? And we list them, but they are your usual suspects that you know. So we do have other cloud titan customers besides Microsoft and Facebook to clarify your question. Facebook, we've discussed a lot in the past. As you know, they had a change in their product line where they skipped the service cycle. And we saw the loss of that, especially in second -- late 2019 and also March of 2020. So we're looking forward to it coming back. Anshul, do you want to add anything more to that or? Anshul Sadana : That's it. We've been fairly transparent with what happened there on the CD cycle changes their plans for deployments and so on. And I think actually, everything rolled out, as we had stated almost four quarters ago. James Fish : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Thanks, guys and great quarter. So just maybe a quick follow-up on the supply disruptions. Can you provide more detail around sort of the nature of the disruption you experienced? And what I mean by that is, can you comment on sort of the magnitude of the impact in the quarter? What it might look like in the first quarter maybe the sector where you're seeing more of an exposure and maybe timing around your ability to recover those lost sales? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think, look, it's more of an extended lead time environment than it is anything else, right? And we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we're not losing business, right, that we're actually planning carefully with them and prioritizing what's most important to them, right? So I think we had hoped, if we talked this time last quarter, we had hoped to see more of a recovery in the fourth quarter than we did just because we saw more COVID-related disruptions around -- we lost some manufacturing capacity on and off because of COVID activities in different locations. The supply chain, some of the suppliers into that supply chain, sell that as well, right? So it's just -- I don't know that it's that's different to where we have been. And as we head into Q1, I think we're in a similar position. So there's no great disruption to the numbers, I think, coming out of changes in that environment. We just didn't make maybe as much progress as we would have liked, right? So we're continuing to just stay close to customers and prioritize, but we're also trying to make sure we don't lose business as part of that. Jayshree Ullal : And I just want to acknowledge that the manufacturing team, led by John McCool is doing a really good job with Anshul's leadership. We're doing the best we can, but we haven't recovered. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Jayshree, you guys have strong results in enterprise, and that's good to see. But you did mention campus sales cycles are probably still a bit long. But when we focus on the overall data center part of enterprise, I just wanted to check, like how are you what are you seeing in terms of drivers of growth there? Is it more of a land next band with the existing customers? Or are you -- what momentum are you seeing in relation to new logos on the core data center part of the enterprise customer base? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Actually, Samik, that's a really good question. Many enterprise customers are looking at us as the thought leader on how they should proceed with their workloads in the cloud. So I think by virtue of being consultative with them, what we're finding is some workloads move to the cloud, but many of them end up creating more data center capability that they need for some of their premise workloads. So this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos. We had one of our best ever quarters on not only new customer logos, but million dollar customers. So you can imagine that wasn't just campus, and so there was a lot of data center in there. Samik Chatterjee : Perfect. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Fahad Najam : Thank you for taking my question. I had a big picture question on architectures. We often hear from the cloud hyperscale operators talking about 800 gig and using silicon photonics to expand the search Redi in order to reduce the number of layers in their data center network. How should we think about that impacting your revenue outlook from your hyperscale customers? Should they achieve expanding the Radi architecture that you're talking about today? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Just before I hand it to Anshul, he's perfect to answer this. We believe Arista is number one today in both 100-gig and 400-gig, including 200, right? And the 100-gig market is easily 40 times bigger than the 400-gig. And anybody planning 800-gig is typically doing so in a much longer term, especially for optics, right? So in general, if you just step back and look at 400-gig, the calls have shifted out by a year, and we expect production mainly in the second half. So we're still in the world of 100, 200 and 400-gig, I believe, this year. But Ansul, do you have some more? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely. Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion, because this is not something that's going to happen in the next one or two years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their to larger clusters, which results in adding layer. And as a result of that, we have a balanced that as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to Save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions as we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, the 400-gig cord to 100-gig SerDes. Some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the end, this really hits, it may be when 224 gigs ears come out, that's at least six years out, maybe five. It's very hard to predict that. And that's when I think you'll see some of these changes. Jayshree Ullal : That's very visionary. Thank you, Anshul. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see, if you could touch on the routing use cases. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the expansion of feature set. And I appreciate that there's a bit of a spectrum between switching and routing. But if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of the revenue that this is contributing as well as your outlook for the growth in these maybe wide area network and routing functional cases within your data center deployments? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Simon, I think, as you know, this is a very important part of our adjacency. And I would sort of describe our success in routing in three areas. There are very specific use cases in service providers. We were doing very well, especially with routing and residential edge and bringing that edge capability for mobile edge or EBP and edge, et cetera. Then there's a second, which is an extension of our data center where we go into peering points, and these could be cloud providers, but they could also be enterprises in conjunction with service providers. And then there's a third, which is building the Telco cloud itself, where many people are looking \u2013 many customers are looking to build the same cloud-like principles inside their service provider network. Anshul, do you want to add something more to that? Anshul Sadana : Just it's pretty much so everything else at the data center, the cloud connecting to the backbone, backbone to the Internet, the Internet connecting to pivot points and then to the service providers and DS customers. I think we're actually doing fairly well, marching along that journey. There's a lot that has been done. There's still a lot more to be done, but I think we do very well keep growing in that space. Simon Leopold : Any quantification you can offer? Jayshree Ullal : As we said in the opening remarks, our goal is, together with campus for this adjacent sector to be 10% to 15% of our business, looking forward. And also remember, we struggled a little bit with how to count routing. So we try to be very disciplined about counting routing only when there's routing. So if it's combined with switching, it still goes into core. Simon Leopold : Thanks for that. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter. I apologize to go back to this, but in the context of kind of your guidance and the discussion around your second largest customer, I'm just curious how you thought about the move to this next-generation server cycle with Ice Lake and AMDs, Milan, and also in the context of that second largest customer, giving a CapEx guide, that looks like it's up about 40% year-over-year. How did you factor that into your outlook commentary for the full year? Or is that something that you consider, ' Hey, let's see if this CapEx guide comes to fruition and I'd rather take a conservative view on how that filters into the Arista business. Just curious how you thought about that? Jayshree Ullal : Aaron, I think that's an excellent question. Given we got burned the last time, on some of the forecasts, and we do think that we are going to take a much more pragmatic view. And our view is really that it's a multiyear spend, not just in 2021. So there's clearly going to be some good CapEx improvements from 2020 to 2021 specifically, but we're not counting at all for this year. Aaron Rakers : Just to be clear, remind me again of how your business trails kind of server cycle again? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. That's a good question. Anshul, why don't you describe that? Anshul Sadana : Aaron, what I would say here is, do not try to correlate us short-term to any cloud titan spend because they can spend their CapEx in many different ways. And it's only correlated to our business in the long-term, never in the short term. Jayshree Ullal : And typically, there's a lag of a few quarters, right? So the CapEx can be building, cooling, air conditioning, server storage before we think of the network. Aaron Rakers : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. I just wonder if I could. Could you talk a little bit about when we're starting to think about these adjacencies and the service and software lines, how are you thinking about getting to those growth out of those areas and those splits of the business that you talked about as far as kind of cross-selling the core portfolio and the existing customers, I would assume switch to routing is pretty synergistic. But could you talk a little bit about how much you're expecting to cross-sell into new Canvas customers, new software customers or what might -- just might be some new growth areas outside of where the core products are really strong? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, Tim, that's a really good question. I think we will rely very much on our sales force and our strength with our existing customers to achieve adjacency in campus. And the same is true for routing as well. It's a very natural way to go because it's a directed sale for large big bets and segments of customers. However, we will complement that so while on adjacencies will rely on our 7,000 or more customers. In the case of campus, we're spending a lot of time and energy on how to augment that with channels and partner distribution. And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected. So Anshul and the team are putting a fair amount of effort on not really just hiring salespeople, but creating systems engineering expertise. So building that expertise for DMS, building that for a week is an important aspect because often, they may be the same customer, but they may be a different decision maker. So that go-to-market is a little more nuanced for the software and subscription, but somewhat similar for the adjacency. Tim Long : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Thank you very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the emergence of codes infrastructure, the CI/CD pipelining of micro services, edge compute and how that's going to change traffic patterns and purchasing of your products over time, and particularly around the implication of the service mesh at the edge. I would think that -- you've been talking about points in the cloud in places in the cloud for a really long time.  And this architectural change effectively makes individuals and applications simply points in the cloud if we play out that strategy. And therefore, data and IT protection becomes critical. So how are you thinking about those aspects of the emergence and adoption of Kubernetes, micro-services, CI/CD pipeline and the like impacting your business? Jayshree Ullal : I don't know if Ken is still on the line to address this in more detail. But I think, in general, we believe a data-driven network coming to the Edge, whether the sources are multi-cloud, wireless, 4G, 5G. WAN, Kubernetes, et cetera, is very relevant to the way we develop our software. Ken, you want to add a little more? Kenneth Duda : Yes. Sure. No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways. The first is what's required for that whole computing model for scaling out your application horizontally across Kubernetes is a uniform physical networking fabric. You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes clusters are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute.  Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons belong to same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well. And so there's a need to have this same sort of repeatable rollout process of the underlying infrastructure for those Kubernetes-based environments, whether it's on-prem, edge compute or in the cloud. And that's what we've achieved with CloudVision studios. So I don't know if we've talked about this much in the context of the earnings call.  But CloudVision studios enables us to -- enabled our customers to create automation frameworks, so they can easily spin up new fabric deployments, new pods and absolutely with supporting Kubernetes in mind. Jayshree Ullal : And this is probably a great topic for Analyst Day, Alex, but stay tuned for more here. Alex Henderson : I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open. Jon Lopez : Thank you so much. Ita, I was wondering if you could just talk a second about deferred. The short-term and deferred was like really, really strong, best in multiple years. And I'm wondering what was in that, whether or wake had any influence on that? And then I think within that, you talked about perhaps some product deferred in there. And I was just wondering if you could talk to us about maybe when that layers in, so we don't get tripped up, which happened a couple of years back. So sorry for that, but can you just maybe discuss all those things quickly? Ita Brennan : I mean the driver in the uptick in Q4 was really around services and services renewals, right? I mean Q4 is a big typically a fairly large renewal quarter, and we had some larger customers renew prior period renewals of services. That's by far the biggest driver. There's a little bit of product, but it is small. Just pure new customer, new product stuff, but that's a much, much smaller part of it, right? It's really more services and the services. Jayshree Ullal : And Awake is too small and too early to call that number. Ita Brennan : Yes. Jon Lopez : Got you. Okay. Thanks for the help. Ita Brennan : Thanks, John. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter : Thank you. Thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted if you your thoughts on how you see customers deploying 400-gig? And do you think there's an opportunity to upgrade some of the 100-gig installed base to 400-gig in the early stages? Or will much of the initial 400-gig ramp be coming from net new port growth? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think, George, I've always said this, there's a strong correlation, especially with our cloud customers on 100-gig and 400-gig being tied as we move to a 400-gig spine, you still need a lot of 100-gig tributaries. And in the past, that besides COVID, we haven't had effective available optics. I think all of that is shifted 400-gig by a year, but this is a year we really see 400-gig will be deployed, especially in the second half. Just to give this in context, while we have over 7,000 customers, we have about 75 customers already deploying 400-gig in some fashion. So it's about 1% or less than 1% of our aggregate base, and so 100-gig will continue to be relevant as we augment with 400-gig, both in our high-end cloud and enterprise and service providers. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Could you address a little bit more about the recurring software and service revenue opportunity? Specifically, I'd be interested in what types of customers and verticals do you see as really driving that transition? Do you have opportunities to gain traction there with your hyperscale accounts? And then Ita, any high-level thoughts on contract terms, average length or invoice methodology would be helpful. Thanks. Ita Brennan : Sure, Ben. I think the biggest and most attractive verticals for the software subscription would be enterprises and financials. I love to get it into others as well, but these would be the two big areas of target. And there's clearly a lot of verticals in there, sub verticals, and we're already seeing a lot of interest in the financial markets for that software and subscription, and I expect we'll see many more. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And a lot of this is built upfront, and it's a two to three-year type kind of term contract term, if you like, and usually, we're collecting kind of -- we're billing and collecting cash upfront so far. I mean, that may change over time, depending on the size of the customer. But so far, that's kind of been the model. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup Research. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. And my sincere granulation on good results and outlook. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Jim Suva : In your prepared remarks, I think I heard some numbers thrown out like 36%, 36%, 28%. And I think that was for the vertical mixes Was that more for the year out or all long, long-term and the reason I'm asking the question is, is your guidance of, I think you said, up 12% for next year, and it's off easy comp. I'm just trying to figure out which of those three markets you're seeing the most strength? Because if I look at those percents, it almost seems like it's a lot coming from service providers, but maybe I'm bridging that incorrectly. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Jim, thank you for the good wishes. So the trends are not exact revenue for Q4, but it is our best indicator of how we think the year ahead will roll out. So we'll keep updating it every quarter to give you an idea of not how it's rolling out, but how it's actually turning out. So there is three sectors in that, right? The first sector is cloud titans, because it's big enough. You just have to look at that number, individual of others. The second is enterprise and financials together, which is the other 36; and the third is specialty cloud and service providers together. So if you look at Q4, we believe all of the three sectors contributed strongly to the number. And if you look ahead, obviously, as Anshul has pointed out, the cloud titans are vital to our growth, but they're operating off a large base. So we should be able to grow faster in the other sectors and still carry a large number in cloud titans. Jim Suva : Thank you for the details and congratulations. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you so much. Charles Yager : Thanks, Jim. This concludes the Arista Q4 2020 earnings call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis McKee, AVP, Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin. Curtis McKee : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results of the fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2021. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks\u2019 management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2021 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2021 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and product innovation, and the benefits of recent acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.  These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you are all being safe and vaccinated in these pandemic times. At Arista, we are especially deeply concerned by the heightened COVID crisis in India. We are taking steps to assist our local teams as best we can and know. Back to Q1 2021 specifics, we delivered revenues of $667.6 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. A-Care services, EOS renewals, and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.7% was influenced by software and services mix, as well as higher enterprise and Cloud Titan contributions for the quarter. We continue to experience good customer traction and growth with new customer logos and increasing million-dollar customers in the enterprises. In the quarter, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical; Enterprise was a close second; followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third place; and service providers at fourth place. International contribution was 25%, and the Americas were at 75% in the quarter. In terms of sector and product trends, we will report the specifics annually. They are consistent with the ranges we have already provided in our Investor Relations deck. To reiterate, our Cloud Titans are in the 35% to 39% range, the Enterprises are in the 35% to 39% range also, and the providers in the 25% to 30% range. Our product line forecast annually is expected to be 60% to 65% for core data center, 10% to 15% for adjacent campus and routing, and 20% to 25% for software and services. In light of the industry-wide chip and supply chain shortages, I'd like to shed more light on this topic, especially as it pertains to Arista. First and foremost, we are pleased with the healthy demand we are experiencing, and Arista is resonating well with customers and prospects as they are driving our multi-year growth projections. We share a preferred status with many of our top 100 and more customers and work intimately with them. However, the supply chain has never been so constrained in Arista history. To put this in perspective, we now have to plan for many components with 52-week lead time. COVID has resulted in substrate and wafer shortages and reduced assembly capacity. Our contract manufacturers have experienced significant volatility due to country specific COVID orders. Naturally, we're working more closely with our strategic suppliers to improve planning and delivery. Customer demand and visibility though has improved in the past few months. We are working with our customers to understand the timing of their deployment needs. We do not believe at this time that our customers are pre-ordering. However, we do think they\u2019re exercising prudent planning for second half of 2021 and even into 2022. But this is a backdrop; we believe supply chain will remain a pain point for the balance of this year as a result of all these shortages. Therefore, Arista is taking decisive steps to invest and increase inventory and manufacturing capacity. I often ask my customers, especially risk-averse enterprises, chose Arista. Arista\u2019s recent enterprise momentum spans many vertical markets, and includes a suite of data center, campus, routing, and software products. Our customers are aligned with our software-driven, data-centric approach to building their cloud architecture, their cloud operations, and their cloud experience. A key part of our enterprise traction is addressing the CIO\u2019s pain points to build a cloud-first and a data-driven network, spanning clients to cloud networking. Historically, disparate functions and data sets into routers, security, switches, and network management functions can now be integrated by Arista into a seamless network architecture with programmability, state, and AI-driven characteristics. Let me try to illustrate a few enterprise examples to highlight this. Our recent data center customer win was in the hospitality sector. They chose us because of our single EOS software image across multiple leaf and spine platforms. Using CloudVision for automation, for zero touch provisioning, easy upgrades, telemetry and compliance was only feasible because of Arista. Arista\u2019s deep buffer spine switches also enhanced their availability.  A second example is in the international retail customer for data center and routing application. A million-dollar customer, this was based on EVPN and VXLAN modern leaf-spine design, and once again leveraged CloudVision and EOS for improved automation, programmability, and change control. NetOps vs DevOps automation with Ansible integration was another key deliverable for their distribution center. A third to enterprise win was in campus in Europe. The 720XP is differentiated as a POE platform with multi-gig capability across campus workspaces for both chassis and 1RU form factors. The 7050 CX spine and spline brought low power, low footprint, and high density as an alternative to the chassis. The campus customer also implemented unified wired and Wi-Fi cognitive capabilities and this played a key role. Migrating from manual operations, once again, CloudVision with streaming telemetry was a key factor. In all these three examples, there were some common themes. The customer was very fatigued with legacy issues and embraced our U.S. software and our CloudVision as key differentiators and advantages. They also have much confidence in Arista\u2019s support, quality, and continued innovation. They embraced our strategy and build upon our differentiated state-driven and programmable software foundation to deliver our cognitive five-A's of agility, availability, analytics, automation, and AI and API-driven architectures. Switching to a popular Cloud Titans. We are pleased to also state that we now see increased visibility across 10-gig, sorry, 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gig demand from our Cloud Titan customers. While this business can be volatile, we have enjoyed a preferred partnership status, with many of them deploying us in diverse used cases and deployment consistent with the overall CapEx reported recently. I'd like to invite Anshul, our Chief Operating Officer, to elaborate more on this. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. We are driving next-generation cloud networking architectures for compute, storage, AI, data center interconnect, and WAN. These designs continue to improve resiliency, scale, and operational efficiencies for our customers. The much talked about 400-gig upgrade cycles, or as we have been seeing the next-gen 100, 200, and 400-gig upgrade cycle, is expected to start second half of this year. The availability of ZR optics, MACsec encryption, and software features to monitor these optical links is also well-aligned in this timeframe. While our customers have always wanted multi-vendor environments, we remain their preferred partner and continue to get our fair share. Demand for our products in the Cloud Titan segment is healthier than what we expected a quarter ago. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. Well said. And so for all the reasons Anshul just mentioned, we are more constructive on the Cloud Titan demand in the second half of 2021, although shipments may trail due to our increased lead time. So, in summary, our client to cloud networking strategy unifies siloed data sets consistently. We are at the cusp of a network transformation, resulting in growth and diversification across both market sectors and product lines in the future. I will now pass it over to our CFO, Ita Brennan for more financial specifics. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were 667.6 million, up 27.6% year-over-year, and well above the upper end of our guidance of 630 million to 650 million. Shipments remain somewhat constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain constraints and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of revenue in the first quarter. International revenue for the quarter came in at 165.7 million, or 25% of total revenue, down slightly from 26% in the fourth quarter. This shift in geographical mix was largely due to the location of deployments by our larger Cloud Titan and specialty cloud customers. Overall gross margin in Q1 was 64.7%, above the mid-point of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a balanced customer mix for the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were 180.9 million or 27.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at 178.1 million. R&D spending came in at 110 million or 16.5% of revenue consistent with last quarter at 110.2 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was 59.5 million or 8.9% of revenue, up from 54.9 million last quarter with increased variable compensation and other headcount related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at 11.4 million or 1.7% of revenue, down from last quarter to approximately 13 million [affecting] normal fourth quarter compliance related activities. Our operating income for the quarter was 251.3 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable 1.6 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.4%. Other income and expense included 2 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amount. This resulted in net income for the quarter of 198.8 million or 29.8% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.6 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.50, up approximately 23.8% from the prior year.  Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the year at approximately $3 billion. We repurchased $101 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $276 per share. As a reminder, we\u2019ve now repurchased $763 million or 3.6 million shares against our board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years, commencing in Q2 2019. We will continue to execute opportunities to be against the remaining mandate. Turning to operational cash performance for the first quarter, we generated 254.7 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. We had those come in at 51 days down from 55 days in Q4 affecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns are 1.8 times consistent with last quarter. Inventory increased 483.2 million in the quarter, up from 480 million in the prior period, as we continue to buffer certain components and products. Our total differed revenue balance was 720 million, up from 651 million in Q4. Approximately 40 million of this increase related to product deferred revenue with [acceptance clauses] for new products across various customers and sectors. The remainder of the increase in deferred revenue related to service renewal activity, and is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Looking forward, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded used cases with existing customers. These trends in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront in person testing may result in increased customer specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility and our product deferred revenue amount. Accounts payable days were 52 days down from 54 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 5.1 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We saw healthy demand across all of our market segments in the first quarter. These demand trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparisons continue to support an improving top line growth rate for the year. That said, we still expect some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through the year, given the top line recovery experienced in the second half of 2020. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. Turning to spending an investments, we remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. Finally, our outlook discussed above, and our guidance for Q2 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate any challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results, and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows, revenues of approximately 675 million to 695 million, gross margin of 63% to 55%, and operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 79.7 million. I'll now turn the call over to Curtis. Curtis? Curtis McKee : Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding and operator please take it away. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the rest of earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question and congratulations on such a solid quarter and guidepost. So, I wanted to just go back to something Anshul said regarding the expectations for hyperscale and call times better today than it was just three months ago. Anshul and maybe Jayshree, could you guys just walk us through, kind of what you saw from your customers, as far as planning, and build out plans to what helps you reach that conclusion? And was it broad-based across all major customers, or maybe two or three big standout or how much they want to bring offline? Anshul Sadana : Sure, Sami. For quite some time, there's been this talk about the 400-gig upgrade cycle and we've been saying for almost two years that it will take some time. And while we always knew it would be coming, now we can see customers doing the pilot runs and so on and getting ready for second half. So that's really what gives us the confidence. It's not much more than that. As Jayshree mentioned, there's plenty of issues on the supply chain side and so on that all customers have to work through as well. So, it's really more in the planning stages right now. But we certainly are feeling better than before. Jayshree Ullal : And I just want to add, Sami, that, Anshul and his team, make sure that our status with the Cloud Titans is not just a regular vendor. So, the emphasis on a preferred partnership and the intimacy on their deployments, their needs, the priority, the products, the used cases, the different permutations and combinations has allowed us to go from strength-to-strength, if you will. Curtis McKee : Right. Thanks, Sami. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes, thank you. First of all, I want to tell you Jayshree, the supply chain team deserves a raise. Jayshree Ullal : I\u2019ll take that under advisement, when I get the lead times down. Thank you. Jason Ader : But my question, I guess, is on the enterprise side of the business. And as you've ramped up your enterprise efforts over the last few years, what are some learnings that you've come away with? And where do you feel like you can do better maybe in a particular vertical or customer segment or geography? Jayshree Ullal : I think the learnings are two or three items. The first thing I would say is, it just takes longer. It's not instant gratification, like we've often had with Cloud providers or even early enterprise decision makers. So, investments we made two years ago are the fruit to the labors what we're seeing now. So that's one point. The second thing is, our product line is more diverse. Before, we were only selling data center, and the expansion from client-to-cloud, including our software products, our big switch DMS, our awake security, our routing our campus, most importantly, CloudVision, which is the epicenter of all their manual to automation, migration, I think has been a huge advantage because we really modernized the network. Until then they were measured, really, the migration was impossible, because it was all in silos, different operating systems. So, another big learning is the product line diversity, combined with the relationship we have formed over the last couple of years, I think, has been key. And in an odd sort of way, my third point would be COVID itself. COVID has been an equalizer for Arista, with dominant enterprise competitors. So, it has given our customers a chance to plan and think about alternatives. And I think we've had some advantage and disadvantage with that. The advantage is, they're more willing to work with Arista. The disadvantage is, they can't physically come and see us and do physical part that we've had to move more virtually. Curtis McKee : Great. Thank you, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Jayshree, I want to congratulate you personally on your new grandchild. Jayshree Ullal : Oh, thank you so much. He is about to hit\u2026 Paul Silverstein : Wishing you all much happiness. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Paul Silverstein : With respect to the business, can you give some more insight on the different customer markets? And going back to your cloud comments, was that still most, I assume Microsoft and Facebook are still dominant, but any insight you can share in terms of how much of the strength you're looking at? Or how much improvement is specific to those two? And how much of that improvement within Cloud Titans is also some of the other folks? And also with respect to your other customer segments, what are you seeing? Jayshree Ullal : Right. Okay. Anshul help me out here. Well, first of all, our Cloud Titan customer base is a very small sample size of five to seven customers, right? So the two you mentioned, Microsoft and Facebook, continue to be very relevant, very important. If we don't do well with them, the others can't quite make up the difference. So, you need to know that the intimacy with them, the strategic nature of our joint partnership is very important. And they definitely contributed in Q1. Having said that, Anshul and the team have been working with other Cloud Titans. They are getting healthier. And in Q1 and throughout 2021, we will fuel their contributions and design wins, specifically one or two of them. Anshul, you want to say anything more? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely, Jayshree. As we mentioned this call as well as previous ones, we're winning at multiple layers of the network. Inside the data center, as well as outside the data center, especially WAN and related areas for these customers as well. So that's giving us an opportunity to expand and grow beyond where we were. But having said that, instead of specific numbers, I think everyone should note that there are always uncertainties when multiple factors were related with upgrade cycles, including some we don't control at all, like the availability of optics. And all of you remember what happened in the 100-gig cycle. So, the comments are really that we are feeling better that all of the elements are adding up nicely to start the upgrade cycle and second half. Jayshree Ullal : Great. Thank you, Anshul. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you, and also a big congratulations to you and everyone there at Arista. You beat materially, I mean very, very materially on your sales and a lot of other companies are citing component shortages. So, you got the components, which is great. From the end market perspective or your verticals, which were the biggest? It was a cloud service-wide enterprise that really drove even above your expectations, the stronger sales, as well as the outlook? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Jim, thank you. And I really want to give kudos to Anshul, Chris Schmidt, Ashwin and the entire sales team for beating materially. We can only beat materially if we drive sales materially, and then of course we have to ship. One of the things you might have heard from Ita\u2019s statements is, all our five verticals performed very, very well in Q1. So they were all up. If I had to highlight which ones were up more, I would go by the ratings. I would say both Cloud Titans and Enterprise definitely made the contribution and made their mark. And especially, combined with the new logo acquisitions and increase in million-dollar customers, I think those two stood out, but all five were very good. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Fahad Najam : Thank you, Jayshree, for taking my question. In terms of any impact on the quarter from component shortages or were you able to ship 200% of your demand? That's a question mark and I have a follow-up. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think there's no doubt that we're facing the extended lead times, right. So, clearly, customers would like to have stuff sooner, and we would like to give it to them sooner. But we are facing extended lead time. So, I think it's hard to quantify that, which I know, everybody would like us to do. But I mean, we are definitely operating under a constrained, kind of supply environment with longer lead time. Fahad Najam : Alright. So my question on your improved visibility in Cloud Titans, if I'm not mistaking, your largest Cloud Titan customer, Microsoft is talking about building 50 to 100 data centers each year for the foreseeable future that\u2019s entering to 10 new countries this year alone. So, why is this kind of like slight, you know, [positive tone], why not a significant look from your Cloud Titan customer segment overall, given the substantial, you know, infrastructure build-out that you\u2019re talking about? I would be, you know, expecting [indiscernible] those orders or those trends slightly given the long lead times being shared with you, so, is improved visibility to quantify it? How much of an improved visibility you're seeing? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so Fahad, I'll take the question. Normally, we get one to two quarter visibility. This time, you're absolutely right. We now have visibility throughout 2021, perhaps some of that will even extend into 2022, right, Anshul. So, and it's exactly for the reasons you say that we now have a longer-term visibility that they have shared with us on their future plans. Now, having said that, as you know, we're not going to take that to the bank, there's still an awful lot of execution on their part and our parts to turn that visibility into actual results. They've got to build the data centers, they got to acquire the compute, the storage, the power, the cooling, you name it, and we got to also execute. So, while you're definitely detecting an optimistic tone and a more upbeat view, you never know things may change, but definitely, we feel like we have a better eye into more than the typical one to two quarters. Curtis McKee : Thanks Fahad. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Thank you, everyone for taking the question. And I just had a question about the supply chain and inventory. And if maybe we can dive in a little bit deeper. So, you know, obviously, if you look at your inventory position, it's basically flat sequentially. How do we interpret that in terms of your commentary that you're spending capital, you know, to improve manufacturing increase inventory, when we should be expecting a fairly meaningful rent in the second half of the year from some of the Cloud Titans? And does your inventory position sort of [indiscernible] getting into the guidance, give us a sense for where you think 3Q might be at this point? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so I think if you look at the inventory balance, kind of that they started at the beginning of the year and look at it kind of beginning of last year, all the way through Q1 of this year, I mean, it has been growing each quarter. And if you look at the mix of that, as you'd expect, the growth has been more in the components and the raw materials side. And then we've been using the finished goods, you know, pretty much as fast as we can, right. The other place that you'll see when we file the Q, you'll see purchase commitments are up to like 750 million at the end of Q1, which is as high as it's been significantly higher than what it's been historically and that's what's putting, you know, putting commitments on the table with various suppliers across the supply chain to make sure that supply comes in. So, we are kind of pushing on all fronts and being aggressive. These are new products. So they have a lower risk profile. We never say no risk, but they have a lower risk profile. But we are being aggressive in terms of, you know, funding, inventory and supply chain. David Vogt : And can you, Ita [indiscernible] can you tell us what the purchase commitment growth rate would be, sort of on a year-over-year basis before the Q was filed? What was it last year at plan? Do you have that data handy? Ita Brennan : Significantly lower. Yes. So, I think if you take a look at, I mean we\u2019re going to find it later today, so you'll see it. But we're \u2013 it's significantly higher. We haven't been in that realm historically. David Vogt : Understood. Thanks. We'll find it in [indiscernible]. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Last quarter, you were kind enough to indicate that you were comfortable with the consensus view that 2021 could grow 15%. That seems like a pretty low bar, and I'm not ignoring the comment you offered about deceleration in the back half of the year. But I would like to get an update because you certainly sound more roughly, we've had, you know, two quarters in terms of March and the June guide of high-20 growth. What are you thinking for the full-year at this point? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : So Simon, I\u2019ll let Ita answer the question, but we're definitely thinking it'll be higher than 15%. Ita Brennan : Right, right. I mean, I think Simon, you know, without trying to guide the year, every quarter, which is not kind of, you know, our normal practice. I mean, obviously, we've given you some upside in Q1, there's upside in the guide. You know, I think we can, you know, we continue to see some growth there. But don't forget the comparatives from, if you look on a year-over-year basis, I think you need to think about it more quarterly and sequentially in the quarters than trying to do it, kind of year-over-year from here on out, because there was a significant step up in revenue between Q2 2020 and Q3 2020. So just keep that in mind. But I think obviously, we've shown you some improvements. I think we're feeling better, but it's still an incremental quarterly growth rate as I think it\u2019s the right way to think about it. Simon Leopold : Just to clarify, other than the supply chain, are there other obstacles we should be considering when we think about seasonal patterns, sequential patterns? Ita Brennan : I mean, I think the supply chain is probably the biggest constraint, right? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think we've indicated that demand was healthy. So, if we could fulfill more of it, we would be feeling a lot better. Simon Leopold : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the Cloud Titans in just kind of the trajectory there in the quarter, we had detected, significantly improved, kind of orders that tend to project what your revenues are going to look like in March. So January and February, were sort of okay, but then March picked up quite a bit. So, I'm curious what your linearity was in terms of orders for Cloud Titans? And is that, you know, one of the things that gives you so much more confidence as you look into the back-end of the year? Jayshree Ullal : Rod, so, you know normally we would have experienced seasonality of Q1, right? But this Q1, we didn't have the seasonality nor did we have this linearity issues. We were pretty consistent in Cloud Titans or for that matter, our entire customer base, all verticals were linear January, February, and March. So, we felt pretty good, right? Maybe this is a post-COVID situation. But because there were no weather storms or impact of Chinese New Year or any of the normal things we have, we didn't have the normal seasonal issues in January and February. Rod Hall : [Indiscernible] for all the verticals? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Rod Hall : Okay. Yes, please Anshul, sorry. Anshul Sadana : Rod, as you know, the Cloud Titans are lumpy by nature. So, trying to measure them on a month-by-month basis just won't work. It really comes down to timing of when they want to deploy and so on. At this point, as Jayshree mentioned, it's much more tied to supply of products, and the way we ship them. So, I don't know what you are measuring, but that's certainly not how we saw it. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Hi. Jayshree, I just wanted to go back to the breadth of the portfolio that you\u2019ve talked about, particularly with enterprise customers, I know you've expanded the portfolio and generally you\u2019ve, like added campus, etcetera, you\u2019ve launched CloudVision into that market. I think the broader impression still remains that some of the other companies are like positioning themselves for the next generation enterprise network like SD WAN, there's some private companies talking about multi-cloud networking. So, just wanted to get your thoughts on where you are in terms of thinking about Arista\u2019s bread today in terms of the portfolio and potential expansion there? How much of that is organic, or how much do you see a need to kind of continue to expand though M&A? Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question Samik. Obviously, from Arista\u2019s perspective, we've gone from best of breed data center to a more complete enterprise portfolio, but that doesn't mean we play in every market segment or every space. Our focus has largely been on SD LAN, more than SD WAN for campus and data center to our, I would say, more of the medium-to-high end enterprise, right. So, where we're not building products today is more for the SMB, I would say that's first of all, an area we haven't focused on. So, if you think of our focus, we have DCI, we have multi-cloud. And I would even say we have WAN routing, which could be a, you know, form of regional SD WAN, and we'll continue to build on that. But in terms of SD WAN for the branch and [sassy] and SMB market will continue to partner with best of breed, whether it's VMware or Palo Alto, or you name it. So, we feel good that we have a very good rich portfolio for the high-end of the enterprise, and we\u2019ll complement that with the SMB portfolios of other companies. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryani : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really good quarter. You know, I guess the question I have is, when I look at your recent performance, it looks like you're sustaining really good top line growth, but you're doing better diversity versus just being Cloud Titan or switching driven, as it was in the past. So, I guess my question is really in two dynamics, A, inherently is selling software and security and routing, a more complicated operation than selling, switching? And do you need to alter anything internally on go to market or something to keep sustaining this product diversity? And then secondly, as you start selling more to enterprises and service providers, what do you think is the biggest challenge you have to overcome to get success in that space? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : All right, you got your two questions in. Thank you, Amit. So, yes, I would say once you \u2013 searching was hard too when we first got started, because we were a new vendor. But now that we have entered switching with good market share, our approach to selling software and routing is to enhance our switching platforms. So, it's not inherently harder, but it does take a different systems engineering and technical expertise. So, what we find ourselves doing in Ashwin and Anshul\u2019s organization is augmenting our switching expertise with more software and routing. And we have specialists for the big switch DANZ Monitoring Fabric, we\u2019ve specialists for the Awake network detection and response, we have specialists for routing. So, naturally, we need to build upon that switching foundation and add these layers of cake or icing, if you will. In terms of enterprise and service provider challenges, no doubt, as many, you know, we're the new kid on the block. And we have still best to breed there. And we're dealing with the incumbency of vendors who've been there easily 10 to 20 to 30 years longer. So, I would say our biggest challenge is breaking old habits. And I don't think we have any challenge showing our technical prowess. But being offered the opportunity to get there and overcoming the incumbency continues to be an important challenge. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. On a perhaps more prosaic nature, Ita for you. It seems though there are a couple of crosscurrents going on in the margin structure and that, you know, the enterprise mix, the qualitative mix may be changing a little bit components are tight and OpEx may come back a little bit with travel. So, I'm wondering if you could, sort of parse out for us, how you are balancing those and what we might expect to the extent you could share over the course of the year? Ita Brennan : Yes, no, I mean, I think we're executing pretty well to kind of the midpoint about 63 to 65, a little bit better, right? There are lots of moving pieces, obviously. There's no doubt we're still carrying some burden from whether it's COVID or supply constraints in the inventory numbers, and then in the P&L as we sell those inventories, right. So there is some burden there for sure. It's somewhat offset by the fact that we have the benefit on the OpEx side of lower, you know, travel, lower payments, marketing expenses, etcetera. So, I think we'll see both of those play out over time. And, you know, hopefully they're, kind of they\u2019re somewhat offsetting, right? So I think that's how to think about it in the short-term. I think the 63 to 65 is still a good range for growth margins, and, you know, we\u2019ll operate somewhere in the middle of that hopefully, as we go forward. Jeff Kvaal : And operating margins Ita? Ita Brennan : We've talked about this plus or minus 37%. So, I think that's still good, right? We're so used to that. And I think, again, there\u2019s moving pieces, but I think we feel good about staying in that range. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Jeff. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and very nice quarter ladies. Congrats. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Ittai Kidron : Good. Yes, thanks. I have a couple of questions. First of all, I wanted to make sure I, you can clarify the improved visibility on the cloud side. And what I mean by that is, whether this improved visibility is sort of flexion of the new projects, the design wizard that you've talked about, that require a little bit more forward planning or a reflection of the supply chain issues, meaning once those are resolved, you should expect visibility to shorten back down again? And then on the on the deeper side of it, going back to the question on SD WAN before, Jayshree, it seems like, you know, you talk a lot about automation and AI and monitoring and things like that, but security and networking are slowly blending on the edges as well. And you haven't talked really much if at all, about your plans and how you're going to attack the security landscape. And SD WAN, which is a clear networking side, you seem to be leaving that to security vendors, which is a little bit of a, I don't understand why you do that? Why would you do that? So, maybe you can, kind of give us a little bit of your thoughts on the security market? How relevant do you think that would be for the future of the company longer-term, perhaps not shorter-term, and is partnership the best way to play there? Is there no play that you can have in this market? Jayshree Ullal : Ittai, which question do you want me to answer? Ittai Kidron : All of them. Jayshree Ullal : We'll need an hour for that one. We'll do more on the callbacks. But to answer your specific question on Cloud Titans, definitely, Anshul and the team are very involved with the projects. And yes, those tend to be one to two quarters. But because of their long-term planning and our supply chain constraints, they both go hand-in-hand, they're making some CapEx decisions, and we have some supply constraints. We are getting beyond that two-quarter visibility to at least a year's visibility. So, I think you're absolutely right in saying it's going beyond the project one to two quarters to one-year because of supply constraints, and because of their long-term decision. On security, you know, we \u2013 I\u2019ll give you the short answer and there's a longer discussion, we will continue to partner with best of breed security vendors, number one. Our approach to zero trust networking, will really be holistic and network centric. And there's really three parts to it. One is, how do we provide the right network segmentation? We introduce the macro segmentation, how do we provide the right encryption capabilities of the DCI layer? This has been a huge differentiator for us in our data center products. So, how do we do the wireless intrusion protection, all of those are network related security. The secondary, I would largely call visibility or situational analysis. The combination of both the awake products, as well as the real time telemetry and streaming and big switch DANZ Monitoring Fabric really allows us to attack security from a visibility perspective. And the third is the proactive acquisition of Awake itself. We didn't acquire Awake, just to be a point security product. We really acquired it and Anshul and Rahul are working on this to make it a more seamless network and proactive network detection and response capability that's AI driven. So stay tuned, you'll hear more from us on that. But all of this basically is our zero trust, networking strategy different from our partnerships with firewall vendors, or cloud security vendors. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Curtis McKee : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Got it. Thanks. And maybe circling back on the Awake security, I guess, just, I wanted to ask, how is the integration of the acquisitions, whether it be a Big Switch or Awake going and just where are you seeing, kind of customer interest in some of the products that they had or integration within your portfolio? And just how should we think about that, kind of over the next year? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Meta, I think both Big Switch and Awake are very strategic acquisitions for us. And like all strategic acquisitions, they take time. Our goal and let me start with Big Switch first. You know, we were already building Data Analyzer or DANZ as we call it into our switching fabric. And with the Big Switch acquisition, we are now able to integrate more monitoring fabric capabilities, correlation, visualization, etcetera on our switches. We just introduced that recently. And you'll be seeing variants of that on different platforms, including the 7,050 and 7,280, towards the end of this year. So, the Big Switch integration is very strategic not only because of the monitoring capabilities, but because of the switch integration. On the Away side, I'm going to have Anshul talk more about it, but the team has done a fantastic job first of all, of really focusing in not just on the CSO, but on the CIO. You really have to target both decision makers. Anshul you want to say more about that? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely. With all acquisitions, you have to figure out how to integrate them based on the teams, the product go to market, and then the integration. And we have done fairly quick integration with Awake. There's more to do, but at least on the [indiscernible] market side, and so on, as Jayshree mentioned, there is a phase since I'm able to take this to the customer and take it to the networking team, to give them more visibility, and sometimes in collaboration with security to sell the product. So it's coming along, well. Obviously, we acquired Awake as a way small company, so there's more investments, more growth to come. But it's coming along well and faster than what we typically would have done in other situations. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Your line is open. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, guys, thank you for taking my question. I have a bit of maybe a nitty-gritty question, but I hear you talk about your supply constraints, and at the same time you beat your guide, and you guide above expectations. So, if you have supply constraints that get you to beat expectations every quarter, I'd really love to have you been constrained for, as long as possible. Jayshree Ullal : You mean, it's a nice problem to have if we have done. Pierre Ferragu : Exactly. I wouldn't call that like a supply constraint. I would call that like a [demon] problem. You have too much [demon] maybe. But anyway, my question is actually, that, how much visibility do you have to kind of keep operating, the way you're operating this quarter? And you're planning to upgrade next quarter fine? And when do you really get into trouble? If more capacity is not coming online? I just apply it because that's probably what I'm trying to figure out. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Pierre. It's a good question. And I would have to give you a more thoughtful answer over time. I guess if we were the only vendor with supply constraint issues, we would be in more trouble quickly because they'd have alternatives. But because this is an industry-wide shortage, I think we're all in deep trouble, including our customers who are trying to do the planning. So, I would tell you, we're on an equal footing. And we're all in bad shape on the supply constraints side, but not every one of us is in good shape on the demand side. So, we feel good about that. Pierre Ferragu : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter as well. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Aaron. Aaron Rakers : I want to go back to the deferred revenue discussion. You know, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you've got 40 million of product deferred that that's now built, I think it's been quite some time since we've seen any kind of product deferred kind of build into that deferred revenue buckets. So, how do you think about that in the concept of guidance? Are you expecting that to come into the revenue number, this next quarter over the next couple quarters? And then any comments on performance obligations that are outside of differed, what is that, how did that kind of expand? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So I think on the deferred, you know, it's always hard to forecast that kind of multiple quarters out. But I will say that we don't expect to kind of you know, that to come down in the second quarter, that's not an assumption for the Q2 guide, right. But I'm not necessarily in a position to start trying to guide that as multiple quarters out yet, but I think we do not expect it to come down. You know, it's a mix of customers across various sectors, but I think, you know, it's likely that we'll at least \u2013 have at least that level of deferred going forward. On the RPOs, I mean, we did some work in the Q, which you'll see later around the RPO disclosure and kind of, you know, consolidated a little bit so that you can see the pieces. You know, a lot of the movement is in deferred revenue between the product and the services. The other items didn't move that much, kind of quarter-over-quarter, but again, you'll see that and we've kind of consolidated some of those disclosures into a single footnote so that you can see it all together. So hopefully, that's easier to kind of, to process, but the non balance sheet if you like, RPO amounts are all around the services, services kind of on billed amounts, right. As opposed to kind of, you know build product or anything like that, which is in the deferred revenue. Aaron Rakers : Great. Thank you. Curtis McKee : Thanks Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I wanted to congratulate you about the quarter, but I'm not going to be unique, and I wanted to congratulate you about your grandchild, I'm not going to be unique. So, let\u2019s keep with the second one way more important. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Thank you. Tal Liani : I want to ask about enterprise data centers, one of the companies said that enterprises sweat their assets, their assets during 2020. And now they see the renewed momentum because there is kind of snap back in spending in data centers. And I'm wondering if you had the same kind of experience where corporates under spent last year, and now they just have to spend, they just have to modernize and add capacity, etcetera, etcetera or that other drivers drive data center enterprise data centers? Jayshree Ullal : Tal, as you know, enterprise data centers are much more of a long-term decision. So, I'm not sure they were so tied to last year or COVID, but they generally [slept] assets for three to five years, and then they're looking for a consolidation. And they're looking for upgrades to [100-gig or 400-gig]. And if anything, I would say was less tied to one-year, it was more tied to, you know, needing a cloud first strategy and figuring out which of their workloads go to the cloud, and which ones they invest in their premise. And so I would say it's more tied to that than anything specific to last year. So, bringing cloud principles into their data centers is probably the number one motivator. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I think I wanted to piggyback the prior question a little bit. Jayshree, you talked about COVID resulting in more planning from customers? Could you talk or share any thoughts about how that planning and return to work, maybe influencing the trajectory of your new customer wins? And then interested in you know, how you feel you're executing on the overall campus initiative? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, you know that's a good question Ben. I was surprised [Kansas] hadn't come up so far. So, I think what happened last year in COVID is everybody just froze and there was a period of time, nobody even knew how to deal with making decisions, right. Towards the second half of the year, we started seeing them engage in make decision making. And this year, many of them especially from a campus perspective, are looking at it much more as hybrid workspaces. Arista is doing the same. We don't see a full return to work of all our employees until it's safe to do so, but when it is safe to do so we don't see a 100% return either. Some of them will work here, especially Anshul\u2019s and John McCool\u2019s team that\u2019s very hardware intensive, but for example, Ken Duda\u2019s software team is very happy working in the different geographical locations remotely and may or may not come into work every day of the week.  So, we see the campus changing for a variety of reasons. It's moving from very distinct headquarters and regions and branches to a more fluid elastic set of workspaces where you have to provide wired, WiFi and equal access to multiple geographies. Whether you're at home or whether you're at work or whether you're in transit, you still have to do work. And that is influencing our campus decisions. Our enterprises are clearly very constructive on coming back to headquarters, but they're also very constructive on offering ubiquitous campus connectivity to their remote employees as well. As an example, in the retail space, even though we're not an SD WAN, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity on distribution centers, which are more regional and connected to these retail spaces. So, Arista is doing well in the campus. We're obviously operating our small numbers, and most of our well is in the high-end enterprises. So that's where I think we're having success. And we're marching to our targets. Where we are not doing well, or maybe not even focused, is, as I said, the SMB, which is more a distributed enterprise, a more channel driven enterprise, you got a lot of work to do there. And that hasn't been our area of focus, frankly. So, doing well in our target campus, and not doing much at all in our non-targets is what I'd say. Ben Bollin : Okay. Curtis McKee : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. Maybe Jayshree can you just update a little bit on what you're seeing from the white box community? Maybe a two-parter, are you seeing any move with new customers versus Tier 2 Cloud or SaaS companies trying to do a little bit more white boxing on the switching side? And then second, are you seeing any of the opposite trends where the traditional white box cut type of customers, maybe are going a little bit more branded for certain portions of their networks? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I know Anshul has some pretty strong views on white box, do you want to take that question? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Tim, there are two parts. One in terms of Tier 2 Cloud or SaaS companies and we haven't really seen any change in the white box scenarios in that part of the market. So, it's [fitting that] the white box are largely limited to the very large Cloud Titans in the United States or some in Asia. And it really hasn't changed beyond that. You may want to go back to all of the supply chain discussions we had. And just as an FYI, it applies equally to the white boxes as well. And in fact, many of the cloud companies are struggling through that because not every [ODM and Sun] are going to carry so much inventory and have large commitments.  So, the fact is, I'm shifting there. But leaving that aside, on our previous discussion on some of the larger cloud companies looking at going branded, we're doing well in our engineering projects in those opportunities. But as I've mentioned before, these things take a couple of years to materialize. So, please be patient. We feel very good about our execution and about the opportunity. But you have to give it time, let it bake in the labs, let it go to success and pilots. And when it's ready, and getting deployed, we will happily share the news with you as well. Jayshree Ullal : So, no change in [my part]. Anshul Sadana : No change. Status quo. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from George [indiscernible] with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m dialing in for Steve. I just [indiscernible] touched on the 400-g opportunity. What are your expectations in timing differences? I know you talked about second half of this [Technical Difficulty] 2022, do you expect that timing to differ between your major verticals? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, no, it's \u2013 I think the early adoption of 400-gig will definitely be in our Cloud Titans and our specialty Cloud providers, and some of our high-end enterprises, but I would say the first place you'd see them is the Cloud Titans. Curtis McKee : Thanks, George. Unidentified Analyst : And here's a quick follow up on the expectations on maybe like a lag for the adoption of enterprise, do you think it'll be [indiscernible] into 2022 and beyond? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I think the enterprises will take longer. Many of the enterprises are still adopting 100-gig. So, I think you'll see a combination of 100-gig and 400-gig start in 2022, but it could go well into 2023, 2024, and 2025 as well. Curtis McKee : All right. Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yes, thanks for taking the question. First off, Jayshree you said, you were on target for your \u2013 you\u2019re on track to hit targets for campus. Can you remind us does that mean that you're on track for 200 million in 2021? Then secondly, on that is okay. Anshul Sadana : The answer is, yes. Erik Suppiger : Very good. Thank you. And then on the 400-gig, can you remind us, are you still anticipating that you'll be the market share leader in 400-gig as that starts to ramp up or can you talk a little bit about some of the competitive dynamics, if anything has changed on that front? Anshul Sadana : Sure, Erik, this is Anshul. From a competitive standpoint, not much has changed, and our education is still very, very good customers are very happy. And the feedback for our products is good. The market share is the result of customers buying our products, not our forecast. So let the results speak for themselves. We feel good about our position. Curtis McKee : Alright, Eric, Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open. Jon Lopez : Hey, thanks so much. Excuse me. I have two sort of, not particularly interesting follow-up of some of these topics. The first one Ita, just you know service revenue has like very, very rarely declined quarter-to-quarter, it did so very marginally in this quarter, why is that and is there anything to extrapolate from that activity? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, no, I wouldn't try to draw any conclusions from that. It's really just timing of, you know, when you close renewal contracts and whether you bill in the quarter, and then there's some catch up or not, right. It doesn't change the fundamental at all right, so, I would. And typically Q4 is strong, Q1 can be a little lighter. I wouldn't try to read anything more than that into that, it\u2019s not a fundamental. Jon Lopez : Okay. Nope. That\u2019s perfect. I got you. And sorry, just the second real quick one. Just coming back to the, I guess the thing I want to explore is this concept of seasonality. So, forgetting the year-on-year for a second in admitting it's like kind of a wild data series, but you're generally between Q3 and Q4, up they call it high single digits, low double digit sequentially. Is what you're saying Ita that perhaps some of that activity has been pushed earlier into the year? Or are you not suggesting that and you're just more focused on the year-on-year trend, given the comps? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, no, I think I said that we did not experience the Q1 seasonality. That's all I said, given the pandemic, but other than that, I think the rest of the year, you know, will be based on demand and their feeling good about the demand. Ita Brennan : Yes, I think my only comment, Jon was around, you know, you're growing off a 523 in Q1, and then you know, you grew Q2 to Q3, you added like 60 million last year in revenue quarter-over-quarter. So, obviously, the comps get much harder in Q3, and Q4. That's the only reference. So the year-over-year growth rate is going to come down just naturally because of that. I think if you look at the quarter over quarter growth rate, that's an easier thing to kind of map out, right, if you're looking at it from a model perspective. Jon Lopez : That\u2019s it. Thanks so much for the help. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Your last question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Kyle] on for George, thanks for the question and fitting me in here. My main questions were on campus and 400-gig. So to avoid beating those to death, I\u2019ll ask a simple one. Do you have any expectation currently on when travel expenses would pick back up again? I know you said that they're currently out of the model, but you know, are you \u2013 do you have any plans on when they may turn back again? Or is it kind of a wait and see still? And how should we contemplate that in the [indiscernible] OpEx expectations? Jayshree Ullal : I mean, it wasn't huge. I mean, our kind of, you know, sales and marketing margin expenses around that are not huge to begin with. But I think it doesn't start to come back to later in the year. We'll update as we go. There's just a lot of moving pieces around that right now. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks very much. Curtis McKee : Okay. So, this concludes the Arista Q1 2021 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the investor section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and everyone, please continue to be safe. Operator : Thank you for joining ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yeager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin. Charles Yager : Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second-quarter ending June 30, 2021. If you'd like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website.  During the course of this conference call, Arista Network's management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2021 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2021 and beyond, our total addressable market, and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, product innovation, and the benefits of the acquisition, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Charles. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these post-pandemic times, especially with the resurgence of the Delta variant. I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome Liz Stein, our new Director of Investor Relations Advocacy, working closely with Charles. Liz is a long time Aristian with deep networking expertise and most recently ran our South-Central Region as the systems engineering manager. Welcome, Liz. Back to Q2 2021 specifics. We delivered revenues of 707.3 million for the quarter with a record non-GAAP Earnings per Share of $2.72, [A-Care] (ph) services and software renewals contributed approximately 22% of revenue. Our non-GAAP Gross margin of 55.2% was influenced by the enterprise momentum and software and services contribution. We are pleased with the healthy customer traction, including new customer logos and record million-dollar customers in the mainstream enterprises. In Q2 2021, Cloud Titans were our largest vertical. The enterprise was a close second, followed by financial and specialty cloud providers tied at third place and service provider at fourth place. The international contribution was strong at 27%, with the Americas at 73% for the quarter. We surpassed a accumulative of 50 million cloud networking ports shipments this quarter. And we consider this to be a key golden milestone. In light of the industry-wide supply chain shortages and escalating cost of components, freight and expedite logistics, I would like to invite John McCool, our Senior Vice President, and Chief Platform Officer, to shed some more light on our manufacturing execution. Welcome, John. John McCool : Thanks, Jayshree. The continued industry-wide impact of COVID on global supply chain output, combined with an increase in demand for electronics across all segments, is expected to remain for the foreseeable future. Component lead times are the highest we've seen and have roughly doubled from pre-pandemic norms. Most notable are semiconductor lead times, which have extended in the range of 40-60 weeks.  Factories are operating near full capacity, limiting flexibility for changes in demand. Therefore, we expect extended lead times and escalating product costs due to expedites and elevated component increases in 2021 and 2022. To mitigate these headwinds, we've taken a number of steps in Arista manufacturing. First, we improved manufacturing procedures to maximize capacity and material utilization. We are increasing our purchase commitments for 2022 forecasts to adjust for increased components lead times. We placed additional emphasis on inventory for our new products to offset supply constraints. Finally, we are working closely with our strategic suppliers to plan for capacity expansion programs. Clearly, we're redoubling our efforts and execution in this challenging macro environment. And look forward to supplying chain improvements in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, John. We really appreciate the diligent and disciplined work that you and the entire manufacturing team have stepped up to. We welcome Susan Hayes, your newest Vice-President of Manufacturing as a strong addition. We also thank our customers for their patience and understanding during our lead time constraints and will strive to keep doing better as we recover in the second half of 2022. Our enterprise customer momentum has never been stronger. Continuing on our theme of enterprise wins, I would like to share with you 3 examples of strength and success. The first win was in the retail sector for both data center and campus. We began with the data center win with Arista\u2019s hallmark EOS, for DANS or data analysis switching and routing. We expanded in 2021 the cognitive campus for both power over Ethernet wired switches and our wireless, providing a natural expansion into these use cases. Retail markets cannot tolerate downtime with the magnitude of IoT proliferation they have.  Arista was able to perform real-time upgrades without downtime across 100 plus stores and warehouses. In the absence of retail, remote staff [in hand] (ph) we drove automation across all these stores with open APIs and CloudVision. Our second win was a major U.S. financial for both data center and routing. Arista continues to expand its enterprise routing use cases, not just supporting with data center with Arista EOS features, but also a more software-led, simplified, automated deployment of core routing in the spine using standard-based routing protocols with VXLAN, EVPN, and Multicast.  Our customer was able to rapidly migrate from Legacy to Arista within a few months, enabling billions of transactions. An international media and entertainment campus win included a customer who wanted an extension of their data center in the campus with a simple operating system, easy to scale, common spine deployment using CloudVision. This customer took a build-as-you-go approach for flexibility and visibility. This also included device access for back-to-work applications with our cognitive Wi-Fi. In all of these three examples, enterprise customers often prefer an alternative, and Arista was chosen as the disruptor with superior product capability and a cohesive client-to-cloud strategy to unify SILO datasets consistently. Arista's innovations combined with high quality and support are becoming the gold standard for customers to build cognitive cloud networking. According to industry experts, Arista continues to gain switching market share across large enterprises and providers. We're proud to be the number 1 market leader in 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports for the fifth consecutive year.  We see 2021 as the first year of inflection for higher speeds, ranging from 100 to 200 to 400-gigabit after 18 months of trials. We have now shipped more than 2.5 million ports of high-performance port in the first half of 2021, according to analysts; placing us also at number 1 leadership in the combined 100-gig, 200-gig, and 400-gigabit ethernet high-performance cloud switching. In summary, Arista is well-positioned for the next phase of our growth in cloud and data-driven networking. We do this with proactive platforms, predictive operations, and a prescriptive experience. And we believe we are poised to achieve increasing market share with greater business diversification. And while the path forward is paved with supply chain obstacles, volatile customer demand, and your normal typical competitive tactics, I believe Arista, which means to be great in Greek, will live up to its name, and with our A-game, our A customers, and our A-team. With this, I'll pass it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer for financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree. And good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and includes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were 707.3 million up 30.8% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of 675 million to 695 million.  Shipments remain constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID -related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 22.3% of revenue in the second quarter, up from 21.4% in Q1. International revenues for the quarter came in at 193.2 million, or 27% of revenue, up from 25% in the first quarter. This shift in the geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis reflected strong international deployments by our Cloud Titan and specialty Cloud customers combined with a healthy performance from our in-region businesses. Overall gross margin in Q2 was 65.2%, above the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. While we recognized some incremental supply chain costs in the period, these were more than offset by a healthy mix of enterprise and software revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were 189.8 million or 26.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at 180.9 million. R&D spending came in at 119.6 million or 16.9% of revenue, up from last quarter at 110 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was 57.9 million or 8.2% of revenue, down from 59.5 million last quarter with lower demo related expenses in the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID -related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at 12.3 million or 1.7% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was 271.7 million or 38.4% of revenue. Other income and expenses for the quarter were a favorable 1.7 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 20.7%, reflecting an improved geographical mix. Other income and expenses for the quarter included approximately 2 million of interest income offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. This resulted in net income for the quarter of 216.8 million or 30.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.71 million shares resulted in a diluted earnings-per-share number for the quarter of $2.72 up approximately 29% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at approximately 3.3 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the second quarter.  As a recap, we have now repurchased $763 million or 3.6 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years, commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. Turning to operational cash performance for the second quarter. We generated 263 million of cash from operations in the period reflecting solid Net Income performance and continued investments in Inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 47 days, down from 51 days in Q1, affecting the linearity of billings in the period.  Inventory returns were 1.7 times, down slightly from last quarter at 1.8. Inventory increased to 543.2 million in the quarter, up from 483.2 million in the prior period, as we continue to buffer certain components and products. Our total deferred revenue balance was 746 million, up from 720 million in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services-related and is directly linked to the timing and term service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Approximately, 90 million of the balance, up from 70 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance clauses for new products across various customers and sectors.  As a reminder, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with the healthy new customer acquisition rate, and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront and price and testing may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility in our product deferred revenue amounts. Counts payable days were 53.7 days, up from 52.3 days in Q1, addressing the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Cabin expenditures for the quarter were 4.5 million. Now, turning to the outlook for the third quarter and beyond. We reported strong year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 29% for the first half of 2021, reflecting healthy demand across all our market sectors combined with favorable comparisons from the first half of 2020. While we expect continued strength in demand as we move through the second half, we will likely see some deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth, given the top-line recovery experienced in the back half of 2020. Turning to Gross margin. Industry supply constraints continue to pressure component costs. Some of these incremental costs will initially be recorded as Inventory and only be recognized in the Income statement when the products are sold in future periods. With this as context, we will continue to reiterate our Gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to spend and investments, we remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business, and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion.  With regards to cash flow, we expect to fund approximately 40 million of CapEx in the third quarter for the purchase of land to build a data center and engineering location in Santa Clara. We will provide more details of this project over the coming quarters. Finally, our outlook discussion discussed above, and our guidance for Q3 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This remains an inherently uncertain situation and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds.  With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the Third Quarter to base on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows. Revenues of approximately 725 million to 745 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin at approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles. Charles Yager : Thank you Ita. We're now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista Earnings Call. Due to time constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anita Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Anita Marshall : Great, thanks. I'm guessing there'll be a couple of questions on this today, but just -- if you could give a sense of -- if the supply chain constraints are worse in any portion of the portfolio. And then maybe as it relates to that where the inventory is. Just trying to get a sense of, is it on the high-speed products or more of the campus service provider portfolio? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Anita. I think just about every component is affected in our supply chain, I'll let John or Ita comment, but we're affected on chips, memory, copper, passive components, freight, logistics, expedite fees. I don't know if I can pinpoint; it affects all our products. And the lead times vary as you heard, they're all double so we've been experiencing anywhere from 20 weeks to 60 weeks or 40 weeks to 60 weeks, like you said, John, right? John McCool : Yes. Jayshree Ullal : Depending on the part, we are experiencing component levels of increase across the board, campus, routing, switching, data center, you name it. And they're at the component level. Now, we're going to try and absorb as much of it and offset as much of it as we can, and not pass it onto our customers if we can help it, except in modest levels. But I don't think it's anything more than across-the-board. Anita Marshall : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Anita. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thank you for taking my question. A competitor just recently noted, as you guys were talking about, that they're seeing some orders placed a little bit earlier suggesting that there has been a little bit of a pull up -- pull forward given the industry constraints. Can you guys just kind of explain a little bit how you're thinking about visibility relative to your order book and the backlog given the strength this quarter and the supply constraints? Does this lead to better visibility, obviously over the next, let's call it 2 to 3 months, and what does that mean for the fourth quarter without getting into specific guidance? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, David. As you know, we've always had limited visibility, but the last few quarters, I've noted that our visibility has gone up due to our lead time. So, I think there's a direct proportion to long lead times, slightly longer visibility. So particularly with the Cloud Titans that Anshul works closely with, we have been able to get visibility beyond the one to two quarters that we normally get.  And we do have visibility into 2022. And I think it's directly tied to them planning better and realizing that with longer lead times, they need to know what they're going to do in 2022 for us to supply the product. Anshul, do you want to add some more to that? Anshul Sadana : Yes, I would say we're not seeing order pull-ins or if customers doing it, they won't tell us. It's much more the non-binding demand signals we get is where the discussions happen with customers. That's how we get our visibility from them. Jayshree Ullal : It's just prudent planning, David, from a customer. David Vogt : Great. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question's really around the 400-gig opportunity. And I think the last couple of years you've spent a lot of time explaining to folks how your software stack is really differentiated against white-box risk. I would love to get your perspective as the underlying technology gets more complicated with 400-gig and 800-gig, what's the potential for Cloud Titans that have historically relied more on the white box to start talking to Arista? And I'd love to know if you're seeing a shift in customers that have skewed more white boxes and always build their own products, now looking to perhaps [buy] (ph). Anshul Sadana : Sure. The companies that visit on white boxes are fairly sophisticated, so they're not short on talent. If they are committed to a mission, they will go ahead with it. I don't believe if any changes happen in the industry, it will be simply because the next-gen is harder to boot. But it's much more about the collaboration we have with the vendor co-development partnership we have here. And we've talked about it in the past, and nothing has changed on that front. We are moving along on our mission. And the few situations where customers consider buying from the outside, that will take a few years to actually materialize. No big change here expected. Jayshree Ullal : Amit I think the way to think of this is if you want commodity 100-gig without our software stack, and you just want to buy basic vanilla stuff, you'll continue. But if you really appreciate our collaboration, our engineering, our innovation, and our software stack, then that's when Arista gets chosen. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to actually ask about the progression of the subscription of business within the model. As we look at the services line, is there any way or how we investors should start to think about that as being an increasingly visible growth driver for the Company? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Aaron. Thank you for the wishes. Wish we could ship more. I think the real issue to think of subscription is a long-term indicator of not necessarily just revenue, but the stickiness of our business, right? When you look at CloudVision -- Cloud U.S., what we are doing with network detection and response to an AI-driven security, or Big Switch acquisition with DANZ Monitoring Fabric. These are all, if you will, layered icing on the cake. And the icing contributes a good margin and obviously has a long-term one-year, or two-year, or three-year subscription so the revenue shows up a little bit later. But the bookings are very strong because you can imagine from that, so we'll continue to see strong software service renewals as well from our A-Care. And so, the two together, we believe we've always said, will be a 20% to 25% contributor to the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jayshree, you did comment starting off that you're seeing strong demand from enterprise customers. Wondering if you can just talk about what you're seeing from the other customer verticals like is demand accelerating. Similarly, for example, the Cloud Titans as well as some of the Telcos. And keeping that backdrop in mind, it does look like the third quarter guidance is for like a [full] (ph) percent increase when traditionally we've seen like a high-single-digit. So, should I just infer that's all supply-driven in terms of the moderation rates to historical trends? Jayshree Ullal : First of all, thank you. Historicals aside, I think all our five verticals are doing well. In that, I would highlight Cloud Titans and Enterprise is stronger, but that doesn't take away from the contribution and success we are having with Specialty Cloud financials or the service providers. I guess it's a case of rising tides raise everything, so all of them are contributing well. Relative to our Q3, demand is strong, wish we could ship more, but I wouldn't compare it necessarily to our last Q3 in the post-pandemic era, I would just say on the basis of large numbers, we're doing well. Ita Brennan : Yeah, I think if you look at last year, I mean, given the year that it was, you saw a very significant uptick in Q3, was up 12% or something quarter-over-quarter. That was just more of an a semblance of what was happening with COVID at the time. Jayshree Ullal : Right. And previous year [Indiscernible] like that. Ita Brennan : I think the Q3 guide, 20% -- 21% of the midpoint year-over-year, that's a good place to start. Yeah. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Fahad Najam : Thank you for taking my question. In terms of the pricing environment, can you comment on, are you planning on passing on any of the incremental costs that you're experiencing? Can you also talk about the dynamic you are seeing in the market in terms of pricing? Are your competitors increasing their pricing as well? Or are they using this as an opportunity to absorb the costs and maybe aggressively price? Maybe a comment there. I would appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : Well, Fahad, I'm not in a position to talk about competitors. Maybe they'll share that with you. They really don't with us. But I will say that we're going to try our best to absorb the costs. On selective models, we will have to where the increases are significant increase prices slightly, but we don't expect the impact on that on our backlog or existing Inventory. So, the real impact of any changes we make will impact our gross margin or our price changes next year. Fahad Najam : I appreciate the response. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thanks very much. I'm wondering -- you started to talk a little bit about a deceleration in the back half of the year, which makes complete sense. I'm wondering if there are any one-time tailwinds that you are expecting this year that we should be considering when we start to think about the shape of 2022. Obviously, you all don't want to talk too much about it, but anything that we should be considering as we have to think about it. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, I think it is a little early to start getting too specific about 2022. This year did have an unusual slope to it just because of the pandemic and how 2020 played out. We're putting up some very good numbers now this year, that's obviously setting a good base for us to grow off next year. Bear that in mind, but the business is solid, it's strong demand. I think we're executing well and it's broader; it's across the verticals. We'll probably take a shot at giving you some book ends next quarter for 2022, but it's just a little too early yet. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you, Ita. Operator : Your next question comes from -- Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jeff. And nice job Anshul, Chris, and the whole team for creating demand. Anshul Sadana : Thanks, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. A clarification and question. Jayshree, did I hear you, or were you to say that you're expecting 20% growth now for the top line for the year? Ita Brennan : No, you did not hear her say that. Jayshree Ullal : Obviously, I would never say those things, Paul, but Ita what did you say? Ita Brennan : We talked about the midpoint of the guidance for Q3 year-over-year growth. Paul Silverstein : Let me ask -- let me ask a question because last quarter, I think you -- you responded in response to a question, you said for this year, you're definitely expecting 15% growth for the year. That was in the Q&A. Any thoughts on what you're expecting now for the year? And can you also comment on how much the supply chain is costing you in revenue and in margin structure? Ita Brennan : I think for the year now when you layer in Q3 and you think about Q4, you can probably get to a reasonable view of the year. I don't know that we want to put a specific number on it, but you can get there. Once we give you the Q3 number, it becomes a lot easier. In terms of how much, clearly, lead times are very extended, it's always hard to compare that to some kind of normal world. We can obviously do more revenue if lead times weren't that extended; how much -- it's really hard to put a number on it, I don't think we're going to try to put a number on that. Paul Silverstein : All right, given that response, can I ask you within Cloud Titans since historically, you've been highly concentrated in Microsoft and Facebook. But of more recent vintage, you prove you having some more success with some of those folks, I think Google in particular. Any insight you can share with us? Jayshree Ullal : I think Paul, you summarized it very well. Actually, the team is doing a great job in both diversifications across all our sectors. And while Microsoft and Facebook are very strategic, very important customers, we have other Cloud Stack and customers also. Anshul Sadana : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. A little just a clarification on just Ita's commentary regarding the second half deceleration. Now, Ita, I was hoping you'd give us some sequential guidance. Is there any potential that sequential growth could be negative in 3Q and 4Q? And if I just extrapolated out and I forecast a little bit out from where we are today, and even out of balance, we're getting into the low 20% range. I just want to clarify if there would be any sequential decline in 2021? Ita Brennan : Yes. We've given you Q3 at the midpoint and there's clearly growth their quarter-over-quarter. Again, we're not trying to guide too far, but Q4 is usually a good -- a good strong quarter. So, I leave you to draw your own conclusions from that, but I think we've pretty much laid it out for the year. Jayshree Ullal : Sami, I think the message we'd really like to convey is demand is strong; we're doing well. We need to execute on our shipments and we can only approach this -- our shipments one quarter at a time because our supply chain is so constrained. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to ask you about the gross margin guidance. We -- when we were talking to Cisco on a similar note, they had said that the supplies impact on their gross margins were bottoming, or on their margins was bottoming in their guide. And I'm curious whether this guide for September, from your point of view, is at the bottom? In other words, gross margin at least goes sideways from there, or do you think it's unknown at this point and things could continue to worsen? That's my first question. I have a follow-up. Ita Brennan : Yeah, I think Rod, on the supply chain stuff, we did have some significant supply chain impacts even in Q2, it just was more than offset by the customer mix. But I think as we look forward, we are paying more for certain components that's better than normal and that cost will get recognized whenever we ship those components and the products that are in those -- those components are incorporated into.  So, we will see some drag on gross margin probably for some time just given the inventory and purchase commitment levels that we have. We are -- that mix is healthier. The enterprise mix is helping to offset that, but customer mix is still by far the biggest driver. So, if we have a quarter where there's a heavy cloud mix you are going to see pressure on that gross margin number for the quarter, but I think over time we feel like we can stay in that 63% to 65% range. And that's a good, safe place to be. Rod Hall : I guess what I'm thinking is, you\u2019re already signaling some pressure in 64 -- in the next quarter because that's down over a percent from this quarter. And I'm wondering, do you -- when you say that, do you think it's probable that you have a materially lower margin than 64, or do you think when you say dragged, do you mean 64 is a possibility for longer? Ita Brennan : Yeah, again I think the biggest driver will be the customer mix. On a quarter where there's heavy customer mix, you could be back at 64, you could even be below that. But again, it will be because of a particular mix in a particular quarter, so I think the range is still very valid. The 52 plus -- the 65 plus that we saw this quarter is a really good, solid enterprise mix that's helping to offset some stuff. You will see -- gross margin is going to move around a bit over time, but I think we're still very comfortable in that range. Jayshree Ullal : As Ita said, Rod -- Rod Hall : Okay. Jayshree Ullal : As Ita said, a lot of our inventory costs will be realized later and -- this year and next year. The gross margin would actually be more pressured when that higher cost is realized. And so, then if we have a really good enterprise mix, we could be on the better side of 63 to 65. If we have a high cloud mix, then I don't rule out the possibility of being on the lower side of 63 to 65, right? Recognizing that the costs are really -- Rod Hall : Yeah, makes sense. Jayshree Ullal : -- really going to enter. And nobody is predicting the semiconductor supply costs of shortages are going away in 2022. Rod Hall : No, absolutely not. And then that leads me to the enterprise trajectory -- the enterprise spending indicators are very strong here as we look into the second half. Just curious, what are your thoughts on the enterprise pipeline or I mean, does that look equally strong in your pipeline, or how does that look to you? Jayshree Ullal : Rod, I think you've run out of questions, but the short answer is yes. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Jason Ader : HI, guys. My question is for Jayshree. How does this supply chain situation compare to prior periods in your career where you've seen supply constraints? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I\u2019m glad you're asking the oldest person here, close to the oldest. In my career of several decades, I\u2019ve never seen it be dispersed. Never. This is the worst I've seen it. And there have been some pretty big ups and downs. And more than the worst I've ever seen it, I think it's also going to be prolonged. I guess we're all hopeful, we will all recover from the COVID pandemic. But everything from copper shortages to wafer starts to assembly to manpower, people, logistics, freight. Just about every aspect of it is challenged, too. Anshul, do you want to add anything more to that as the youngest person here? Anshul Sadana : I just said things are very constrained, but I think what's happened is the world supply chain never planned for this big mismatch in supply and demand. And as a result, when you run into a crunch, people try to book ahead and plan to [Indiscernible] offers and so on. But this is not an industry where you can react in one quarter. The -- this will last a long time to [Indiscernible] industry predicting maybe recovery in 2023 but who knows what demand will be at that time? Could be in it and prepared for a longer run. Jason Ader : And is it inevitable that at some point we're going to see a demand air pocket, Jayshree, just because everyone will have ordered what they needed ahead of time and we'll hit some type of air pocket? Jayshree Ullal : I don't know the answer to that, Jason, but I think given the business diversification we have, the planning of one type of customer will not affect the planning of others. So, I'm hoping that some of them are planning for 2022 and some are planning for ahead in 2023. And so, the air pockets will balance off, if you will. Ita Brennan : And the visibility, Jason, I think to what the demand is for and when it will get deployed, at least for the larger customers its pretty good, so that helps. It's not -- you're not -- you're deploying over time filled; right? Jayshree Ullal : That's right. It's very much, as Ita says, a-land-and - expand situation. You don't just land and then buy nothing from a long time. Jason Ader : Very good. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : And thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment. Jim Suva : Thank you. And I only have one question and that's related to your strength in revenues that you've just seen and kind of the outlook, that strength. Is it being driven across all your end markets, or are there one or two that you really want to call out to us as if you were to look back, say six or nine months ago, you would not have guessed it would have been so strong because you really have posted really impressive results and a great outlook? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. And again, a lot of credit goes to Anshul and his team. Anshul, I would love for you to answer this question, but let me just preface it by saying, all five verticals are very strong. They're all growing double-digits. And it's -- in fact, I feel bad rating any of them as second or third or fourth or fifth place. But if you ask me what I'm most positively surprised by, you might remember a year ago, Jim, we were less bullish on the Cloud Titans. We thought they would even be flat to down. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Well, what a difference a year makes over the, despite the COVID impacts? But the Cloud Titans is serving a strong upgrade cycle at 400-gig and planning their transitions. And not just 400, but mix of 100,200,400. And the customers themselves are surprised that the end demand is so strong for their businesses.  That's been a good upside for us, and famous super enterprise. We've talked about enterprise for quite some time. But we're quite happy with the adoption by our customers, both in our primary deals in the market growth, also expand into campus, into monitoring into facility. And we have a long way to go. It's a very the large time, and we're just getting started there, so that keeps us very positive on the growth in that area too. Jim Suva : Thank you, and congratulations. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. At the beginning of July, the U.S. government announced the cancellation of the Jedi project with a plan to put it out for rebid. I'm just wondering how you would factor that into your own forecasting and modeling given that you sell into one of the essentially participants in that project. Does this change your thoughts on this year and longer-term? What do you do in terms of a project when it comes to forecasting your overall business? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Simon. I don't think we've really factored it in very much except making sure we had all the certifications. You want to add to that more, Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Simon, this is a contract award 10-years. It's not as if we saw any significant change in the last year related to that. In addition, the contract -- the Jedi program might be gone, but there's so many other programs the government is doing with [Indiscernible] companies. So, it just gets mixed into the noise. We don't really see -- we never saw any big upside s. I don't think there's any big downside either. Simon Leopold : How big is government typically for you? Anshul Sadana : No, but in this case, this wasn't going through us. This was going through one of our cloud customers, which is why we don't see it direct. Jayshree Ullal : It's not really government. It's Cloud Titan. Simon Leopold : Yeah. No, but it -- I guess in general because government sounds like a good vertical. I don't know that you've talked about it in the past. Jayshree Ullal : No, we haven't. We could do a lot better. I -- government is not big for us, but it's mixed into our enterprise momentum. It has improved year-over-year, but in terms of any kind of contribution or a large concentration we are a long way to go. Charles Yager : Next question. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hi guys. I'm trying to ask a question without asking it directly. So, the trick is looking for a big win with one of the Cloud Titans. And this question I have is, what's your outlook for Cloud Titans? Are there big wins or big announcements in the pipeline that you're looking for? Is there any -- anything you can share with us about the puts and takes, what could happen with Cloud Titans over the next few quarters? Thanks. Anshul Sadana : I thought you'd say you're very happy with the results so far, and there's more upside expected. Look, we're doing well with our customers. Segregation has been good. You know it is a competitive market, and despite that, the country will do very well with both our hardware design, our supply products, and especially our U.S. software. There's no big change. I mentioned this last as well. We're maintaining status quo in terms of customers. If the customers grew, we grow with them. We obviously don't control that aspect and can't focus on their behalf. But otherwise, it's more of moving on the next [Indiscernible] architecture with these entities. And while you think of them as Cloud Titans, internally, we think of each one as a market. There's that big and there's so much complexity. But no, there's no big announcement we're making or about to make over here. There are so many key milestones that need to be achieved before that can be done on anything that's dramatic or a big shift. Tal Liani : Can you -- if I -- if I can squeeze in another one, if not -- it's okay. Can you talk about the contribution of Cloud Titans to this quarter and also last quarter results? I'm trying to understand how important is it -- in relative terms, how important is it to the overall growth? Jayshree Ullal : So, we decided to go annually rather than quarterly, Tal. But it's staying within the annual targets we gave. I believe we said it was 34 to 39, we bracketed it. That's the contribution from Cloud Titans -- 34% to 39%. Tal Liani : What about the growth? Meaning, how much of the growth? Is it proportionately much higher than the 35% to 39% of the growth? Jayshree Ullal : No, we don't comment on -- Ita Brennan : It's pretty hard to look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The cloud and the cloud contribution to growth is our most important. Enterprise is becoming more important. But I don't think we want to try and do that on quarter by quarter. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, I think it will make more sense annually, Ita, because we're still constrained by shipments. A - Ita Brennan : : Jayshree Ullal : It would be a false signal if you said it was high, low, or medium. I think on an annual basis, it's a much better number and the growth will be good. It'll definitely be double-digits. Tal Liani : Still the number 1 vertical and no, it's important for sure. When you think of that it's not an important part of the mix. Charles Yager : Thank you, Tal. I think we are ready for the next question. Tal Liani : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel. John Marchetti : I was wondering if you could just spend a minute or two just talking about what you are seeing specifically in that 400-gig market. Obviously, we go back to the early part of the year and it seemed like we were pumping the brakes a little bit on expectations; that seem ed to change a little bit last quarter, you seemed a little bit more bullish there. Just curious if you could spend a little bit of time, and I'm assuming that it's still primarily a Cloud Titan market, but just anything you're seeing there would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Well, it\u2019s actually more than Cloud Titans. I think Arista has been trialing 200 and 400-gig since Q4 2019, if I remember, when Andy was here and we talked about the whole Portfolio products. So, this combination of 10 -- not 10 -- 100,200,400, we expect to see a significant increase. Just to give you some context here, we had about 75 customers last year and we expect that to triple to quadruple this year in customers. That's way more than the Cloud Titans. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ben Bohlen with Cleveland Research Company. Ben Bohlen : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Jayshree, you talked a little bit about getting some additional visibility from hyperscale partners versus history even into next year. With that perspective, could you talk about how you see the evolution of 200 and 400 as they roll that out, how that develops, and maybe how you think it compares with what you saw with 100 in terms of pace or speed of adoption. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Now that's a really good question. I think a 100-gig pace on adoption was remarkably fast. It was probably over an 18-month period, Anshul? Correct me if I'm wrong,2016 to '18, something like that. Right? The 200,400-gig has been more gradual. And in very many use cases it's coupled with 100-gig.  That's why it's so hard for us to separate out. And we I think are finally at this inflection point or pivot point where we expect to see more 200-gig and 400-gig shipments in our Cloud Titan customer base in the second half of this year. And I think this will continue and will be vibrant for at least 3 years to come, maybe longer. You want to -- is there a long tail to that, Anshul? You want to answer? Anshul Sadana : Well, I think it's important to note that when the world went to 100-gig in 2016,2017,100-gig was very much compatible -- backward compatible with 40-gig. It cost the same as 40-gig. It was the same power consumption as 40-gig, better than no-brainer -- Jayshree Ullal : No-brainer. Yeah. Anshul Sadana : -- upgrade. 200 and 400-gig are not the same. The Companies that are going, they\u2019re the ones absolutely needed. And there were other technologies involved like the ZR optics needed for data connections, one which were constrained last year and earlier this year as well. Which is why this adoption goes very different, and it's not at every layer of the network. And I would not model that on the 2016,2017 cycles. These are different upgrade cycles. Which is why if you ever come back to what -- to, I think, the combined 100,200,400, they\u2019re winning a lot in 100-gig using new next-gen products as well. And that is very much material and matters. Jayshree Ullal : What addition I'd like to make on the non-Cloud Titans sidemen know you're more focused on that is many times they'd make sure they buy a product that's 200,400 or even 800-gig capable, but they'll deploy only 100-gig. What's clearly happening now is customers are getting ready for the highest speeds independent on how they deploy them in timing. Ben Bohlen : That's great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : Hey, thanks very much. Ita, I believe you said in counter Q1, you grew product deferred by about 40 million or so sequentially and I thought I heard you say it's another 20 million or so this quarter. I guess the two questions I had there -- one, do you ascribe any of that to component constraints or is that all product feature sets? And then secondly, do you expect that the flow into the income statement in the second half of this year or is that stuff you'll carry with you into 2022? Ita Brennan : Yeah. It's not really related to the supply side stuff. It's more about new customers, new used cases, new products. That's what drives that number. I mean it is kind of -- even in Q2, if you look at it, some of that stuff was recognized and then we added other new stuff. So, there is kind of some churn underneath as that -- off that balance. But I don't expect us to take any revenue, net revenue if you like, out of that bucket in Q3. We'll see what happens in Q4, that\u2019s a bit further out. But I think given the comments in the script around how that balance is build, I think we've got lots of new stuff happening. I think it's probably unlikely that we would be depleting that balance this year. Jon Lopez : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex Henderson : Great, thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the environment in terms of pricing. We've heard from some players in the market that Cisco is talking about 5-10% price increases on a variety of products, including switching and routing related products, and passing through more price increases than what you alluded to. You obviously suggested that you are going to be relatively careful with that, not push through a lot of pricing on your customers.  Is there a delta developing there? And within that context, could you talk a little bit about the strategic approach of Cisco trying to bundle together the Arista -- actually the Acacia products. And whether that architectural change to a switch-routed to optical platform is something that you can concur with or which you think is a fool's errand? Jayshree Ullal : Wow, that was a loaded question. So, I'm going to break it into two. Anshul, think about the Acacia one while I discuss the delta and pricing. It's difficult for us to parse our competitors pricing. But I can tell you philosophically, we\u2019ve got backlog, we\u2019ve got products in flight and we've got customers who are making their budget plan. So, we're going to try as much as we can in the short-term to absorb the costs. That said, we will have some slight price increases, probably in the range of 5% on selective models, that will affect our customer base in the tail-end of this year and next year. And it will -- it still affects our gross margins if the mix changes dramatically to Cloud Titans as it is alluded to.  So, all this to say Alex, we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful because it's pain for us and we're going to try and mitigate the pain for customers and only apply it where there's a real shortage and a real significant cost increase. And Anshul, you want to take the Acacia question? Anshul Sadana : Yes. Alex, the way our customers buy ZR optics -- and as you know, we\u2019ve been involved in these architectures since the 2016,2017-time frame for 100-gig,100-kilometer optics. The Cloud Companies, especially launched these in the '90s and early 2000s. They do not like bundled solutions, they like to disaggregate -- to desegregate every layer, not just white boxes. And the optics and the switches are not allowed to be built in a bundled manner. They would run on separate RFP for each one. Here, we come -- they have to be independently competitive at each clear to when. Which is why this is not a concern. And as we mentioned, optically large time and other Companies can participate. We don't have to be - have our work cut out. Jayshree Ullal : And we try to qualify as many optics\u2019 vendors. So, at any given time you have a team I'm sure, that\u2019s qualifying the number of vendors; right? Anshul Sadana : But if there's a ZR optics out there, we\u2019ve qualified it. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, I've noticed. As a lead time on your qualification too, I understand. Anshul Sadana : Yes [Indiscernible] Charles Yager : Thank you, Alex. Alex Henderson : Thank you. Charles Yager : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. And Jayshree, I was going to comment before that age is just a sign of wisdom, so I wouldn't say old but just wise. And with that being said, I\u2019d like to let you and Anshul have that debate -- Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James. James Fish : I'll just let you and Anshul have that debate who is wise st, though offline. Anshul Sadana : Given that [Indiscernible] Jayshree Ullal : Good one. James Fish : So, you guys are starting to see some 5G core spending, or at least the industry is, pick up and we even saw AT&T and Microsoft announce something that the core carrier grew pretty nicely, it looks like if you use the midpoint of those ranges you gave. Does your relationship with Microsoft help extend your regions ' carrier environment as they look to take some of their core to the cloud, or will it be more of a fulfillment via support for Azure is the way to think about it? Thanks, guys. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. No, I think in the short-term, it\u2019s very much relationship-tied to Azure. But there's nothing that precludes, particularly with their investments in 5G and some of the recent acquisitions we made. It -- as you know, service providers are a long-term test of our patience. But when you win them, you win them well.  We are seeing our own personal wins independent on Microsoft very much tied to upgrade to 5G where we are the back -- the core routing and platform and spine. But specific to Microsoft, I think it will take time. It will probably emerge in the next several years. Today, it\u2019s primarily Azure. Charles Yager : Okay, we are timed for -- Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James. Charles Yager : One more ques -- Jayshree Ullal : Last but not least. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Kyle McNealy : HI, thanks a lot for the question. This is Kyle in for George Notter. Curious if there's any change in the mix of customers or ports using cloud EOS versus the traditional standard EOS bundled with a hardware sale? It may be still quite small, but any quantifiable color you can provide around what the mix might currently be and could that help your gross margin at all or make you a little less sensitive to the supply chain issues that you're seeing in some areas? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Kyle. Now cloud I -- Cloud U.S. is an example of a very strategic software platform, but it's very, very tiny in ports, and it has more to do with our multi-cloud hybrid network strategy where almost every one of these enterprise customers also had some premise strategies. So, I would say the strong influence of millions of ports is still on the mainstream platforms, and Cloud U.S. is on top of that to connect into multi-cloud. Kyle McNealy : Okay. Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Kyle. Charles Yager : This concludes the Arista Q2,2021 Earnings Call.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. A - Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us, with me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30 2021. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website.  During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the Fourth Quarter of the 2021 fiscal year. Longer-term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities. The potential impact of COVID -19 on our business, product innovation the imply of supply -- the impact of supply shortages and manufacturing constraints on our business, including lead time and inventory purchases, and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Specifically and our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.  These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. And welcome to your first earnings experience. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon for our Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. Today's call will be followed by our virtual analyst day at 3 :00 PM Pacific Standard Time. We delivered record revenues of 748.7 million for the quarter, with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.96, Acare services and software renewals contributed approximately 21.5%.  Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.9% was influenced by enterprise and Cloud Titan momentum. We remain pleased with our healthy customer growth, including record million-dollar customers and new customer logos in our mainstream enterprise. In Q3 2021, Cloud Titans was once again our top vertical with enterprise being a close second followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third and service providers at fourth place. All verticals contributed to Arista's diversity and growth. International contribution was strong at 25% with the Americas at 75% for the quarter. No Earnings Call of these days is complete without supply chain commentary. We are clearly in the midst of an acute supply chain crisis with increased prices and long lead time. We're changing our Arista mindset from our historical built to forecast in orders to build, to invest, doubling our purchase commitments in excess of 2 billion and planning for the next 1 to 2 years. Lead times of many components have extended to 50 to 80 weeks with price hikes ranging from 15% to as high as 200% across our entire supply chain of copper, steel substrate,  second board, memory, silicon, ICS, connectors, freight and labor. Arista has been deliberate and thoughtful about price increases so far as we've shared with you.  But we have recently announced increased list prices effective November 4, 2021, averaging above and approximately 10% to offset these very high escalating costs. Customer demand remains strong for Arista products as they're gaining market share in 100G, 200G, and 400G high-performance switching according to market analysts. We truly appreciate our customers and partners for their patience and understanding as we navigate these turbulent times throughout 2022 as well. Recently, we've witnessed the progress of our routing products with key customers and the acceptance of our routing edge use cases. Similar to Cloud Titans, carriers and large enterprise customers are deriving immense benefit from Arista's EOS and rich routing features. We deliver simplification and unified service delivery, with the support of segment routing, with traffic engineering, and EVPN, as well as rapid fail-over techniques.  This provides that ideal alternative to today's complex legacy router deployments with much more improved total cost of ownership and capex benefits. Since its founding of this debt has pioneered the transformation from routers to routing with these spine R series platforms. Arista third-generation, R3-series based on EOS4.26, delivers three new edge use cases this year. The first one is a multi-cloud edge that brings provisioning and programmatic traffic stearing,  The second is the Metro edge for similar protocol adoption across multiple edge VPN services into the Metro Ethernet fabric. And the final new case is a 5G ran edge. With the 5G edge is this aggregating the radio area network with scale-out routing. Continuing our theme of big bet wins, I would like to highlight worldwide examples of our strength with specific customer names in routing and campus adjacencies. The first customer was CD learn an international service provider in Italy that adopted Arista for their routing transformation. Arista solution get let them to take a fresh approach to routing for next-generation edge and backbone, reducing the complexity of protocols. This delivered LTE-U and L3 services, with EVPN or on a segment routed backbone along with modern operations and superior services and experience.  The second customer was Connecticut education network, who standardized on Arista's R series with Arista EOS being instrumental in the transformation of the VPN edge, providing 100-gig density Internet rough scale stability and manageability. The advantages and the relationship with CEN across service and engineering affirm that decision to choose us at Arista. Peering between ISVs, using a 100 gig and mPES to replace them large legacy routers.  Second customers then layer and international customer in Asia Pacific, who was delighted to partner with Arista and build a next-generation Cloud Edge and broader backbone for the infrastructure growth. Arista's rich routing spec brought programmatic traffic engineering and the core of the segment routing without sacrificing quality performance of the liability. And finally, in the campus, we continue to make progress towards our goal of doubling to 200 million in the cognitive campus in 2021.  An example of this is an international customer win in Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange, providing cognitive campus for its corporate sites in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. The new campus network is based on Arista's wired platforms, the 720 - XP series, and it's built on a multi-year relationship we've built between Arista and ASX utilizing U.S. and Cloud Vision for real-time insights across all devices in trading and non-trading environments.  In summary, Arista's customers strongly endorsed our client to cloud strategy, to SILO datasets consistently, we believe we are well-positioned for the next phase of growth in data-driven cloud networking. With proactive platforms predictive operations, and a prescriptive experience. We look forward to sharing more of this and our vision and our goals with you at our Analyst Day later this afternoon. I will pass it over now to Ita Brennan, our Chief Operating Officer for financial specifics, Ita. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $748.7 million, up 23.7% year-over-year and above the upper end of our guidance of $725 to $745 million. Shipments remained constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.5% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 22.3% in Q2. International revenues for the quarter came in at a 191 million or 25% of total revenue down from 27% in the second quarter.  This shift and geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis, reflected continued healthy performance from our Cloud Titan and in region businesses in EMEA with some volatility in our APAC business. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.9% at the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63 to 65%. We can see it's recognized from incremental supply chain costs in the period, and these were offset by a healthy mix of revenue from our enterprise customers in the quarter.  Operating expenses for the quarter were 192.4 million or 25.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at a 189.8 million. R&D spending commended a 125 million or 16.7% of revenue up from last quarter at a 119.6 million. This reflected increased headcounts and employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense were $55.8 million or 7.4% of revenue, down from $57.9 million last quarter with lower demo and other variable expenses in the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs committed $11.6 million or 1.5% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter but in line with normal quarterly seasonality. Our operating income for the quarter was $293.7 million or 39.2% of revenue. Other income expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.3 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.7%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $236.9 million or 31.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.9 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.96, up approximately 22.5% from the prior year. Now, turning to the Balance Sheet. Cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased a $134 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $357 per share.  As a recap, at the end of Q3 2021, we had repurchased $897 million or 3.9 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years, beginning in April 2019. In October 2021, a list Board of Directors increased the authorization by adding an additional $1 billion for the repurchase amount. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities, and other factors.  Now turning to the operating cash performance for the Third Quarter. We generated 200% of $273 million of cash from operations in the period reflecting strong net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 49 days up slightly from 47 in Q2, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory returns were 1.7 times consistent with last quarter, inventory increased to 575.7 million in the quarter, up from 543.2 million in the prior period.  As we continued to buffer a certain components and products. Our purchase commitments number for the quarter increased to 2.1 billion up from 1.1 billion in Q2. This reflects the combination of increased new time for many components and improved demand visibility. We continue to prioritize newer early lifecycle products for inclusion in this strategy to help mitigate the risk of obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $800 million up from $746 million in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services-related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $113 million of the balance, up from $90 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our larger Cloud  Titan customers. As a reminder, we're currently in a period of significant new product introductions combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate, and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront and parts and testing, have resulted in increased customer specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 47 days down from 54 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were 45.9 million, including approximately 40 million of CapEx related to the purchase of land, construct a new data center on hardware engineering building in Santa Clara. We will provide more details of this project, over coming quarters. Now, turning to our guidance for the Fourth Quarter and beyond. As outlined in our guidance, we now expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for the full-year 2021 of approximately 25%. This reflects continued healthy demand across all market sectors, tempered by the impact of a difficult supply environment. On the gross margin front, industry supply constraints and elevated logistics costs continue to pressure gross margins, with customer price increases as a potential offset. Based on our current outlook, we continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  Turning to spending and investments, we remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. Finally, we also announced today that Arista's Board of Directors has approved a 4 for 1 stock split. Each Arista shareholder of record at the close of business on November 11th, 2021, will receive 3 additional shares for every share held. And trading will begin on a split adjusted basis on November 18, 2021.  The goal of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the Fourth Quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows; revenues of approximately &775 million to $795 million, gross margins of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5% with diluted shares on our Pre -split basis of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz. Liz Stine : Thank you Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista Earnings Call. Due to time constraints, I would like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista Earnings Call.  We ask that you pick up your handset before asking questions in order to ensure optimal sound quality. Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong result. Really impressive. So, let me give it broad-based, Jayshree, I think you mentioned strong demand that you're seeing and I think you highlighted Cloud customers in the press release.  But just generally, if you can talk to how broad-based is the demand that you're seeing growth cloud and then what does the kind of magnitude of demand that you're seeing from enterprise customers and how do you think about sustainability of that level of demand? Would what you're seeing this year, how do we think about the screen video turn into next year? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik, for the good wishes. It's a proud moment, and I really congratulate my entire leadership team and my employees for getting us here. I think demand is very strong, as I mentioned in my audio script, across all 5 verticals, across all 3 product lines, and across all 3 sectors as well.  So, I would not -- I would tell you we are growing in that -- what Ita highlighted as our 25% annual growth -- every sector is growing. In some ways, I feel bad that I even have to rank and rate them, but if you ask me to highlight some of the growth vectors, I would say obviously Cloud Titans are back; we had a rough spell if you remember, two years ago, Halloween was not a treat, it was a trick.  And it's just come back and it is a volatile sector and its positively volatile right now. SiSo we're lver enjoying the growth of Cloud Titans, we're also enjoying many pieces of our enterprise market growing. And they really sell verticals there that are doing very, very well, not just the financials, but different parts of the enterprise. I think it's fair to say Arista has arrived in the enterprise.  We've been growing double-digits for a couple of years, and we expect to continue to see double-digit growth in the enterprise sector, and this is by far our largest momentum of all the verticals I would say. But not -- as I mentioned, a lot of routing use cases -- these routing use cases are not only in the Cloud Titans, but are obviously also in-service providers and enterprises as well. So, we're just enjoying very diversified momentum of our business at the moment. Samik Chatterjee : Congrats again. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Fahad Najam : Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask you a question on the visibility. You mentioned that certain components lead times have extended from 50 weeks to 80 weeks. I'd presume your customers in turn are giving you forward-looking guidance as well. So, can you give us a sense on the visibility you are seeing and help us quantify that in any way you can. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, I will say some few words and Ita you could add to that. I think because of these kind of long lead times on our components, first thing Ita and the team are doing, Ita and the entire team are planning ahead. And we're normally, like me said building to forecast on orders, but really building to a future demand. Visibility becomes very important in that case, because it's normal 1 or 2 quarters.  The Cloud tightness visibility has improved a lot this year. Typically, it used to be one to two quarters, right now, it's more like a year or more. This is the best visibility we've ever had with the Cloud Titans, that's allowing us to build up inventory and to build a plan and to get ahead if you will. In the enterprise as well, nobody's lead times are very good right now and we're no different.  Although we talk and we believe we have a head start by starting on this problem as early as last year, we've several -- hundreds of suppliers and we've had to increase our strategic interface with these suppliers to -- and make again, that's on them long term. Visibility in the Enterprise is also 6 months to a year. Visibility in the Cloud and specialty cloud providers is now exceeding a year. So, in general, we're now able to plan to buy components well ahead of the purchase orders and forecasts. Liz Stine : Ita, you want to add something more? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think the only thing I'd add out of this, it's hard to be too quantitative when you think about demand and bookings just because obviously the lead times and the time frames are very different. I think from -- just from a business perspective we'll continue to focus on the revenue and the revenue metrics and then the bookings numbers will kind of ebb and flow but obviously right now you are getting a lot of visibility to what's happening with customers just because we need that to be able to drive the types of purchase commitments, etc., we're driving. Fahad Najam : I appreciate the answer, thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Thanks for the question. And again, I would like to echo the positive comments. These are phenomenal results in this environment. I guess my question is regarding the cogs and that the cost of some of the products you are getting from Broadcom other companies we've talked to you during this earnings season has talked about really high expedite fees, and just wondering if you're seeing those and how they're factoring into the forward costs in the business like are you able because it has visibility to set your prices at a level that compensate for what we see higher COGS unwind, maybe the early part of next year, I'm just curious whether you've seen those expedite fees and then how they might affect margins at some point. Ita Brennan : I think everybody is seeing -- I don't want to talk about a particular supplier, but we are seeing expedite fees, and incrementing costs kind of across the supply base. And you haven't seen those in the gross margins in the Income statement today just because the mix has been more enterprise heavy, and that's been kind of offsetting this. But I think we are -- as Jayshree mentioned, we're in the process of instituting some price increases, etc., to help offset some of those costs, so that will help.  I think we're comfortable thinking about that 63% to 65% range as still being reasonable, but you will see some more volatility quarter-by-quarter just as the mix of the business. The customer mix is still going to be the biggest driver. The other cost we're managing with some of the price increases etc. when we have a heavier Cloud mix in particular corner etc., we will see some lower gross margins and what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Jayshree Ullal : And thank you for the good wishes, Rod. Rod Hall : Sure, Jayshree, no problem. Just a question -- are customer -- what about the Cloud customers? Are they willing to accept a little bit of price increase knowing that things are getting more expensive? Just curious what the conversations are like there. Jayshree Ullal : I would say all our customers are very understanding, but nobody is willingly accepting price increases, including the rich Cloud Titans. Rod Hall : Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Liz Stine : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you. Truly spectacular. And I got to just ask about the build to forecast versus build to order. When did you implement that? And what was the reaction of some of your customers or is it more internal? And what I'm wondering is how much further you may be ahead of some of your competitors. It sounds like, it's actually maybe something that you're looking for the next couple of years if you have lead times going so long. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : First of all, I just want to give a big shout out to Anshul, John McCool, Susan Hayes, and the entire manufacturing team. Let me just step back, Jim, and thank you for the kind wishes. The traditional model for everybody has been built to forecast, lead times are based on supplier commits, there's some buffers, but most of it is just-in - time. And very rarely does anybody pay for expedites. If you look at supply chain in 2022, first of all, expedites are a way of life. It doesn't matter which  it is.  You have to plan not just weeks ahead, but months ahead. Often you can get de -commits from suppliers. There\u2019re shortages across-the-board. There's lots of orders, there's no buffers. Everybody is coming at them sometimes and we used to think the high-tech industry is special, but some of the Cloud components we're talking about, we compete with the automotive industry and the consumer industry which makes it tougher.  And it isn't surprising at all to see expedites involve not just CEO has been heads of countries literally. That's how rough it. So, it's a very oversubscribed process. We thought we got a head start by starting. When was it? Either late last year when I trained the team put together a plan. So, we've definitely had heads. And if things have gotten better, we would be well ahead of everyone. But these things keep getting worse.  So now the head start is good, but we have to add to that head-start and hence the doubling of the inventory. And without naming any vendor just say, we've increased the strategic nature of our relationship with not just one or two vendors, but 25% of our vendors. This is a much larger, relationship pool and we're committing to them long-term they're committing to us, but both of us have to be patient and understanding of the short-term troubles we have. Jim Suva : Thank you, and again, really big congratulations to you and your entire entity. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Say kudos to my team. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul Silverstein : Thanks for taking the questions. Two  questions if I may. Were there any 200 gigs from Facebook in any 400-gig revenue from Microsoft in your third quarter and do you expect in the fourth quarter? And Jayshree, would you care to comment on their outlook for next year? I know with supply chain it's challenging. Jayshree Ullal : I'm just checking to see, but there was 400-gig revenue overall. As I told you last time, we have increased our customer logos in the 400-gig category from 75 customers. last year to over the first half was 150 and trending to about 300 customers, so the definitely 400 gigs. I need to double check on whether there were any 200 gigs. Let me beg off the question. Ita Brennan : I'm just going to say, Paul, some of the commentary on the deferred is probably relevant here too, where we talked about the deferred balance becoming more Cloud Titan heavy this quarter, whereas before it has been more other verticals, etc., I think that's -- we maybe not have had revenue but we've, probably had activity Jayshree Ullal : Just trying to revenue, so we have some work to Paul Silverstein : Just specific to issue the question specifically. since booking Microsoft, I assume a lot of that revenue is being deferred or maybe it's not, that's the best specific question. Ita Brennan : I think we grew our deferred revenue when me mixed stepping towards Cloud and that includes new products. Jayshree Ullal : So, 200-gig and 400-gig. Paul Silverstein : Would  give any comment about Jayshree Ullal : We are going to at the Analyst Day how by then? Paul Silverstein : I can wait 30 minutes. Jayshree Ullal : All right.  I apologize for keeping you up late, but will make it shorter, I think our analyst day will be two hours? Paul Silverstein : Yes. Ita Brennan : So, you won't have to stay up too long. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Thank you for the question. Jayshree, you've mentioned a couple of times talking about reference to Enterprise wins and that really kind of dialing up as far as momentum. But if you were to bullet point the key reasons why you're winning -- you continue to win with what sounds like increasing momentum; can you just highlight them for us because most of the people on this call are used to hearing about very dependable sales channels and many other vendors with very comprehensive solutions. Can you walk us through the key sales pitch and just what is resonating with the Enterprise customers? Jayshree Ullal : And again, I'll do some at it, but the analyst day, but. First of all, I think our relevance in the enterprise customer has increased from data center, Goodyear, much broader portfolio that's client to cloud going all the way from campus Wi - Fi.  designs for the data center to routing and a very large  software well, everything from ACare to Cloud Vision, to Cloud US  software, as well as our acquisition of Big Switch and Awake now contributing as well to segmentation, observability, and security as well.  So, the completeness and the innovative nature of our close portfolio has helped. The second thing that's helped is our Power of One, if you will. One OS, one image, one Cloud Vision. Customers just love that, not just the innovation, but the quality and support of not having device silo boxes, but having an innovative and much better operate experience with a much lower TCO.  And finally, at the enterprise customers, these got -- we have now -- much as we talked about products, we have invested in customers. Our investment and sales led by Krishna and Ashwin Kohli and the entire team worldwide really began in 2017. This is our third or fourth year of enterprise investment, and I think we're not seeing the results of that. The first and second year and we were kind of getting in and we're just coming into the campus. And now I think we're coming onto our own in a complete holistic fashion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Jason Ader : Thanks for the question. First, I want to say horrible numbers; you guys need to do better. But my question is can you quantify the backlog or book-to-bill or anything that might help us understand how much of a gap there is between demand and supply, and is there any risk that customers are over ordering right now where you could see an air gap in demand, maybe in some time in 2022? Ita Brennan : Yeah, Jason, I know lots of folks have been talking about bookings and trying to put some boundaries around that. I just think it's really hard from a timing perspective. When you have these lead times, of course, you're going to have accelerated bookings and larger bookings. And certainly, we have our fair share of that. There's no -- it sounds difficult to talk about the business I think in that context, so we're more focused on what can we deploy and we're seeing - and that's how we're running it internally as well. What are the periods where these bookings will get deployed and building our deployment plans?  And that's really what's going to matter. I think when you think about the business that way, the pull-ins and push-outs of the actual booking\u2019s numbers and how much visibility you are getting, etc., becomes less important. Not ducking your question, we have obviously lots of demand. We've talked about the demand that we have, but these are extended lead times, so we're just focused on making sure we understand how it's going to get deployed. Jayshree Ullal : And I want to echo what Ita just said. We're not going to get excited about backlog. We're going to get excited about deploying our customers with real revenue. And some of the backlog may materialize and remember, they're cancelable orders; some of them may not.  It's best to be responsible as a Company, as we always have been, and share with you that demand is certainly outstripping supply, no question about that and we're going to work hard as hell on fulfilling the supply and improving the supply. Liz Stine : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Thanks. I realized it's difficult to quantify the supply chain impact currently, but if any way to help us with the gross margin impact and should we see the gross margin step-down in the guide as more supply chain related or more related to the mix of revenue types? Thanks. Ita Brennan : I think the best way to think about it is that we've been operating at the upper end of that range for the last couple of quarters. That's definitely a customer mix effect. It's offsetting some of the cost impacts as well, and we've been deferring some of the, as Paul was talking about, some of the larger customer revenue as well.  So, I think I should look forward, kind of outside of these quarters when the mix of the business comes back to something more balanced, I think you will see us back towards the bottom end of that range from time-to-time. I think we believe we'll stay in the range over a long period of time, but there will be quarters where we could be pressuring the bottom end of that range and maybe even break the boss.  I mean, the net range, while for vague and for four quarters, I think we can still be okay. So, there is definitely a customer element of this. There's a cost increase element to this, and we will benefit from some customer price increases here that will help offset some of that, but I think the days of living at the upper end of that range, I wouldn't assume that we can do that on an ongoing basis as you look forward. Meta Marshall : Got it. And not the Traveo, but like spending forward guidance, but just further price increases. I would say probably won't see most of that impact to Q4, you would expect the price increases impacts from Q1 in 2022. Ita Brennan : Yes. Meta Marshall : Thank you. Congrats. Ita Brennan : Thanks Meta Meta Marshall : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Meta Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. This is a question for both, I guess Jayshree and Ita. I just want to follow up on the Cloud Titan capex and Hyperscale capex and the visibility. I think it's fairly well documented that the balance of this year into 2022, there's going to be significant data center expansion and availability expansion by the hyperscale\u2019s, so that's clearly reflected in your confidence. But you noted that you have a little bit more than a year visibility.  How should we think about 2023? I know we don't even have '22 guidance yet, but given the strength in the expansion in the availability, and the data center trajectory, how do we think about that? And then just as a follow-up on pricing, when you think about the 10% price hike that you're going to implement in a couple of weeks, in your mind, does that sort of more than offsets the supply chain or is it -- is there a way to quantify how we're thinking about price versus the margin impact from the higher components? Does it cut -- does it reduce it by 50%? Is there some way to think about it that we can model out going forward? Thank you. Ita Brennan : We've tried to be very transparent with customers in terms of what we're seeing on the cost side and looking for them to help us kind of offset that. So, we're definitely not looking to increase margin or make margin on that, we've been we've been very open and transparent in what we're seeing on the cost side and looking for help to offset that. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, and to ask your question on 2023, I guess I would say stay tuned for the analyst day, we'll try and give you a better visibility on 2022 and give you a sum of visionary statements on 2023 and beyond. David Vogt : Great thank you guys. Ita Brennan : Thanks David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. And Alex on (ph.) my congratulations as well to you. I guess, when I look at your performance in 2021 based on the midpoint of the guide for December, I think you would have clearly gained some sizable market share in the year. I'd love to understand; do you think these share gains are coming from Whitebox vendors or coming more from the traditional competition that you have? And then maybe a second part of this, as you think about the next couple of years up, could you see customers that use Whitebox solutions today come to Arista and if so, what do you think would motivate them to do so? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Both very good questions and related to each other. I would say, this year with all the supply chain issues, much more of our share gains is coming from Enterprise and Cloud Titans. Just getting our fair share from our peers in the industry, not necessarily white-box. If you fast -forward to later years, I do think Arista will have an advantage, not just in product capability, but also in the ability to rapidly supply product probably better than some of the white boxes and Anshul has often alluded to this.  So, the make versus buy decision for many of our Cloud Titan s may shift in the direction of Arista rather than strictly white boxes. We look forward to that. I'm not going to make any guesses on that, but I don't preclude that and neither has Anshul when he's spoken in the past so it certainly wasn't part of the market share gains and the growth this year, but it could be next year. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks for taking my question. I'm very intrigued by the one-year visibility you have with your Cloud clients. And on that front, I was wondering first  impact we planned  CapEx on next year by 60, 65% or so last week. And I was wondering, is that something that is I would say aligned with the visibility you have or if you came as a set price.  And then along the same line within that visibility, how do you see the spending of Cloud Titans changing, in terms of, how it's displayed between what's happening inside the data center which is more on the switching side, and what is more happening outside today that's been there in the DCI and more on the routing side. Thanks, a lot. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Pierra. Both again very good questions I'll take the second one first, I think Arista 's presence for most part until recently has been intro data center. But what has been phenomenon to watch my Cloud Titan team do lead by Anshul, Martin, and others, is they use cases, have proliferated, not only outside the data center of a DCI, but routing AI use-cases top of rack use-cases, special customized use cases.  So, both within the datacenter and outside Arista is getting its fair share of opportunity to respond. And then we're doing a lot of proof-of-concepts and testing work with them. Regarding the plot Titan capex spend, we're always surprising on the numbers actually come out of because they are in billions and, of course, they're nowhere close to the percentage they spend with us necessarily. But our relationship with Facebook takes back now at useful five-years, we have done joint development with them in the FBOSS and we've jointly developed products with them. We have shared with you in the past that we're developing our next-generation of product with them, the 200 gigs. We were pleasantly surprised, but we were not completely surprised. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks, Jayshree. That's great. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question and congratulations as well for me. I think the one number that stands out the most to me is your 2.1 billion plus purchase commitment. And I think that's up over 4X relative to what it was exiting last year. I think going into kind of the June quarter, the expectations, whereas that maybe some of these component constraints would start to ease as we move into the mid part of 2022 and certainly into the second half, and just curious, your best assessment right, now, where you stand on some of those lead times, starting to normalize or shortened back down. And do I think that you're going to carry kind of this higher degree of visibility well into 2023 at this point. Thank you. Liz Stine : And presenter, are -- is your line muted? Ita Brennan : Sorry about that. I don't know when that -- when that happened. Where did I stop? Yes. I think what the  Sorry, Aaron, can you help me with how much of that you got? Aaron Rakers : I -- actually I didn't hear any of it. I apologize. Ita Brennan : Let me start. We probably have two dynamics happening. We've seen a push-out of lead times again with the products and the vendor that we were managing directly. That's probably -- I think now our view is that's probably the end of 2022 before we start to see things get better there. In addition to that, we've also seen it kind of broaden out to other components.  And we're now managing vendors directly that would have normally gone through the supply chain, gone through the contract manufacturers, etc., and we're having to engage directly with those suppliers and then that's also driving some increase in those purchase commitments, and we're looking out longer with those suppliers as well.  And so, the combination I think of both of those is making that number increase. We are trying to focus on new products and products that have long life cycles. So that gives us a little bit more leeway there in terms of taking longer -- a longer view. And we'll continue to do that. But I don't think we've  the point yet where things are improving. Jayshree Ullal : Aaron, we see this as an important investment to the business. It is a decision that Ita, myself and Anshul, have made very consciously we've got to invest in the business, and we've got to invest in getting product to our customers, we think this is an important part of our decision-making process because of the prolonged situation here with supply chains. Aaron Rakers : Very helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hey, ladies. Congrats, great quarter. I guess a couple of questions for me. First of all, with regards to the purchase commitments. Can you give us a little bit more color whether this is a response to competitors of yours doing the same with your suppliers? And does this lock in volume or does it also lock in price for the components that you are buying? Ita Brennan : Yeah. No, I think it's totally off working on our own strategy, and as Jayshree mentioned earlier, we've started to do that right back at the beginning of last year even. So just a continuation of that. I think the biggest driver is obviously what's happening in the supply chain and understanding what's happening in the supply chain and just the breadth of suppliers that we need to kind of manage directly and start to deal with directly right now.  And I think that's the biggest driver of the up the change as opposed to anything that anybody else doing, etc. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question, Ittai? Ittai Kidron : Does it lock in just the volume or does it also lock into prices for you going forward? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, when you make long-term commitments, there is kind of a pricing element to that, but that you have that price base as things start to get better, we'll see how some of that plays out, but they are obviously isn't pricing in the market today in that pricing is kind of what you're making these commitments Athens. But as time, as we've seen over time in the past, when things start to loosen up in some of that can change as lot, but right now it is the commitment to volume and price. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. As you probably remember early in my career, I was told never to high-five managements on a public call. I'll leave it at that. I wanted to see if maybe you could expand a little bit on the CapEx opportunity, which sounds like it's overshadowed by what's going on in datacenter, but just want to get a better sense of where you stand in that part of your business in the trajectory. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. We will take your virtual high five. I think the campus business has been very relevant to a seat of the table with Enterprise customers. We're now starting to see Enterprise wins and logos where we win the campus before we win a data center because many of these Enterprises don't have large datacenters.  I think the conversations, the strategy, the ability to bring all of the silo datasets together, whether it's in your campus or data center, on the core  is very important and customers are looking to us to build there and modernize their enterprise network. So, from that standpoint, although the numbers are still small and we're talking about doubling from a 100 to 200, we think it will be extremely relevant strategically with our enterprise for our customers and will grow obviously, in the next few years. There's also a component of channels river still pretty nascent. And most of our success and engagement to-date is direct, albeit fulfilled by channels. But we hope that will change over time and that will add further strength to our campus. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hi guys. I have two questions. One is just if you can give us an update on campus switching, where you are versus your targets, if you said it, I apologize, I just didn't hear it. And second, I just want to understand about the accounting. Can you go over again the price increases? When are they kicking in, if they kicked it already, and then what happens with your cost of goods sold since it's on  I\u2019m assuming it's on  like everyone else? Does it mean that right now you're still recording cheaper components, so the margins are higher? I'm just trying -- or maybe I'm totally wrong. I just want to understand the margin evolution as component pricing goes up and pricing increases kick-in. Ita Brennan : Yeah. Jayshree Ullal : Go ahead. Ita Brennan : It's some combination of all of those, Tal. There are some expedite costs that doesn't end up being period expenses that we've been recognizing. We recognized a chunk last quarter; we had some again in Q3. There are other costs like higher pricing increases at such as that will end up being inventoried and will flow with the inventory, and some of that obviously will burn through the inventory that we have in the supply chain and then we'll start to see those costs.  Those will line up better, hopefully, with some of the price increases that we are passing onto customers as well. It's going to be complex; it won't necessarily be perfect. But as we look at the various different scenarios, there's a better chance of those lining up with the price increases. So that will help offset some of that. Jayshree Ullal : And finally, Tal, on the campus, we committed to double the $100 million achievement we had last year -- this year. And here we are sitting 2 months away from the end of the year. So, we believe we will  and we will have to set a new goal for next year. Tal Liani : Got it. And just going back to the margin, so I know you're probably going to discuss it tonight, but just in general, how do we think about gross margin going forward? Ita Brennan : It's definitely part of the discussion later. Jayshree Ullal : Right. I think you already mentioned -- you -- that was mentioned already, we continue to believe with the price increase effective November 4th which will really be effective next year by the time customers realize it and see it, that we will be able to offset the escalating cost and our gross margin was depend on mix. And as Ita often said, if we are heavily mixed on the Cloud Titans, we could be on the low-end of the 63 to 65 and pressured on gross margin there. If we're having a mixed on the enterprise, we could be on the mid-to-high-end, like we have been. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Tal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bohlen with Cleveland Research. Ben Bohlen : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you view the current technology build-out -- the new technology build-out for both enterprise and Cloud as they start to transition into 200 and 400, how you see similar or different versus what you saw from 2016 to 2018 with more Cloud Titan spilling out 100, any thoughts on duration, behavior, any puts and takes would be interesting. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Sure Ben. I think the Cloud Titan behavior will be different than the Enterprise behavior. On the Cloud Titan, you're going to see a much more rapid inflection to 200 gig and 400 gigs, especially in the spine layers and the uplinks at the top of rack. And they've always been an early and faster adopter of speeds in technology, especially within the data center or even datacenter to datacenter.  We are expecting an inflection of 200 gig and 400 gigs. That's -- basically at the start of this year was very challenged with ecosystem and availability of optics and even switches the last year. The year of inflection in my view, is really late this year late this year goes well into 2022 on the enterprise still we expect to have, by the end of this year, 300 customers, 200 and 400 gigs. Primarily 400 gigs, I would say.  And as you know, our customer base is more than 7000, so obviously 100 gig and 400 gigs will continue to co-exist and live happily ever after together. But we will start to see the uptake and adoption of 400-gig in the end -- in the high-end, and early adopters of enterprise as well, like we're starting to see this year. I think the next few years can be best characterized as inflection of new, higher speeds, like two hundred and four hundred and the continuation and adoption of 100 gig in the mainstream enterprise. Ben Bohlen : Thanks, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with GMP Securities. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Congrats and curious, how is the constraints affected the 400-gig market? It sounds like you've been doing well there, but has that been a factor? And does that make a difference from a market share perspective? Do you have any advantage or disadvantage in terms of access for your 400 gig components? Jayshree Ullal : Eric, I'd say we're as constrained on 400-gig components as we are 100-gig components, it's been a factor for all speeds. We're just constrained what can I tell you. But our market share continues to be strong in both. We're doing well in both. I'll flagship platform, the 7800 because especially 400 gig dependents are one of the most popular products.  At the same during my  and 100 gig versions of 7500 and 7800 are very popular too. So, supply-chain, is different for everything. It's not necessarily thinking one speed over the other. Erik Suppiger : Are the optics anything different? Jayshree Ullal : The optics is actually better than last year in terms of the ecosystem for 400-gig coming up, not different other than that, it's actually improved for 400 gigs. Erik Suppiger : Okay, very good, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to go back to a statement earlier, I'm paraphrasing but I think you said you were running the business to demand rather than orders or something to that effect. Could you go back and expand upon that, I'm just curious about what you meant on that, I assume you are trying to look through customer order books and try to see what they really need as opposed to excess ordering, maybe you could just expand on that. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : It's actually the other way around, George, what we said is all the just-in-time and built to forecast and being extremely disciplined about buying inventory only when the customer puts and in order has gone out the window a little bit. And because of these long lead times, we're having to plan to order well, ahead of the customer orders of forecast, that's what we meant.  It's built to purchase orders to our supply chain, rather than built a customer purchase order. Does that make sense? Since there's still constrained on long lead times. So, we're making a bet that the supply chain constraints, which I hope will eventually improve, will favor those of us who make those kinds of purchase commitment. And so, we're having to get in there early and fast, even before the customer orders come in. George Notter : Out of curiosity, do you have any flexibility on those purchase commits? Are they cancelable on your side? Jayshree Ullal : Most of the Semiconductor components are non - cancelable, but that's just the way the business is run. We've been careful to choose components that we don't need to cancel, like picking new products and taking common componentry across them. We believe there's limited risk in the investment we've made. George Notter : Super. Okay. Thanks very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, George. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : Thanks so much for squeezing me in and I apologize because I understand the same topic. But hopefully will be the last one we can cover the rest of the stuff on the Analyst Day. This has been alluded to a few times. If we look at your largest competitor, they've also, roughly doubled their purchase commitments fairly recently, you're now doing the same. The dollars collectively are like many multiples larger than either of you have ever carried.  I guess my question here is, to what extent do you think inventories actually evolving into a competitive weapon as we think about 2022 and 2023, and maybe like to what extent as in introduce risk, like if you can't get supply as fast or in the same quantities that you're envisioning now, can that influence your revenue outlook in 2022 or in 23? Jayshree Ullal : I think there's no doubt that supply is shaping our revenue line right now. Almost more so than demand, right? I think that, that is a factor we are constrained.  So, supply is definitely a factor, I think in terms of looking at the purchase commitments, we are working very carefully with the suppliers and again, we're expanding kind of the breadth of what we're doing. And we are expanding the lead times on the length of time that recovering with those purchase commitments. And I think that's important.  Then again, we're doing it on new products -- newer products that have significant lives ahead of them. So really, the risk we're taking somewhat is tying up some cash etc., it's not because of the lifecycle of the products and stuff. It's not really an obsolescence risk, but it could take some time to burn through that inventory if things change but I think it's a bet that's worth making.  We're making it obviously in consultation and discussion with customers, etc. But it is a longer lead time and then a broader set of suppliers than we'd normally carry. That's why you're seeing that big uptick. We're not only doing it for the components that we used to offer in the past directly, but we're also now doing it for components that would have come to us through the CMs in a normal supply environment. Jon Lopez : Understood. Okay, thanks for the thoughts. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, thank you very much. Liz Stine : This concludes the Arista Q3 2021 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website. Thank you for joining us today.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the Arista website following this call. Mr. Venk Nathamuni, Arista\u2019s Head of Corporate and Finance and Investor Relations, you may begin. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results of its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 30, 2021. If you would like a copy of the press release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the longer-term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19, supply chain constraints, manufacturing capacity and inventory purchases on our business, product innovation, and finally, the benefits of acquisitions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our SEC filings, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and should not be relied on as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, let me now turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ven. And welcome to your first earnings call at Arista. We\u2019re excited to have you on board as our Executive Head of Corporate Development, IR and Finance. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. If there\u2019s one thing that pandemic has taught us, it is that it comes with variant surprises. With vaccines and booster choices, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe during the latest spread of the Omicron variant. I am proud of our employees for adapting and thank our partners and customers for placing their trust in us during these ever-changing times. Back to Q4 2021. We delivered revenues of $824.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.82. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 21% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 64.3% was influenced by increasing supply chain costs. We registered a record number of million-dollar customers as a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise and campus section that we have experienced throughout the year. We have now surpassed in excess of 8,000 cumulative customers. In terms of Q4 2021 verticals, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical, followed by the enterprise, followed by the specialty cloud providers at third place, financials at fourth place and service providers at fifth place. All the verticals grew well at double-digit percentages in 2021. In terms of Q4 geographical mix, international contributions was strong at 29%, with the Americas at 71% for the quarter. Shifting to annual sector revenue for the year in 2021. Cloud Titans registered approximately 30% of the revenue, enterprise and financials came in at approximately 40%, and the providers at approximately 30%. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer at a 15% contribution. We do expect Meta, formerly Facebook, to become our second 10% revenue customer in 2022, as we improve lead time. I would now like to invite Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer, to shed more light on our Cloud Titan execution. Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. Our cloud business continues to be strong. In 2021, we successfully transitioned from prototype to trials to production on our latest products for 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig. The Arista 7800 is now deployed at scale for data center spine, PCI and regional spines and AI spine clusters. The Arista 7388, which we co-developed with Meta and announced at OCP, November last year, is also now running successfully in production data centers. We not only continue to do well in existing use cases, but are also winning in new areas like WAN and Cloud Edge. Feedback from our largest customers is consistent. Arista products are easier to work with and have far fewer issues than competition. While there is often speculation about share shifts in some of our use cases, demand for our products from these Cloud Titans remains healthy. To quote one of our largest customers directly, \u201cArista continues to maintain and even grow its leadership position in these high-volume leaf spine deployments.\u201d Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. We look forward to our continued partnership with the Cloud Titans, something you and the entire engineering team has been nurturing for over a decade. In terms of annual 2021 product lines, our core cloud and data center products, built upon our highly differentiated Arista EOS stack, is successfully deployed across 10, 25, 40, 100, 200 and 400-gig speeds. This drove approximately 64% of our revenue with strong cloud and enterprise spending cycles. We believe we will continue to be the number 1 in market share for both 100-gig and 400-gig ports according to industry analysts. Our second market is network adjacencies comprised of routing, replacing routers and the cognitive campus workspaces. We doubled our campus revenue at approximately $200 million in 2021 and aiming to double again to $400 million in 2022. Our investments in the cognitive campus switching spines and wireless generated significant customer wins versus incumbents. We successfully deployed in many routing edge and peering use cases winning Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 service provider projects for routing. Our investments in the simplification of the routing stack and the edge is yielding traction. Just in 2021 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 37 platforms. We delivered over 1,500 features in routing over the past two years. The total campus and routing adjacencies together contributed approximately 14% of revenue as a compelling alternative to legacy networks. Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, DANZ Monitoring Fabric, or DMF observability, and the advanced Network Detection and Response, NDR, with AVA sensors or security. Arista\u2019s subscription-based network services and software contributed approximately 22% of total product revenue. We are proud that CloudVision has now exceeded over 1,300 cumulative customers as a highly differentiated integral element for our customers\u2019 network agility and operations. To recap our discussion at November 2021 Analyst Day, the networking industry is right for this digital transformation to data-driven networking. Arista is well positioned as a leader in this client to cloud networking. A key part of the strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of the data network. Software functions such as routing, security and observability are inherently embedded into the Arista EOS. Our EOS has evolved to a third-generation software stack with both, state and store-driven NetDL functions. NetDL, our Network Data Lake architecture that we launched in November 2021, is resonating well with customers. We are building upon our cloud network heritage to bring proactive platform, predictive operations and a prescriptive experience to unify data sets from multiple sources. We are consistently harnessing the powerful combination of NetDL and AVA, or Autonomous Virtual Assist to gather, store and process multiple modalities of network generated data and network-related data. AVA uses a supervised AI/ML algorithm and natural language processing to help network operators with root cause analysis and threat hunting. Looking ahead into 2022, as I engage with worldwide customers, I\u2019m observing fatigue and frustration with our peers\u2019 discontinuity in products and low support and quality. In contrast, Arista\u2019s pursuit of world-class data-driven networking is unwavering. It cannot be achieved by us alone. We joined forces with industry leaders to collaborate with Microsoft, VMware, Red Hat, Equinix, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk, Zscaler and Zoom to name a few, that together build our collaborative ecosystem. In summary, I\u2019m so proud of our team\u2019s execution across multiple dimensions in 2021. With a record-setting year at $2.94 billion, 27% annual growth and a cash flow for the first time exceeding $1 billion, this was indeed an exciting and memorable year for Arista. It marked a time of the Cloud Titans growth, coupled with diversified momentum across our product lines and customer sectors. Arista\u2019s profile and affinity with customers has heightened to earn a strategic seat at the table. And so, despite the supply chain obstacles that we now expect to continue into 2023, we have emerged stronger. We reiterate our 30% annual growth outlook mentioned at November\u2019s Analyst Day as we now aim for $3.85 billion in 2022 and multiple years of growth ahead. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ita, our CFO, for financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 and full year 2021 results and our guidance for Q1 2022 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. In addition, all share-related numbers are provided on a post split basis to reflect the 4-for-1 stock split completed in November 2021. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $824.5 million, up 27.1% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $775 million to $795 million. We continue to see strong demand across all our market sectors with particular strength from our Cloud Titan customers as we ramp our new products. Shipments remained constrained in the quarter as we continued to carefully navigate industry-wide supply shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with Q3. International revenues for the quarter came in at $242.1 million or 29% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. This completes a year of strong international performance with international revenues for the year growing 46% on a year-over-year basis. This reflects healthy performance with our in-region customers, combined with solid contributions from our larger Cloud Titan customers. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 64.3%, just above the midpoint of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. We continue to recognize incremental supply chain costs in the period and began to see an increase in Cloud Titan revenue mix in the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were $206.2 million or 25% of revenue, up from last quarter at $192.4 million. R&D spending came in at $130.3 million or 15.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at $125 million. This primarily reflected increased headcount and employee-related costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $61.2 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $55.8 million last quarter, with increased headcount and higher variable compensation expenses. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $14.7 million or 1.8% of revenue. Our operating income for the quarter was $324.2 million or 39.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.5 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.4%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $262.4 million or 31.8% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 319.75 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $0.82, up approximately 32.3% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased $176 million of our common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $113 per share. As a recap, this completes the April 2019 $1 billion repurchase authorization, having repurchased a total of 16.7 million shares at approximately $60 per share. In addition, we initiated repurchases against the October 2021 $1 billion Board authorization, purchasing $72.9 million or 590,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $124 per share. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. Now, turning to operating cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $225 million of cash from operations in the period, completing our first year with cash generation in excess of $1 billion. This reflects the strong earnings and cash flow potential of our business model even in a period of increasing investments, inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 58 days, up from 49 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings and deferred revenue growth in the period. Inventory turns were consistent with last quarter at 1.7 times. Inventory increased to $650.1 million in the quarter, up from $575.7 million in the prior period, reflecting increased component buffers and some added inventory costs. Our purchase commitments for the quarter were $2.8 billion, up from $2.1 billion in Q3. This is in response to increased lead times now extending into 2023 and continued strength in demand. As a reminder, we continue to prioritize newer early life cycle products for inclusion in these strategies in order to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $929 million, up from $800 million in Q3. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $160 million of the balance, up from $113 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our larger Cloud Titan customers. As a reminder, we remain in a period of significant new product introductions, combined with healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront in-person testing, have resulted in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 63 days, up from 47 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.5 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. As outlined at our Analyst Day, we expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for 2022 of approximately 30%. This reflects continued healthy demand across all our market sectors, tempered by the impact of a difficult supply environment. On the gross margin front, we see continued industry-wide supply constraints and elevated logistics costs, with some offset from customer price increases. While we expect gross margins for the first quarter to be in the range of 63% to 64%, we would highlight the potential negative impact of customer mix in future quarters. If we are successful in improving supply, enabling our Cloud Titan contribution to accelerate, it would likely result in gross margins below the typical guidance range. Now turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows : revenues of approximately $840 million to $860 million; gross margin of 63% to 64%; and operating margin at approximately 38%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21%, with diluted shares on a post-split basis of approximately 320 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Venk. Venk? Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Ita. We\u2019re now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I\u2019d like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, please take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : So, my one question would be regarding the enterprise momentum, given the disclosure on the split, enterprise growth in \u201821 is over 40%. And I wonder if you could dig a little bit into the verticals where you\u2019re succeeding there and talk a little bit about sustainability of that momentum, and it\u2019s extremely strong momentum? And by the way, congratulations over $1 billion of revenue there -- well over $1 billion. So just wondering if you can give more color on what\u2019s going on in enterprise, how that looks for \u201822? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Rod. So yes, the contribution has definitely been a pleasure to watch. And the traction by the enterprise also includes the financials. So, we\u2019ve had some very good traction with financials, which has been a long-time customer for us, but we very much landed and expanded in the financials. So, that would be a moment of pride for us. But we are going across many cylinders on the enterprise. We\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the health care, in the media and entertainment, across international geographies. And of course, the campus traction is also included in the enterprise. So, a lot of diversity in our enterprise momentum, and it\u2019s one we\u2019re proud of and expect to have continuing this year as well. Rod Hall : And Jayshree, could you just maybe give us anything on campus, like how is that going? I know there\u2019s been a lot of demand generally for campus Wi-Fi, but I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re feeling there at the moment. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So, I think in general, as we have shared with you, we are doing extremely well with our own Arista U.S. customer base who is very familiar with us. And therefore, we are seeing a lot of million-dollar customers just embracing Arista EOS in the campus. So, that would be a point of real success. The second thing I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re not just seeing Wi-Fi, but we\u2019re really seeing the unification of wired and wireless across the edge, and that\u2019s been a very interesting momentum as well in the campus. So, a lot more work ahead of us. As you\u2019ll all often point out, these numbers are still small, but we\u2019re looking to make them larger. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : Congrats on the results as well. Jayshree, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about improving lead times with, I think, Meta, in particular, but maybe if you can just dig into that a bit more how\u2019s visibility today in terms of improving lead times as we go through the year? Where do you see the supply chain standing today? Is it better or worse than maybe a quarter ago? And any sort of details on where you\u2019re seeing the more shortages? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik. Well, first of all, I want to say thank you, customers for giving us more visibility on your forecast. That has helped a lot. And usually, with our Cloud Titans, we only got one or two quarters. No, we\u2019re literally getting a year which helps. It helps us plan. It helps us project. It helps us do a whole lot of things, and Anshul and the team have done a phenomenal job there. That being said, I do want to say that supply chain, we felt improved in November when we met with you all at the Analyst Day, but declined in January, when we started seeing some decommits from some of our component vendors. So, I would describe our supply chain shortages as two steps forward and one step backward. We don\u2019t like the one step backward, but between the Omicron virus, the labor shortages, the logistics and the component shortages, we\u2019re certainly experiencing another wave of uncertainty in Q1 over here. So, we do have elevated lead times. So, some of our components, as I\u2019ve shared with you, they are anywhere from 50 to 70 weeks. It\u2019s no fun. But therefore, I think our commitment for the year will be back-end loaded. We\u2019ll keep improving every quarter, but Q1 isn\u2019t the great indicator of supply chain improving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Jason Ader : Yes. Thanks. And thanks for the disclosure on the breakdown of campus and routing and the software. I guess, my question is, what was the growth in 2021 for those two particular product segments, campus and routing, which was 14% of revenue? I think you said in the software, which was 22%. What was the year-over-year growth rates for those two? Jayshree Ullal : Oh Gosh. Maybe Ita, you can help me. I know the campus is excellent. It was double, right? I don\u2019t have the numbers for me on software and routing off-hand. Maybe would... Ita Brennan : The software piece was probably growing pretty much in line with the business, right, because the percentage of revenue is pretty constant. The routing piece itself, I don\u2019t have that at hand. Jason Ader : Okay. All right. So, yes, if you can locate the kind of campus and routing for 2020 at some point, that would be helpful. I can follow up offline, but... Ita Brennan : Yes. Jayshree Ullal : That has doubled. So, we know that 100%. Jason Ader : Right. But routing, I was curious about -- you combine those two, right, as 14%? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. As a contributor, we did. Yes. We\u2019ll get back to you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if maybe you could discuss a little bit of the moving parts in your cost of goods sold? And what I\u2019m thinking about specifically is whether your component suppliers, particularly semiconductors, have retroactively raised prices on you, or if we\u2019re going to see higher input costs maybe six months from now as goods you\u2019ve ordered last year start coming in at higher prices? Could you could help us unpack how to think about those drivers? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve definitely seen increases in prices, and we\u2019ve talked about that, right? We had some orders that were repriced. So there has been some repricing of backlog, right? Given the extended lead times, that\u2019s just the reality is people try to fulfill against that open backlog to those suppliers, we\u2019re seeing that they need to make increases there. So, we\u2019ve definitely seen some of that. So I think, it\u2019s a combination of both. You\u2019re seeing ongoing kind of disruptions and increases as you go forward, but also some repricing of our backlogs to these suppliers, right? Do we know kind of where this is going to go next? I think we\u2019re watching that very carefully to see if there are further increases. We\u2019ve obviously passed on some of those increases to our customers with the price increases that we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve been transparent about what we\u2019re seeing on the cost side. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ll continue to monitor with suppliers and with customers and take what actions we need to take as we go forward. Simon Leopold : But just to be more specific, do you expect gross margin would be weaker in the second half of your calendar year or similar to the first half? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, I think what -- I\u2019ll go back to kind of our normal commentary around gross margin. I think what we\u2019ve said is as we fulfill backlog that was kind of at older pricing, we\u2019ll see some pressure there. Then, we\u2019ll start to benefit from some customer price increases that we put into place, but that\u2019s not going to happen for some time because we had quite a large backlog and long lead times. At the same time, we will see some mix shifts between the different pieces of the business. So, I think we can maintain some similar gross margins across the various pieces of the business. But then as the customer mix shifts, that will have a bigger impact. That\u2019s why we would caution as we\u2019re able to improve supply and grow that Cloud Titan piece of the business, again, it will have a negative impacting in gross margin in outer quarters potentially, right? So, I think it\u2019s a like-for-like kind of sector-to-sector. I think we can do a good job of kind of managing that. But then, as we mix between the different pieces, again, that\u2019s going to have an impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I was hoping you could just talk about the recent 7800R3 offering. I think that\u2019s what it was called, the AI spine offering. It was sort of around the same time that Facebook launched the super AI cluster, but I\u2019d love to understand what is the solution all about? Are you just -- is this just a next-gen product so you already have in place, or is this for new workloads, new applications that\u2019s potentially expanding your TAM? And if is, what are the workloads and how much would your TAM expand by with these offerings? Jayshree Ullal : Always a good question, Amit. Thank you. I\u2019ll kick it off and then Anshul will go into more detail. So first of all, we have been very strong in the cloud network, which we largely call a front-end network, the leaf-spine architecture, and we\u2019ve been pioneers and thought leaders there. The back-end network, which is largely based on a lot of compute-intensive and now AI-intensive workloads, also require the same focus on building a very purpose-built network, especially when you have a lot of small packets and large elephant flows, and you\u2019re dealing with a tremendous amount of metaverse applications and traffic. So, this is a new area that\u2019s historically, as Facebook indicated, been implemented with InfiniBand. But the 7800R3 has a unique opportunity to place its mark as the Ethernet fabric for these AI workloads with the right dynamic load balancing, with the efficient packet spring, with the congestion control in QRS. I\u2019ll turn it over to the master of the 7800. Anshul, you want to say more? Anshul Sadana : So, just a little bit more, Jayshree, did great job describing the attribute. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Anshul Sadana : Amit, Ethernet classically has had hotspots when you try to saturate it with all these types of flows and heavyweight traffic. But the 7800 can provide lost-less networking across all of these nodes, GPUs, CPUs, data sets being sliced around and chop it around, which is what creates the opportunity for us, especially with the 7800 and the product is doing fairly well in the new AI and spine use cases. Jayshree Ullal : And I would say, to answer your question, we are in the beginning of a new brand-new cycle and a new TAM because historically, Arista is new to this. And historically, it\u2019s traditionally been InfiniBand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I spoke with Juniper about their solution for data centers and campus, and they\u2019re seeing great growth in orders and you are having, of course, great results. The question I have here is, between the underlying growth of the market and share gains from Cisco, where is the answer to why suddenly this market is growing so much? Meaning, are we seeing, finally, Cisco starting to lose share more substantially than before, and this is why you\u2019re growing so much, or is it -- the answer is more about acceleration of growth in the market itself? And if that\u2019s the case, how do you look at it higher level, meaning what\u2019s the driver? Jayshree Ullal : Wow, Tal, you\u2019re making us really think about the answer. I tend to think of it as Arista\u2019s execution and our relevance to our customers has gotten higher and higher. Maybe that means the competition is getting weaker. But more than that, in the past, if you just look back three years ago, we were a data center company. If you look today, I think we have many, many more relevant components for the enterprise customer, whether it\u2019s campus, routing, data center interconnect, the data center itself, observability, monitoring, threat hunting, CloudVision and the entire operation analytics and agility. So, we have a better seat to the table for this modern set of workloads, where some of them are in the cloud and some of them are on the premise. And Arista is being sought out as not only the thought leader, but the advisor on how do they make this happen. So, I think that has really changed because of our product portfolio and because of the customer needing an alternative. As I said in my opening remarks, due to COVID, I think they\u2019ve also had a better planning horizon. They\u2019re increasingly more fatigued and frustrated with the existing players and they want an alternative. So, I think the timing and our relevance has both now improved in the last couple of years. Tal Liani : Got it. And Jayshree, do you think that market share shifts are explaining more now than before or no, or it\u2019s the same. It\u2019s more about the growth in the underlying market and your ability to deliver the right products to the right customers, but less about share shift? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think we are definitely gaining in our market share in the 100 gig and 400 gig in data center switching. The other market share shifts are still small because we\u2019re still a small player. Now, we have to work to get bigger. So, I wouldn\u2019t call them shifts, let\u2019s say, increased relevance on our side, but still small numbers. Ita Brennan : I mean I think, Tal, we\u2019re certainly seeing, I would say, good new logo, closure rates, et cetera, in that part of the business. I think that\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to comment on share, but I think there\u2019s definitely traction there. And you see it in our numbers, obviously. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Maybe building on that question from Tal. I guess, just from your enterprise customers, just curious as to whether organizations being basically forced into giving more visibility has made them more likely to be comfortable with architecture changes or really take a higher level kind of look at what they really want to be doing with their data center architectures that maybe they weren\u2019t comfortable with in kind of a normal course supply chain environment where they were just able to get product within a quarter? Just wondering if this is triggering kind of higher-level discussions with customers? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Meta, I think you\u2019re exactly right. I think that planning horizon is a lot better. In the past, they have a firefighting in the office. And today, when you have lead times that are so extended, they\u2019ve got a chance to think about alternatives. Also the CIO is extremely pressured to think about the cloud and what workloads they put on the cloud and what they put on the premise. So, I think the overall enterprise architecture and redesign is well underway and Arista is a benefactor of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, if we could look further out, one concern that quite a number of investors have is the runway for both Microsoft and Facebook, and the respective 400-gig and 200-gig builds. And I recognize the world is probably not nearly as binary as many of us in the investment community think. But any insight you could share on the runway for those bills and on what\u2019s next, assuming that at some point they hit peak levels flatten out and eventually roll over? Jayshree Ullal : Well, look, we\u2019re used to volatility from our Cloud Titan customers. We experienced the highs of 2018 and then the lows of 2019 and \u201820. So, we\u2019re in a period where the Cloud Titans are clearly investing from a CapEx. And increasingly, we are more directly correlated to their network CapEx. Anshul, do you want to shed more light on that? Anshul Sadana : Absolutely, Jayshree. I think the Cloud Titans have a very strong business model, which is resulting in the investments they are making. So, there\u2019s real strength there to move on. Number two, all of these customers are planning fairly well. So, we appreciate the visibility. And it\u2019s very clear, they\u2019re not trying to stock these products in the warehouse. They absolutely need them to go live into their network. So, the buildouts are very real. Paul, if we had visibility for two or three years, we would be delighted, but we should be happy of visibility for one year. So let\u2019s not go beyond that. But for the near term, we believe the demand is strong. Paul Silverstein : All right. Ita Brennan : What we\u2019re thinking, Paul, is what we\u2019re seeing consistently across all our Cloud Titan customers and, in fact, some of the specialty cloud customers, is their -- all their upgrades are in full swing, right? They\u2019re all investing. Additionally, we are putting more megawatt data center capacity annually every year. And so, we think this is a multiyear upgrade. But we obviously can\u2019t see much beyond 2022 right now, but we\u2019ll let you know as we do. Paul Silverstein : But Jayshree, I know you\u2019ve made the point in the past about AI build-outs involving far greater infrastructure consuming far greater bandwidth. And I assume, Meta, while it gets all the focus understandably from all of us, it\u2019s not the only and it won\u2019t be the last such buildout. But if I could get a clarification from Ita on something she said earlier. When cloud dominated your revenue earlier after you went public back in \u201814, you were doing 64% to 65-plus percent gross margin back then. I understand things change over time. But with cloud likely to increase as a percentage of revenue over the course of next year and you\u2019re cautioning about the impact that customer mix impact on gross margin, why would it be different than what we saw back when, what\u2019s changed? Ita Brennan : Yes. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things in there, right? I think if you go back to what we said at Analyst Day, which was, look, we could grow 30% with reasonable growth rates across the business and be in that kind of 63% to 65% range, right? And I think that\u2019s still the case. I think that the script guidance is more saying, if we\u2019re able to accelerate beyond that and we really accelerate on the cloud piece of the business, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see it kind of threaten the bottom end of that range and maybe -- and go below that. It\u2019s a different environment in terms of the cost structure and some of the cost inputs that we\u2019re dealing with, et cetera. I think it\u2019s -- you have to -- you have to think about the different cost increases, logistics costs, et cetera, that we\u2019re dealing with now. And the flexibility just isn\u2019t there in the same way as it was back then. I mean, we\u2019ve done a really good job I think and the team has done a really good job of optimizing gross margin over time. Right? But now, your degrees of freedom are less, right? So I think it\u2019s a tighter cost structure to deal with and then it\u2019s a growing cloud presence. And again, we\u2019re just saying, okay, in that scenario, you could see some pressure on the bottom end of that range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : First question is maybe you could just frame for us how many uncaptured revenue opportunities have been created in 2022 as a function of some of the supply chain disruptions and disconnects? And just a quick follow-up after that is we kind of see the Microsoft and Meta buildup as 10%-plus customers, but are there any third or fourth potential customers that are ramping up their network in a way that they could become 10% plus over the next two to three years that you guys are seeing? And we don\u2019t need to know who. We just need to know if it\u2019s in the cards. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Your second question is a little easier to answer. At the moment, there\u2019s a lot of activity with all the Cloud Titans, but no one substantially bid like Microsoft is today and Meta will be. Maybe we can find another M Cloud Titan customer to find that. As to your question on how many opportunities? I mean, it\u2019s almost a theoretical question, Sami, because we go into this, engaging with all our customers and some happen right away. In fact, I heard today of a customer that we engaged with five years ago that we just won. So, some happen in five weeks and some happened in five years. So we really don\u2019t have an exact precise answer on that ratio. But we just hope it keeps increasing because we\u2019ve got plenty of time and TAM to serve it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you. And Jayshree and Ita, if you take a step back, say, three months ago when we had our last call compared to now, can you let us know what end markets or verticals really compressed you both, not only in the results, but maybe the bookings? You mentioned you\u2019re getting a lot more visibility now. I\u2019m just kind of wondering about your end markets. What\u2019s really impressed you and surprised to the upside the most versus three months ago? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jim. I would say I\u2019m pleasantly surprised with the entire year, not necessarily Q3 and Q4. I think the level of activity on enterprise has been something we\u2019re very proud of. At the same time, our preferred partnership status with both Cloud Titans and some of the specialty cloud providers is we just -- the team is just executing very, very well. And if anything, while Arista doesn\u2019t tend to boast about backlog and orders and order strength, I am most proud of the execution that despite all of those happy capabilities, executing that and translating into revenue is a pleasant surprise from Q3 to Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I\u2019m going to build off that last comment, Jayshree, on kind of the backlog. And as you guys contemplated the 30% growth guidance for the full year, you\u2019ve got both backlog build up and you\u2019ve got also -- either you\u2019ve got some deferred revenue build that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters. That 30% revenue growth guidance that you\u2019ve laid out, do you assume that you carry a similar amount of backlog coming out of the calendar year as well as deferred revenue and product, or do you expect that 30% to be somewhat driven by fulfilling against that backlog that you\u2019ve seen? Ita Brennan : Yes. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to get into the whole backlog bookings conversation. I mean, it\u2019s just so hard for it to be meaningful right now given the lead times and what\u2019s been happening with lead times, et cetera. I think on the deferred revenue, I would say, look, it\u2019s not our intention right now that that deferred balance would feed the 30%. We\u2019ll see how that goes as we go to the quarter, but we\u2019re not assuming right now that that\u2019s coming off the balance sheet. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think it\u2019s fair. I think, the broader thing to take away is demand is strong. Execution could be stronger if we had supply chain resolution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex Henderson : It\u2019s a pleasure to get one in. I\u2019m hoping you could talk to us about the broad problem that I think confronts all of the analysts who follow this category, which is that if you look at the orders at Extreme, Cisco, Juniper and your 25%-plus growth in \u201821 and 30% growth in \u201822 forecasted. It\u2019s clearly a substantially higher rate of growth than at any time that this industry has produced since even probably the tech bubble. And so, there\u2019s got to be a resolution to this environment, which is a return towards normalized growth, which I think, if you exclude the titans, it\u2019s probably in the 0% to 5% vicinity. And if you include the titans, it\u2019s probably no more than 5% to 10% vicinity and -- which is what gave you rise to guidance of 10% to 15% with some share gains. How do we resolve this environment that we\u2019re in now with backlogs 30% to 50% at a number of companies? Does it all roll over into down orders at some point? Obviously, you don\u2019t have that backlog problem. But could you help us understand how to resolve 30% to 50% type quarter growth and industry 0% to 5%? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I\u2019ll try to answer. I think it\u2019s a very thoughtful question, Alex, that will this period of extreme growth continue forever? And the answer is no. Nothing continues forever. Every party has a beginning and an end. However, for Arista, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity. I just want to clarify that independent of the Cloud Titan CapEx spend, I believe we can enjoy a double-digit growth for quite some time to come in the non-Cloud Titan space. So, I just want to make sure you understand that independent of this extreme enthusiasm and excitement era we\u2019re in, Arista has a foundation to keep growing double digits for multiple years to come. Now, I do think we\u2019re in a -- because of lead times and the frenzy and people are looking and planning and visibility is greater for us, and I think this will continue not only in 2021 and 2022, but will continue into 2023. We\u2019ll probably, and this is just a pure speculation on my part, settle into a more normal growth thereafter. But even so, we don\u2019t wish for that growth to be in single digits. We\u2019ll be working hard for that to be much faster. Alex Henderson : If I could just follow up on it. So, do you think that as this occurs, the orders that some of the other companies that have run these large backlogs start to roll over to reconcile? I mean, this is way above normal. Ita Brennan : But Alex, it\u2019s a compression of time as well, right? Instead of having visibility to a quarter, you\u2019ve got visibility to do a period much, much longer, right? That\u2019s why you have to stay focused on deployments and how all of this going to get deployed. It\u2019s not all going to get deployed at the same rate as it\u2019s booking. That\u2019s for sure, right? So I think you have to think about. That\u2019s why we keep trying to focus on deployments with customers and when will stuff actually get deployed because the bookings number is more a factor of time and the planning horizon than it is anything else, right? Yes. It\u2019s a really good point. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik Suppiger : Two questions. One, in the campus business, can you comment a little bit about how much new logo business you\u2019re seeing? Is that doing what you want, or how do you feel that\u2019s progressing? And then secondly, I think the Microsoft business was 21% in \u201821. And I think you said it came down to 15%. The question is, is the overall titan business holding up? Is that the incremental downshift there being spread out across other titans, or is that being carried more by the enterprise business that you\u2019re making up for that? Jayshree Ullal : Erik, Anshul is going to answer the second question while I look over the campus data. Erik Suppiger : Okay. Anshul Sadana : So, as we mentioned right at the start of the year, we expected many of these new products, new technologies to be deployed second half of the year and especially the 7800, the 7388 was launched in November of last year. So, they were somewhat back-end loaded. Other than that, demand has been healthy and strong. So, there\u2019s a little bit of timing gap there more related supply of new products and technology. But there\u2019s nothing else to worry about within the cloud business. We believe they will be a strong contributor going forward. Jayshree Ullal : And to answer campus questions -- to answer the Campus question, I don\u2019t have exact numbers, but a good rule of thumb for you to think of is about half our customers came from existing and half came from new prospects. And we\u2019re getting many, many new logos, obviously, that we\u2019re just starting with. So some of them start small and they\u2019ll get even bigger this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Thanks. And happy Valentine\u2019s Day to the entire team here? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Same to you. James Fish : I\u2019m convinced you guys like spending Q4 earnings with us on Valentine\u2019s Day to avoid your spouses a bit. Anyway, going back to Alex\u2019s question, given your comments around increased visibility for \u201822 and actually, Jayshree, you pointed out 2023 possibly. Can you guys help us kind of quantify how much of the business you actually have visibility into today? And is it really just the titans? And how are you thinking about that kind of potential net pull-in effect of demand in orders in the second half of the year or 2023 into what we\u2019re seeing to today? Jayshree Ullal : Well, let me just separate the question you\u2019re asking, James. The titans, we historically had 1 or 2 quarters. And now we\u2019re saying we have at least a year. That\u2019s a huge factor in our planning. It\u2019s also the volume of purchase we have to make, the projects, et cetera. On the enterprise, we\u2019ve always enjoyed longer-term visibility. It\u2019s always been 6 to 12 months. So, I would say, in general, one year is our visibility right now on projects. Not too much longer than that and not too much less than that. It\u2019s just enjoying the benefit of greater visibility on the titans is what\u2019s really changed. James Fish : And on the potential for net pull-in of demand here from 2023 into 2022? Ita Brennan : It kind of comes back to the deployments, James, where it\u2019s -- they\u2019re not telling us they\u2019re going to deploy it all tomorrow, they\u2019re laying out kind of project plans and deployment plans over time, right? So, it\u2019s not so much that these orders are pull-ins. It\u2019s more we\u2019re working with them to figure out when stuff needs and can be deployed, right? And that\u2019s going to be a solution of their orders but also the supply and when stuff can be deployed, right? Jayshree Ullal : Let\u2019s take a campus example. Invariably, it\u2019s a new building they\u2019re putting in or a new project they have. The project is most likely to be second half 2022 or early 2023, but they\u2019re planning now. So, that happens all the time. That\u2019s not new. Ita Brennan : That\u2019s not pull-ins, per se, from a revenue and a business perspective, right? They\u2019re just giving visibility. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. I would -- one thing I would want to reiterate is the planning horizon and the planning time and the think time on this has gotten a lot larger because of the lead time issue. They never used to worry about it. They were doing just-in-time planning and now they have to do one year planning. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Ben Bollin : Ita, I had a question for you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the $2.8 billion in your non-cancelable purchase commitments. Could you share any details on how you see that? How the timing of that comes in over time from a component perspective? How you think it might influence the risk of decommits? And could you comment at all about what you think spiked the decommits in January? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean the $2.8 billion, there is a big piece of that that\u2019s kind of -- some of the key components that we\u2019ve always buffered and we\u2019ve extended kind of the period of time that we\u2019re buffering for. So, the -- some of the chips and other things that just are new chips for new products, relatively low excess obsolete risk and difficult to secure, and we are making kind of investments there to do that. So, there\u2019s -- at least 50% or more is tied up in that, right? And that -- those will come in and we\u2019ll hold them and we\u2019ll use them when we need to use them. The rest of the class other components because what we\u2019ve seen is, it\u2019s not just about the key components anymore, right? We have to get ourselves involved in other components, broader set of components across the supply chain because you need 100% of the BAM [ph] in order to be able to ship, right? And it\u2019s kind of you see decommits. The decommits are not, we would have considered key components before. They\u2019re just smaller components embedded in the BAM. So, we\u2019re taking a broader view of that, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen that step up happen again this quarter. In terms of when it gets received, I mean, the chips and stuff will come in. I mean, they will come in and will hold them. So, you\u2019ll see a fair amount of that turn in 2022 because of that, just because it\u2019s the components that we\u2019re going to hold. Jayshree Ullal : I just want to add, Ben, that what Anshul, John McCool, Susan Hayes, the entire team has done is they\u2019ve historically had to focus on 5 or 10 strategic vendors. I think that number has gone up 10x to 50 to 70. So, the relationships we now have to maintain, keep and understand and appropriately design our products and wait for their timing has gone up by 7 to 10x. And therefore, we have to make more purchase commitments and plans for them for a longer duration of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I just want to keep going on, on the question of purchase commitments. We ran a little exercise where we looked at the combo of your inventory and your purchase commitments. And we tried to compare those to our estimate for your next 12-month hardware cost of goods sold. And granted, this is from Q3 ending and the numbers are much higher at Q4 and -- but we came up with like 281% of your next 12-month hardware cost of goods sold estimated. And -- so I guess, the question in this is you guys seem to be so far out in terms of magnitude relative to all the other companies in the space in terms of how far ahead you\u2019re getting on inventory and purchase commits. Like is this -- are we just grossly underestimating how much business you guys are looking at in the next 12 months, or are you anticipating some real adverse changes in the supply chain? Like, what\u2019s your perspective on that? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. George, I think it comes back to thinking about the components again and where the kind of -- where the value of the BAM is and the commitments we\u2019re willing to make around some of those key components. So, they\u2019re not necessarily going to be consumed in this coming year, but we are willing to kind of take control of those components by making those commitments. And again, it\u2019s early life products, early life silicon, and we believe that that\u2019s a relatively safe bet and it\u2019s the cost of capital really that we\u2019re tying up. So, I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s not that everything that we\u2019ve got purchase commitments out for now will be consumed, shipped and revenue in 2022. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Notwithstanding some recent operational issues at Meta, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on how sort of double-digit data center expansion, both at Microsoft and Facebook this year plays into your sort of revenue visibility in the balance of this year and then how that plays into 2023. Obviously, there are some delays in terms of qualification and when revenue would be in the books in 2022 from last year. But just trying to get a sense for how we should think about that in \u201822 and \u201823, given their aggressive pace of investment? Thanks. Anshul Sadana : Sure. David, Jayshree and Ita mentioned, we took a lot of time at the Analyst Day and today to go over 30% growth plans. And both of these customers are very significant parts of our business. One is already greater than a 10% customer. The other one will likely get there soon. So, we have taken their strength into our models and into our guidance already. We believe the demand is healthy. As you\u2019ve mentioned, they are investing very well across the entire world and new build-outs and data centers with new technology -- and we are clearly the preferred partner they\u2019ve had and they continue to have in networking. So, we\u2019ll benefit with that as well. So to some extent, this makes up for the lack of growth in 2019 or 2020, now with this new cycle, and really enjoy the growth with them. David Vogt : Just as a quick follow-up. What percentage of that do you think spills into 2023, if let\u2019s say, Microsoft is delayed in terms of -- or back-end weighted in terms of building out 400 gig in their data centers this year? Anshul Sadana : Probably hard to model all the volatility we have with supply. I think, right now, demand is strong. So it\u2019s really tied to supply of products. And these customers have enough other ways they can figure how to deploy technology if they give them enough heads up. So, that\u2019s lesser of a concern right now. Venk Nathamuni : Thanks, Anshul, and thanks, David. This concludes Arista Networks Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. We have posted a supplemental presentation, which provides additional information on our results. And you can access that on the Investors section of our website. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stein, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2022. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2022 fiscal year; longer-term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond; our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities; the potential impact of COVID-19, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing capacity, inventory purchases and inflationary pressures on our business, product innovation and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documentation filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. In addition to the pandemic, we are now facing the global uncertainty with the war in Ukraine and increasing inflation trends. On behalf of Arista, we express our deep concern over the tragedies in Ukraine and thank the Arista employees for their thoughtful donations to the Ukraine Humanitarian Causes matched by the Arista Foundation. Back to Q1 2022. We delivered record revenues of $877.1 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84. Services, software support renewals contributed approximately 19.2% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 63.9% was influenced by continuing supply chain constraints and elevated costs. Vendor decommits for certain components increased sharply in March 2022, with no clear relief in sight in the near term. In terms of Q1 2022 verticals, Cloud Titans was our strongest and largest vertical, followed by enterprise, cloud specialty providers and financials tied at third place, and service providers at fourth. Our geographical mix included strong performance in the Americas at 76%, with the international contribution at 24%. According to market analysts, in calendar 2021, Arista gained market share in overall data center, high-performance switching growing to approximately 19% market share. We are proud to maintain our #1 position in 100-, 200- and 400-gig switching and achieved this growth despite all the challenges of the supply chain. Arista has also been a pioneer and leader in client to cloud networking. Our customer relevance is increasing with new logos in tech enterprises, health care, education and retail as well as the provider sector. Our million-dollar logos have doubled in the last 3 years in all categories. These categories include : greater than 1 million, greater than 5 million, greater than 10 million and greater than 25 million customers. What's clear as I personally engaged across the worldwide base of CIOs and CXOs is that the planning horizon for networking has really changed. Our visibility and demand has never been stronger. The nature of our discussions with our customers is also most strategic in nature. Let me try to illustrate with a few examples. For example, on AI Spine, we're building upon our cloud heritage to expand scale for AI workloads that are both data and compute-intensive, thereby requiring 100-, 400- and 800-gig performance in the future with rich EOS software feature. In the cognitive campus, threat hunting is now becoming integral to the network instead of being an [indiscernible] and is changing the way cybersecurity and virulent threats can be detected and managed holistically. Network security is clearly migrating to secure zero-trust networking based on AI and AVA sensors. In larger enterprises, network as a sales service based on CloudVision is enabling our customers to manage their data sets across client-to-cloud domains with superior, unmatched automation and analytics. Our decade-long preferred partnership with Cloud Titans, especially Microsoft and Meta, has helped forge joint engineering products for hyper cloud scale all the way now to Edge use cases.  Clearly, Arista is in the midst of an exciting and growing total available market or TAM expansion to fulfill our customers' quest for proactive, predictive and prescriptive networking, all this with the right data-driven foundation and architecture. This Network Data Lake EOS stack that we launched last November, is resonating well, and it's validating our customer network design. In conclusion, I'm so proud of Arista's progress and traction and look forward to multiple years of double-digit growth. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for Q1 2022 financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 '22 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were $877.1 million, up 31.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $840 million to $860 million. Our enterprise business continued to contribute healthily to our overall revenue growth in the first quarter, combined with accelerated shipments to our cloud titan customers, some of which were deferred. Supply remained constrained in the quarter with supplier decommits resulting in higher broker purchases and expedite fees in the period. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 19.2% of revenue in the first quarter, down from 21% in Q4. International revenues for the quarter came in at $212.7 million or 24% of total revenue, down from an unusually high 29% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This decline in international mix primarily reflects some volatility with our global customers, including the deferral of some international cloud shipments in the period. Overall gross margin in Q1 was 63.9%, above the midpoint of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 64%. Operating expenses for the quarter were $225.3 million or 25.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $206.2 million. R&D spending came in at $144.3 million or 16.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $130.3 million. This primarily reflected increased headcount and higher new product introduction costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $66.2 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $61.2 million last quarter, with increased headcount and strong shipments driving higher variable compensation expenses for the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $14.8 million or 1.7% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $335.6 million or 38.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $3 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 20.7%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $268.7 million or 30.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 319.7 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $0.84, up approximately 35% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased $136.2 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $116 per share. As a reminder, we've now repurchased approximately $209 million or 1.8 million shares against our October 2021 $1 billion Board authorization. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases is dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. Now turning to operating cash performance for the first quarter. We generated $217.1 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting strong earnings performance, combined with continued working capital investments. DSOs came in at 67 days, up from 58 days in Q4, reflecting the linearity of billings and growth in deferred revenue in the period. Inventory turns were consistent with last quarter at 1.7x. Inventory increased to $694.2 million in the quarter, up from $650.1 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting higher component inventory. Our purchase commitment number for the quarter was $4.3 billion, up from $2.8 billion in Q4. The significant increase in commitments largely represents orders for 2023 and beyond, reflecting overall strength and demand for those periods and our expectation that this long lead time supply environment continues. As a reminder, we continue to prioritize newer, early life-cycled products for inclusion of these strategies in order to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1.1 billion, up from $929 million in Q4. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services-related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $327 million of this balance, up from $160 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our large Cloud Titan customers. As a reminder, we remain in a period of significant new product introductions combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends have resulted in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 58 days, down from 63 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $14.9 million. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. Our Analyst Day outlook for 2022 calls for 30% year-over-year revenue growth, somewhat balanced across our market sectors and heavily constrained by the supply environment. As we progress through 2022, demand metrics remain strong across the business with particular strength from our Cloud Titan, other cloud and enterprise customers. While we've added manufacturing capacity and component supply in response to this demand, supplier decommits make forecasting accelerated shipment momentum difficult. These decommits also have a negative impact on gross margin as we must turn to other sources to try to backfill decommitted components in the quarter. From a business model perspective, this means that in this supply-constrained environment, any accelerated growth, while accretive to the bottom line, may come with a lower gross margin percentage due to increased cloud mix and additional expedite fees. Turning specifically to Q2. We expect revenues of approximately $950 million to $1 billion, including approximately $50 million of cloud-related deferred revenue recognition from the balance sheet. On the gross margin front, an expected healthy cloud mix in the quarter, combined with 200 to 300 basis points of assumed expedite costs would result in gross margins of approximately 60% to 62%. As to spending and investments, we expect to continue to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing in line with our baseline investment plan. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $950 million to $1 billion, gross margin of approximately 60% to 62% and operating margins of approximately 37% to 38%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% with diluted shares on a post-split basis of approximately 320 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : I have one clarification and then one question. First thing is, Ita, you talked about customer acceptance clauses. Can you just expand a little bit on that just because you do have some deferred revenue, and it sounds like there's a lot moving around. Could you just define or maybe just elaborate a little bit more on that for specifically midyear 2022? And then my actual question is when we -- when you talk to your actual suppliers, what do they actually tell you is the reason for the decommits? And when they do decommit, how many days before the actual planned delivery date are they decommitting by? Ita Brennan : I'll take the deferred revenue question first, right? I mean, obviously, in time periods where you have lots of new products and you're bringing new products to these larger customers, in particular, to completely new customers, they don't have the opportunity to test everything about the product in their environment. And we can't mimic those large-scale environments. So we have customer acceptances where we give them the time period to accept the products, so we can ship, bill and collect cash on those, but it's deferred from a revenue perspective because there are some criteria that we need to prove that we satisfy so that they can give us the acceptance. Jayshree Ullal : And Sami, to answer your question, the decommits come literally the week we are expecting the components. So they surprise us, right, when we're looking to build them, which is why we struggled, frankly, in the back half of the quarter not getting the components we needed and just having a lot of our contract manufacturing capacity waiting on key components. And the only way to resolve that was to pay extra expedites by orders of magnitude to get them. Sometimes we could get them, and sometimes we couldn't. So we believe this very constrained environment of components combined with decommits is going to continue into Q2 and who knows about Q3. And John McCool, as our Head of Manufacturing and Platforms, you have more to add to that? John McCool : Sure. Just the nature of the decommits, I think that we see very part specific reasons for each of those decommits. Some can be tester capacity, yield, logistics issues as the suppliers work through that. So I wouldn't say there's any generic means for those decommits. It really depends on what part and what supplier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Fahad Najam : Jayshree, last time, you said that you had the best visibility that you've ever seen. You pretty much said that you had visibility for the entire calendar '22. So I'm assuming you are already having conversations with your customers about the demand picture maybe setting the calendar '22. So can you present a little bit of a color on the dynamics you are seeing with your customers regarding the -- maybe calendar '22? And maybe if you can quantify what do you mean by the best visibility that you have -- that you're having? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Fahad. Last quarter, our visibility was very strong for 2022. This quarter, our visibility continues to be very strong for 2023. But I would also add that, in particular, the Cloud Titans and some enterprises are starting to plan for 2023. They have to start thinking about it now that we're in Q2 here. So all this to suggest that the demand is strong for this year. We expect demand to be strong at least for the first half of next year from a planning purposes. Things could always change, orders could always be moved around. But in all my career across Cisco and perhaps even others I have never seen demand be so clearly purposed and strong. Anshul, do you want to add more to that? Anshul Sadana : Sure, Jayshree, I think customers are no longer struggling to understand that supply chain is constrained. They very well understand it. Many of these cloud companies build their own compute and storage as well. So they're planning along with their own teams for 2023 right now. And their businesses are good, which means the underlying demand is strong. Fahad Najam : If I could follow up, one, on the deferred revenue from cloud, was it more -- it's just 1 cloud titan customer. Can you help us understand, is that a function of your cloud customers' ability to digest your supply into them? Anything you can help us understand on the dynamics and so we can model appropriately the Titan revenue kinds going forward? Ita Brennan : Yes. No, I think it's across multiple customers. And again, it's very standard for us if you look back historically to have periods at the beginnings of product life cycles where we're shipping the product. They're deploying the product, but we're just waiting for that kind of acceptance so that we can actually take the revenue from a rev rec perspective, right? So it's not unusual for us to see this. You'll have seen that over time. What we said was we built deferred in Q1, and then we will draw down about $50 million in Q2, but we're still up roughly $110 million for the first half from a product deferred revenue perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Just a quick question and then a follow-up. So maybe just on the vendor commits and what you're seeing from your CMs. Relative to 90 days ago, can you just kind of share with us a little bit more color in terms of what\u2019s been the impact? Is it the recent lockdowns that we've seen from supply chain partners in Asia or in other parts of the world? Or is it just simply a reduction in availability and mismatched components that would make a complete set effectively? And then just quickly on a follow-up. You mentioned, Ita, I think you had mentioned 200 to 300 basis points of expedited costs in the gross margin. Does that include sort of the mix shift to a more hyperscaler mix as well in the guidance for Q2 or does that -- or is that just a separate cost in terms of how your gross margins are going to play out for the rest of the year? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think the 200 to 300 basis points is really looking at kind of an estimate, if you like, of what we think those decommits could cost us. So that's separate to the customer mix, et cetera. It's really being driven more by kind of looking at kind of the decommits that we saw end of last quarter, beginning of this quarter, and then what's the impact for that. So it's separate to the customer mix. John McCool : Yes. So I would say on the supply chain piece, I think we've kind of seen a more pointed or focused issue really around semiconductors in general. That's still led by the supply-demand imbalance. And I think in terms of particulars on decommitys, again, each part, each device has a separate story. We've seen some suppliers that are trying to increase test capacity, don't have test equipment. They're waiting for orders that are also constrained by semiconductors, some perturbation with the lockdowns in China for raw material and equipment. So it's across the board and very specific to each device. Jayshree Ullal : And I think it's safe to -- just to clarify also that, it's safe to also say it changed a lot since our last call. So we have a couple of vendors that are causing a lot of gaps for our decommits. We don't want to name them because I know they're working hard to improve their commitment to us, but 2 or 3 vendors have -- David Vogt : Was there any competitive issue in the decommits? Or that wasn't the issue, meaning that maybe there's some allocation issues between yourself and some of your competitors? Jayshree Ullal : No. Not that we know of. David Vogt : That just pumped in the cycle. Jayshree Ullal : No, none that we're aware of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I guess I wanted to come back -- first of all, thank you, Ita, for clarifying the deferred revenue release in the guide. That's a helpful number. I'm just trying to come back, I was looking at your deferred revenue in aggregate over time. And obviously, very inflated here. Curious what you think the time line for reducing that kind of back to some sort of a normal level is? I know it's very hard to predict, but just based on what you know today, is that likely to happen this year? Does it take 24 months? If you could gauge that for us. And then also, we don't really know what the backlog, the order backlog looks like. I don't know if you could quantify that at all for us. So kind of a few different areas of questions there, I guess. Ita Brennan : Yes. I think on the deferred revenue, like I said, I don't really like to forecast, but we will call out when we think we're drawing it down in the guidance. So that's the reference to the $50 million. I think at this point, I don't think we would draw down to achieve a 30% growth rate. Obviously, this is turning and turning all the time, right? But we think that balance doesn't come down year-over-year in our assumptions for the 30% growth rate. I think on the order backlog, I'll let Jayshree comment as well. But for me, at this point, with the impact of time, et cetera, on the backlog, it's not a meaningful number for us to share. It's not a means of metric to share. I don't know if you have any -- Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No Rod, we've stayed away from order strength and backlogs. These don't mean anything unless we can ship it. So we'll continue to keep telling you about our visibility and demand in a qualitative fashion, but in a quantitative fashion, the only number that matters is shipments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess my question is really around, if I heard the purchase commitment number correctly, I think it was $4.3 billion. It was up a fair bit sequentially, and I'm sure the math is not linear on purchase commitments, but could you maybe just help me connect the dot between the $4.3 billion purchase commitment versus what, I think, TTM cost of goods sold is on $1.2 billion. Are you locking in supply on a multiyear basis? Or do you really see a sustainability of this current 30% growth to be a lot more durable versus perhaps that you talked about at the Analyst Day? Just put in context, it seems like a sizable number over here versus the growth rate. Jayshree Ullal : No. Yes. Yes, Amit, good observation. I think we jumped it from $2.8 billion to $4-plus billion. And you're absolutely right, this is a multiyear commitment now. This is not just for '22. It's also for '23 and perhaps it leads into '24 as well. Given the extended lead times that are only getting worse, and we wanted to make sure we secured our commitments. So we're placing a bet on long-term demand, a multiyear double-digit growth and accordingly planning for it. And so you don't need to read any more or any less on to it, except we're bullish about demand and we're planning for multiple years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if you could maybe describe what the time line is like for your sales into a hyperscale data center. Basically, what I'm trying to get a sense of is, from the day they begin construction, how long does it take for them to make purchases from you in terms of initial deployment and then upgrades? So if you reflect back on your experience, how would you spread out the spending for a given hyperscale data center over a period of a number of years? Hopefully, that makes sense -- Jayshree Ullal : Yes, it actually does make sense because I think there's a period of planning and build-out and what they want to do, then there's actually putting a design on what they're going to do. And then there's the deployment. Anshul, you are so smack in the middle of this. This is yours to answer. Anshul Sadana : Sure, absolutely, Jayshree. When we work with our Cloud Titans, they think of regions. And the build-out in different regions, different geos is sometimes different. So you cannot actually just take a regional buildout and say this will always be the same. In many of the major regions, which are hundreds of megawatts or sometimes gigawatts, the DCI network needs to be built first before racks can be added. In some of the smaller or midsized regions, they can actually start with racks and DCI can grow over time as well. But net-net, these are generally about 2- to 3-year planning cycles for the customer. And as equipment or supply is showing up last minute, they decide where they would deploy it the network. So we don't really control the last part, but the planning is really 2 to 3 years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Jason Ader : And I'm not going to ask a question about deferred revenue or supply. So you'll be happy to hear that. My question is on the enterprise side. You guys continue to do well there. Wondering if your ability to deliver supply faster than some of your competitors has made a difference. Maybe I don't know even know that's true, but if you can comment on that. And also whether subscription software mandates from some of your competitors is helping you win business? And any examples of that would be great. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No. Thank you, Jason, for stirring us the repeat question. If you step back and look at our enterprise momentum, I'd say it's really picked up steam in the last 3 years. In some cases, I think we're now larger than stand-alone companies with our enterprise business who've been around 25 years. I think the reason our enterprise business is growing so well is really 3 reasons, and probably very little to do with the fact that we can supply products sooner. They all wish we could do it earlier. It has to do with an architectural approach that is different now, especially post-COVID, for our campus and data centers, where they want to build off 1 EOS, 1 cloud vision and 1 leaf spine architecture. So they're really coming to us for a different design approach, whereas historically, it was rinse and repeat. So that makes a huge difference. The second is their experience with us in the case of existing customers, where they've had such good quality, lower critical vulnerabilities and experience with us that they really want to take that across the network, client to cloud in many more use cases. And the third, I think, is what you alluded to. There is a lot of fatigue and frustration from our industry peers who've been going one way and only one way and seeing a better alternative, both from a technology and consumption point of view, where we're not forcing them down a subscription and we're giving them options. They can have it as a service or they could buy perpetually, it's the customers' choice. I think all of this has helped really cement our enterprise momentum, at least with the high-end enterprise adopters. We've got a long way to go in the mid-market. But certainly, I would say that's the case for the enterprise high-end customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : I guess a couple of 2 related questions. What's the value of purchase commitments in an age of decommits? And I guess I'm trying to think about pricing and the impact on the gross margin, Ita, going to -- or your guidance on gross margin. Why not move to a model, just an operating model for the foreseeable future until things change, whereby certain parts of your pricing are just variable and you price things to the customer as you get price yourself? Or why not roll this over? And I know you can do increases every quarter, but just have like an empty box on an invoice that gets filled in as you purchase components? And I don't think clients would be overly surprised that something like this happens. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, we need to recruit you into our procurement department. Ita Brennan : I think my billings team might be a little confused. Jayshree Ullal : Good question, Ita. Where to start? Yes. So I think on the pricing side of things, Ita, we'll start to benefit from the last price increase really kind of in Q4, really December, maybe a little bit before that. But that's -- that price increase is rolling through. Yes, price increases are hard, right? I mean, we will -- we'll look and consider when we see sustained costs where we need to pass them on, and we'll do that. But price increases are tough to do. They do kind of impact the customer. So we'll look and see if we need to do another one and how sustained some of these cost increases are and then we'll decide based on that. But we should start to see some benefit from the prior one having burned through the backlog, et cetera, in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Sorry to bring it back to deferred revenue. But just a point of clarification, Ita. You had noted last quarter that the 30% kind of outlook for the year didn't include kind of recognition of any of the deferred revenue balance. But obviously, the deferred revenue balance kind of grew by quite a bit. And so I just want to clarify that the 30% is without kind of where we were at the beginning of the year on deferred revenue or even where we are now or will be at the end of kind of Ita Brennan : Yes. I think, Meta, the commentary around not drawing it down is really an annual statement year-over-year, right? But what you saw us do for Q1 was obviously grow at $167 million. We'll draw down $50 million of that. But I think the best way to think about it as the first half, right? We'll be up $110 million from our product deferred revenue at the end of Q2 based on our guidance, right? So we're building it, and I don't think we draw it down versus the beginning of the year, at least, and we'll see what happens in the second half. It's very hard to forecast it precisely. But again, I think the 30% did not contemplate us picking anything out of the opening year deferred revenue balance. Meta Marshall : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a small follow-up. I mean, obviously, the inventory balance has grown by a fair amount. Just wanted to get a sense of, are there any concerns around obsolescence of any of that inventory? Or just as it takes longer to get all of the parts? Or is that not a confirm we should be mindful of? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, I guess the inventory balance itself isn't up that much, right? It's up a little bit on the raw materials, but not a ton because obviously, we're shipping everything we have and that we can. I mean the purchase commitment balance is up a chunk, but I think again, that's time-bound more than anything else, right? I mean we're really looking through 2023 now and making commitments for that. And again, we're trying to pick the right products, won't necessarily be perfect, but we're definitely taking a risk approach there, and we're doing it in conjunction with customers. So that's -- I think that's what we have to do right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul Silverstein : At the risk of asking questions that you either cannot or will not answer, first off, I'm hoping, Jayshree, that you or Anshul or somebody could provide any incremental insight regarding the Microsoft-Meta announcement. And secondly, looking at the numbers, your first quarter results and second quarter guidance, that's almost 35% year-over-year growth. To do a 30% outstanding guidance for '22, that translates to about 26% growth for the second half of the year, and you're talking about the best demand environment you've ever seen. I appreciate we're only 1 quarter into the year, I get it. But it sure sounds like you're, supply permitting, that you could do well north of 30%. I'm hoping to provide some insight on that. And is the growth just a result of backlog or is it all just -- Jayshree Ullal : So to help you answer the Microsoft partnership, you may have seen the quote in our earnings release. We consider Microsoft a very strategic and preferred partner, and so do they of us. The use cases are expanding. And of course, that, like I've always said, doesn't mean we get 100% of the use cases for the business. They've always had multi-vendor and open. And from time to time, they've chosen other partners for other use cases. So it doesn't change at all our status with them, but obviously means they're going to always be multi-vendor and open. Anshul , you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Paul, our relationship with Microsoft is so long and so deep. We worked with them not just for our current product, but for several generations to come. And the discussions on paper span all they way up to 2025-2027 architecture, what can be possible, what we build for them. So that leadership position we've had will continue. As Jayshree mentioned, they can be multi-stores, but we believe we'll stay in a healthy position, and we're not going to get distracted by this announcement. Ita? Ita Brennan : Yes. And then, Paul, I guess, coming back to the growth, I mean, yes, you're right, it was close to 35% for the first half. I think we would have an outlook of 30% for the second half. So I'm not necessarily saying we're going to decelerate off of 30%, but it's all about supply, right? If we could solve for these handful of components that are kind of causing these decommits, yes, we could do some more, right? But for now, I think we just have to respect that and the uncertainty of that and be cautious. Paul Silverstein : Can I just ask a quick clarification Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Paul Silverstein : Had a lot of folks on the call, it sounds like people think you're just pulling out a deferred to make these numbers. How much of this is just satisfying backlog? How much of it is also shared in? What's going on in terms of driving the demand? Ita Brennan : I don't think that I -- are actually up $110 million in our guidance for the first half, right? So I don't think anybody thinks we're using deferred to drive the numbers, right? Jayshree Ullal : It's organic demand, absolutely. We have backlog. We don't talk about that. And we have an increase in deferred, all 3 or 2. We just have to ship. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess if I can just ask you 2 quick ones on the enterprise vertical here. Jayshree, you mentioned the strong momentum you have with enterprise customers. I mean, one of the concerns we've been hearing from investors is about the current macro and how enterprises respond to that in terms of any weakness in the order trends. Maybe if you can clarify if you are seeing any of that in your discussions with these customers? And also if you can give us an update on the campus revenue, which you were looking to double. Sounds from the momentum that you should be sort of on track to better, relative to your expectations. But if you can just give us an update there? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Samik. We are seeing no change in the enterprise momentum. It's strong. We haven't seen any slowdown, maybe it will later on. You have the impact of inflation trends, who knows? But at the moment, things are looking very strong. Chris Smith, Ashwin and the whole team are just knocking at the door always for products. They're certainly creating the demand with their customers.  And as for the campus, a very similar story. Our goal is to double this year, and we've only had 1 quarter, but 1 quarter doesn't make a trend, but this 1 quarter alone is showing a trend in that direction. And as I think you asked me on Analyst Day, I shared with you that we will grow at least to 750 million by 2025. I think we can achieve that perhaps if we are in a less constrained environment, we could beat it, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Unidentified Analyst : Pierre is in a noisy environment. So this is Antoine asking one on behalf of Pierre\u2019s questions. So could you please share your thoughts on NVIDIA's Spectrum 4? How you see this shift sitting in the competitive landscape? And how you're seeing VCR possibly becoming a competitor? And maybe when do you expect to have 51.2 terabits per second chips in your products? Jayshree Ullal : Well, we've always viewed NVIDIA as a partner, especially for the DPUs and NICs, when they were Mellanox, and we continue to view that. There are times when companies choose a vertical stack. And I think NVIDIA's focus on Spectrum 4 is more as a vertical stack for their captive customer opportunities. As a horizontal best-of-breed, we don't see them as a competitor at all. And Arista is poised to be best of breed and continues to be the preferred choice with customers. Anshul, you want to add to the 51 terabit road map? Anshul Sadana : So Pierre, let me just remind you that the 25.60 is just now ramping. So we're very happy with that. And core development projects we take on with our customers are well along as well. But 51 is really next gen. It's at least 2 years out, maybe more for many of the high-volume customers. And the announcement gain doesn't really matter, right? Just because someone announced doesn't mean others are not working on the chip either. We will be ready in time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : A lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go back to kind of some of the architectural stuff that you've talked about, Jayshree, in the past. AI Fabric, you continue to bring this up on conference calls these last couple of quarters. We're seeing obviously some big large deployments at one of your large Cloud Titan customers. I'm just curious if you can offer up any other thoughts around the size of this incremental opportunity, the trajectory of what you're seeing? If you're seeing it become more broader based? Just any context around that opportunity for Arista. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Aaron, I bring it up more because I think it's a strategic innovation much like Arista pioneered cloud networking with the leaf-spine architecture, and when it came to the forefront with a front-end network that was based on that architecture. What we see here is that the back-end network is changing, and that this seems to primarily be interconnect bus-based InfiniBand-based and high-performance clusters, HBC as it's often called. But the new AI workloads really are data and compute-intensive, and they can't be bus or IO-based alone or just focus on latency. They are pushing -- we're pushing the envelope of Ethernet to really deal with the predictable latency, the ability to scale a whole network, et cetera. Very much in the first innings. So you're right to say it's starting with the early deployment of cloud customers, much like cloud itself started 5 years ago. But I think it's going to penetrate some of the specialty clouds and workloads and large enterprises as well. But this will emerge and take place over the next 3 to 5 years. It's not going to happen overnight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Tal Liani : I'm going to follow the tradition of one clarification and one question. The clarification. On one hand, you say supply chain is getting worse. On the other hand, you're getting -- you're giving a very strong guidance for next quarter. So how do you reconcile the fact that it's getting worse and the guidance is so strong? And the second question is one of the top questions I'm getting from investors is that we know that Microsoft and Facebook are strong. We know that they're investing a lot in their data centers right now. And the question is how much exposure, how much dependency you have on this perhaps concentration -- customer concentration, vertical concentration? Any data you can give on that front? Jayshree Ullal : Right. So supply chain is getting worse because of the extended lead times, not just because of that because we were planning for that, but because of the sudden surprising decommit. So when they're trying to build a product and ship it out and suddenly we don't have these last 2 components, it just freezes the whole supply chain and our ability to commit to revenue. So as Ita said, what do you do at that point? John and the team had to go scarring the face of the earth to get parts that would normally cost x that are now 100x in many cases. And that's a very stressful thing because sometimes, you get them and sometimes, we don't. So our ability in Q1 to shift more was very much there, but a constraint in Q1 to ship more was also problematic because we couldn't get the parts. And that is the story for Q2 and perhaps will go into Q3 as well. Now how does that affect us? We may be executing better than others, but it's affecting us in that because of the elevated cost of these components and expedite, it's showing up as gross margin. So we have a gross margin pressure for the next couple of quarters, both due to the cloud mix, which was your second question, and the commitments from Microsoft and Meta and other cloud titans as well as these expedites that are adding double pressure on our gross margin. So that's what we wanted to take away. We're going to execute as best as we can. Customers come first. We're going to do our best there, even if it means buying these components at very, very elevated costs. Do you want to answer the cloud question and especially with Microsoft and Meta, Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Well, these are 2 great customers to have, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We don't control the market, right? These are some of the largest cloud companies in the world, and we are the leader in cloud networking. So yes, we are exposed to them, but these investments are highly leveraged, whether it's product development, whether it's developing the road map, whether it's getting economies of scale on our product line and manufacturing, there's several benefits we get, and the customers get those benefits as well. So as a result of that, we are happy that these customers are doing well and growing and just increasing the CapEx and we benefit from that as well. Jayshree mentioned that -- either the last earnings call or earlier, both of them are expected to be 10% customers this year. And we are happy with that outcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Congratulations, Jayshree, either to your teams and Anshul. I have one question, and that is about the lag time between your pricing actions and the orders. So Ita mentioned a few times about the December price increases. But I just wanted to see, wouldn't it be logical that all customers are putting in a lot more orders now to give you more visibility? Because selfishly and rightfully and smartfully and economically, it would be better pricing knowing that prices are going to go up in the future? Or Ita and Jayshree, you're saying that you've adjusted prices since that December price increase? I just wanted to get some color on the lagged pricing orders. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Jim, thank you for the congratulations and wishes. So we made a pricing increase that we spoke to you about in November. The effectiveness of the pricing is very difficult to control right away. So first of all, we give them some notice. So historically, we have. And so orders in flight don't get affected by the pricing. Orders and backlog also don't get affected by the pricing.  So all said and done, even though we're getting new orders with the new pricing, everything that's shipping in Q1, Q2, Q3 and a good chunk of Q4 will have the old pricing. That's what we're trying to say. Orders we're getting now will reflect the new pricing, and that will come in late Q4 or 2023. We are contemplating a second price increase given the tremendous pressure we have on costs. And -- but again, once again, if we make it now, its effect is not going. Does that help you answer the question? Jim Suva : It does. And my point is, compared to November, things have really changed. It's been 6, 7 months since now. So I guess it sounds like you're kind of contemplating, but I just was wondering if it was more dynamic since last November with your pricing. Jim Suva : Yes. No, we've been very thoughtful about not shaking up pricing over and over again. Some of our competitors have done it 5 times. We've pretty much only done it once, but we are contemplating a second one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Q \u2013 Ben Bollin : Jayshree and Ita, I was hoping you could touch on your thoughts around the durability of the orders that you're seeing right now? Jayshree, you commented a little bit on hyperscale. But any thoughts around how far in advance you're seeing orders from cloud titan and enterprise customers? And then also, I'd be interested in your thoughts on the type of financial commitments you're seeing from the different verticals and how you're monitoring and managing with risk or perceived risk of excessive bookings or pull forward? That's it. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So you're asking about durability of our orders and authenticity of our orders, if I understood it correctly, right? Q \u2013 Ben Bollin : That is correct. Jayshree Ullal : First of all, because we don't -- we fulfill through channels, but so much of our orders are very intimate relationships with our customers, to answer your second question first. We really believe the orders are not double booked or double ordered, there may be some. But majority of our cloud orders, enterprise, cloud provider, service providers, these are relationships, dialogue conversations we have regularly. So we have no reason to believe at this point that there's double booking going on of any kind. There could be a minor percentage, but nothing major. In terms of durability, again, our customers are planning for a 1- to 2-year horizon. So I believe the durability of our orders in this 1- to 2-year horizon is strong. Of course, there's always a risk that the orders are cancelable and they may make changes. But for most part, they've stayed committed to us, and we have seen them be consistent in wanting to get our product and willing to wait for it. So durability and authenticity is good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik Suppiger : One, just what are you telling your customers in terms of lead times for your longer lead time products? And how do -- what are your customers telling you in terms of how that compares to some of your competitors in terms of their lead times? And then Ita, could you just comment, the 200 to 300 basis point impact, presumably that's Q2 and Q3. Do you think that starts to dissipate after Q3? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, look, it's tough, right? I think we're probably with that at least Q2, Q3, and then we should start getting some relief from the pricing and other things in Q4. But I think I'd hold that through Q2 and Q3. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And on lead times, it really varies by product and it varries by decommits right now. So we thought we were doing super well, and we were \u2013 I was king of the jungle and on top of the line if you asked us this last November. But I think things have degraded for all our peers and for us. So lead are definitely measured in many weeks and many months. Erik Suppiger : Do you strive to have shorter lead times than your competitors? Jayshree Ullal : We strive to execute better, and I think we have done better than our competitors, and we hope we continue to do so. What we don't do is promise one lead time and then come up with another, at least not intentionally. Erik Suppiger : Let me ask this, do your competitor -- do you have customers leaving your competitors for you noting that your lead times are shorter? Jayshree Ullal : They do try. I have had a number of enterprise customers come to us and say, \"I got all of this I can give to you if you can ship now.\" But again, we're not able to ship now either. So much as they try, the best we can do is face some kind of use cases for them in different products. But it isn't the case of direct substitution. It's a case of switching from one vendor to another and still having a plan across a period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I guess I had another question on purchase commitments. The $4.3 billion is a big number, an impressive number. And certainly, in this environment, it's very understandable. I guess if I play the other side of this, how do you see the risk of getting caught with lots of high-cost componentry in the case where the supply chain ultimately corrects and prices normalize? Is that something you guys think about? Is it a risk in your mind? Or just simply worth it in terms of having more opportunity to gain share right now? Jayshree Ullal : I think it's simply worth it, George. I've seen a few of these in my career. And the first thing you do here is you really procure your newest products, your components that are least likely to get obsolete. And I think we've been very smart and sensible about it. Second thing is don't confuse purchase commitments with purchase arrivals. They've not arrived yet. They're going to take multiple quarters or years to arrive. So think of this as a multiyear purchase commitment that could arrive in '22, '23 or, in some cases, '24. And the third thing is we look at this as a wise investment for a lot of common components that will be in our new products as well. So all in all, no regrets. There may be some perturbation on some components that arrive and don't arrive, but we feel good about this being one of our best investments for the short and long term. George Notter : Got it. And is there any safety valve or net for you guys in terms of the ability to push out those deliveries or cancel orders? How do you think about that? Jayshree Ullal : Regarding pushout, we'd rather they don't. We don't want that safety valve at the moment. So most of the orders in the semiconductor industry, if you have been working around them, are generally noncancelable, but they can be managed from a time basis point of view. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Thanks for squeezing me in here given most of questions have been answered, most of mine are just follow-ups. I wanted to actually circle back to Suva's question on pricing, not so much on the magnitude of the price side, but what are you seeing with customers across the verticals of what you're implementing that can give confidence that you're not getting a pull-in of orders of potentially more pass-through being needed, as these are smart buyers that can see the supply chain is likely getting worse, if you're seeing it too. And then additionally, why not implement noncancelable terms like others in the space have? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I think they are both good questions, James. I'll take the first one. Noncancelable orders are easier said than done because they're based on contractual terms. So where we can do it, we will look at that. But generally speaking, we have long-term contracts. And in terms of -- what was the other question? Ita Brennan : Pricing. Jayshree Ullal : Right. Pricing and one, the impact of pricing? Or what was the question again? James Fish : Yes. It was more on not necessarily the actual pricing itself. We all kind of have heard it and know it, but it's more about what gives you confidence that we're not getting a pull-in of orders as it presents you guys taking the second step up. I mean -- Jayshree Ullal : I think, yes. James, I think the key word is not pull in, but better planning. So they are obviously looking at their purchases. When the lead times are 6 weeks, they could look at this year, this year and not worry about next year. So -- but now they're having to consider their budgets and their plans for not only this year, but next year. So I -- so definitely, I think you're seeing the demand of not just this year, but as Anshul often likes to say, this year has an extra quarter, maybe 2. So from that point of view, I think they are planning longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Tom Blakey : My question is about software. So everybody can hang up, and I'll just ask you guys this question. The Business -- this business line saw a slowing of growth to 15% growth from 30-plus percent last quarter, strong quarter. It could just be timing. But I'd love to just take the opportunity to dive a little bit deeper in terms of what percentage of this line, it's important line in my mind, a subscription and ratable software represent 4 percentage services. Maybe just take the opportunity to dive a little bit deeper in terms of what the largest software solution, what\u2019s the largest percentage of software solutions are? Jayshree Ullal : Tom, it's definitely work in progress. We could do better here. I would classify our software in sort of 3 buckets. The perpetual licenses that are very important that go with our products, and we continue to be strong there. These could be routing licenses, automation licenses, analytics, et cetera. Then as you call them, the subscription revenue. And as I've often alluded to, we don't just take our business and make it subscription. These are generally new businesses, like DANZ Monitoring Fabric, observability, the AVA sensors for threat hunting, CloudVision for network-as-a-service. And they're doing well, but the revenue trails the bookings, as you know. They're multiyear subscriptions. And this is still small for us. And so these 2 buckets together can be viewed as something that's in the 10% range that we would like to double in the next few years, right? And then there's the services bucket. When you do really well on product, the service percentages that you saw this year -- this quarter can get smaller. Q4 tends to be our strongest services and renewals bucket, and that tends to be typically in the mid-teens to sometimes high teens. So these 3 are really our recurring and software components, and they're very important, but they tend to dwarf when your product is terribly strong like it is this year. Tom Blakey : That's very helpful. And just one last quick one to squeeze in. The deferred revenue delays that Ita referred to, you commented about new products causing delays here. This has happened in the past, and this is a big uptick. Was there -- I thought I heard you say it was a new cloud customer. There's not many in cloud titans. Was that accurate? Did I hear that right? Ita Brennan : No. So not in the cloud. It's really the -- it's pretty much the existing customers, new use cases, new products. And then on the enterprise side, because there is some enterprise stuff in there, too, it's new customers where we're deploying for the first half time. Liz Stine : We have time for 1 last question. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence. Woo Jin Ho : Just a clarification on the second half outlook. Is that dependent on the supply chain getting a little bit better from where it is right now? Or does that assume that there's no changes to the de-commit environment? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think, look, we're going to take this quarter by quarter here. I think our reference to the full year, et cetera, is assuming a continued constrained environment. I don't think we think the world changes that much, right? But we'll take it quarter-by-quarter. Liz Stine : Thank you, again. This concludes the Arista Networks First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website.

We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We delivered revenues of $1.05 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.08. Service and support renewals contributed approximately 17.6% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 61.9%, was influenced by escalating costs due to supply chain as well as a higher cloud titan mix. We do expect both these trends to continue throughout 2022. In terms of Q2 2022 verticals, cloud titans was our largest vertical, followed by the enterprise, cloud specialty providers and financials tied for third position, with the service providers in fourth place. International contribution was 20% with the Americas at 80%, and strong performance particularly with our large cloud customers. In the first half of 2022, we completed two small acquisitions to bolster our investments in security and switching fabrics. We acquired Untangle, Inc. a security asset for edge threat management for our commercial branch offerings, led by former CEO, Scott Devens. In late Q2, we closed the acquisition of Pluribus Networks, led by former CEO, Kumar Srikantan. Pluribus pioneered a new class of unified cloud fabric networking endorsed by our partners, Ericsson for telco and 5G cloud, and NVIDIA for DPU-based networking. Our Q2 2022 results reinforce Arista\u2019s customer relevance in cloud titan, specialty cloud providers and mainstream enterprises. As I mentioned previously, our million-dollar logos have doubled in the last 3 years in all categories, greater than 1 million, greater than 5 million, greater than 10 million and significantly greater than 25 million customers. I would like to invite Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Cloud Expert, to shed some light on the nature of our strategic partnerships with cloud titan, that contribute at least hundreds of millions annually. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. We are proud to be a pioneer and market leader in cloud networking and have provided data center solutions to many cloud providers connecting millions of servers. The same platforms, [U.S.] (ph) software and network designs at a lower scale have also helped us win in all our other verticals, giving us an efficient model to grow our business. As we disclosed in previous calls, Microsoft and Meta are very special customers and expected to each be over 10% of our revenue for the full year. At Microsoft, we are deployed in all layers of their network, from the leaf switches at the top of rack to data center spine and regional spine to WAN and cloud edge layers across the globe. We have partnered together to create the DCI layer with encryption and long-reach pluggable optics, which has now become a gold standard in the industry. Microsoft deploys our products, both with SONiC and EOS, and the engineering partnership to codevelop the next-gen network is stronger than ever. Our newer 400-gig products are deployed in production, and we continue to receive very positive feedback about our quality and execution and continue to be the preferred supplier for Azure. We have also had a strong partnership with Meta and have been involved with their network design since the early days. We have codeveloped multiple generations of products with them, including the latest 25.6-terabit 7388 platform with unmatched power efficiency and time-to-market advantages. We have deployed in their colorful cluster fabrics with parallel planes. We\u2019ve also deployed in several use cases, including Meta\u2019s backbone layers, where there is a constant need for higher-speed networks. In addition to our top two titans, we are continuing to do well with the other titans as well, as well as cloud specialty providers, very similar partnerships to the big titans and use cases but at a smaller scale. We continue to have a great engineering partnership with customers when it comes to next-gen architectures, platforms or features. Over the last 2 years, we have also had a very strong partnership on supply chain. Customers who build their own servers know these challenges firsthand. The relentless work by the Arista manufacturing team to find additional supply despite so many lockdowns, looking at components in the broker market, analyzing second-order risk, and our forward-looking investments through purchase commitments are deeply appreciated by our customers. We are now recognized not only for our best-in-class products, but also for a superior supply chain compared to other alternatives. While we cannot predict the future and spend patterns on behalf of these guidance, our cloud business continues to be healthy. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. You can see that we are having one of our best years to date with our cloud customers. In terms of new products, Arista has introduced several this quarter. The 7130 Series is a powerful combination of low latency and a programmable EOS functionality designed for demanding high-frequency trading and exchange applications. Two 7130 models integrate fully featured L2/L3 switching with high-performance ultra-low latency L1 connectivity. Arista also launched its first commercial and distributed enterprise edge portfolio, the Cognitive Unified Edge, or CUE for short. CUE is an extension of our CloudVision to offer Edge-as-a-Service for commercial and distributed enterprises. Arista earned its highest net promoter score, NPS, of 80 in 2022 for customer support, translating to a world-class rating of 93%. Having an always available team with strong expertise, root cause analysis and fewer vulnerabilities, were cited as the primary reason for customers choosing Arista in this third-party independent report. Let me illustrate a few enterprise customer wins in the first half of 2022 to give you an idea. Firstly, a campus win for cognitive WiFi was an integral part of an RFP decision, changing the way wired and wireless is delivered to student dormitories in one of the largest universities in the U.S. Cognitive Unified Edge, or CUE, with rich dashboards for quality experience, client journey, security influenced that decision, beating out well-entrenched WiFi players. In a large international bank, we won the overall data center architecture, including spine with Layer 3 and EVPN. CloudVision was a key decision factor in enabling the customer to manage all their data sets and change control across cloud domains with superior automation and visibility. Our professional services and leading NPS score drove the next win, an enterprise customer providing supply chain management and manufacturing. Their heavy interest in routing on the premise and Azure for the public cloud was made possible with Arista\u2019s rich visibility and telemetry. Our major messaging platform supporting over 100 million users internationally was a strategic multimillion dollar win for Arista, including a combination of BGP peering and routing across the leaf and spine. Key reasons for this win included high port density, deep packet buffers for the edge as well as routing and EOS programmability to integrate with their homegrown automation. Another international win was in the IT banking outsourcing sector with a data center interconnect use case. It was once again possible with Arista\u2019s architectural advantages for telemetry and day 0 automation as well as assurance capabilities. Our reseller played a key role with Arista, where we were positively viewed as a single team by the customer. Last but by no means least with a global specialty cloud provider headquartered here in the Bay Area, California. Arista\u2019s flagship data center with our 3 spine platforms delivered tight performance and rich EOS quality and features such as flow spec, traffic class filtering and partnering for analysis and mitigation. With the collapse of the perimeter, Arista also won the security and visibility forensics layer, combining DMF, DANZ Monitoring Fabric, and NDR, network detection and response, into a holistic platform. As you can see, a common theme across all these wins is Arista\u2019s strength and proof-of-concept lab, best practice network design and deployment to the CloudVision and EOS being compelling differentiators. In summary, I am so proud of the Arista team as we have evolved from Arista as a startup at zero revenue way back in 2008 to a few hundred million dollars at IPO in 2014 to our first $1 billion a year in 2016, and now our first $1 billion quarter in Q2 2022. This has been a huge feat, a lot of hard work. And much credit and kudos and gratitude goes out to all my Aristans as well as our unwavering customers who have believed in us, continue to push us to build better cloud networking. Arista is not only the best of breed in cloud data centers today, but really centering multimodal data all the way from the client to the cloud based on our network data lake and AVA architecture. Our quest for proactive, predictive and prescriptive data-driven networking marches on. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Ita for financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This announcement of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 \u201822 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $1.052 billion, up 48.7% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance range of $950 million to $1 billion. Overall, demand in the quarter was healthy with strength across all areas of the business. The supply environment remains challenging with ongoing supplier decommits constraining shipments and requiring higher cost broker purchases and expedite fees. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 17.6% of revenue in the second quarter, down from 19.2% in Q1. This largely reflected accelerated growth in product revenues, while services and software continue to grow on a more consistent basis. International revenues for the quarter came in at $206.8 million or 20% of total revenue, down from 24% in the first quarter. This reflected strength in U.S. revenues in the period, particularly with our larger cloud titan customers. Overall gross margins in Q2 were 61.9% at the upper end of our guidance range of 60% to 62% with somewhat lower-than-expected expedite fees in the period. As previously discussed, the current lower gross margin ranges reflect a healthy cloud mix and the need for higher levels of broker component sourcing and expedite fees. Operating expenses for the period were mostly flat to last quarter at $226.1 million or 21.5% of revenue. R&D spending came in at $148 million or 14.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at $144.3 million. This primarily reflected increased headcount costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense were $63.1 million or 6% of revenue compared to $66.2 million last quarter, with increased headcount offset by lower variable expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $15 million or 1.4% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $425.5 million or 40.4% of our revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $4.6 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 20.9%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $342.7 million or 32.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 316.58 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.08, up approximately 59% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.9 billion. We repurchased $483.7 million of our common stock during the second quarter at an average price of $101 per share. As a reminder, we\u2019ve now repurchased approximately $693 million or 6.5 million shares against our October 2021 billion dollar board authorization. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. We also completed two acquisitions in the first half with a total consideration of $158.9 million, including $4 million in common stock and the remainder in cash. The revenue and expenses associated with these acquisitions are included in our outlook provided below and are not expected to have a material impact on our financials in the near term. Now turning to operating cash performance for the second quarter. We generated $101.1 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting strong earnings performance, somewhat offset by increased working capital investments. Increases in inventory and other assets are mainly driven by a receipt of components for future shipments, including shipments delayed due to supplier decommits. This trend should reverse once overall supply conditions for these decommitted components improve. DSOs came in at 51 days, down from 67 days in Q1, reflecting the linearity of billings and a decline in deferred revenue in the period. Inventory turns were 1.9x, up from 1.7x in the prior quarter. Inventory increased $852.8 million in the quarter, up from $694.2 million in the prior period, reflecting higher component and peripherals inventory and a small increase in switch-related finished goods. Our purchase commitment number for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion in Q1. These multiyear purchase commitments reflect overall strength in demand and the current long lead time supply environment. As a reminder, we continue to prioritize newer early life cycle products for inclusion in these strategies in order to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1 billion, down from $1.1 billion in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which may vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $228 million of the balance, down from $327 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue largely related to customer-specific acceptance clauses for new products with our larger customers. Accounts payable days were 63 days, up from 58 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.9 million. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. Our Analyst Day outlook for 2022 call for 30% year-over-year revenue growth, somewhat balanced across our market sectors and heavily constrained by supply. Reflecting on the first half of the year, we achieved revenue growth of approximately 40% in the face of a very difficult supply environment. We had, again, saw the resilience of the business model with higher component costs, combined with a heavier cloud mix, lowering gross margin but allowing for increased scale, operating margin expansion and year-over-year earnings per share growth of approximately 48%. Looking to the third quarter. While demand metrics have remained strong across the business, attempts to predictably scale shipments have been somewhat hindered by ad hoc supplier decommits. Our Q3 outlook assumes some improvement in ship volume but reflects a balanced view of the remaining supply chain uncertainties. We expect gross margin pressure to continue with some need for broker purchases and expedite fees, combined with a healthy revenue contribution from our cloud titan customers. As to spending and investments, we expect to continue to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing, in line with our baseline investment plan. However, we are cognizant of the broader macro risks, and we will continue to monitor spending carefully. So all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items, is as follows : Revenues of approximately $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion, gross margin of approximately 60% to 62%, operating margin of approximately 39%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% and diluted shares on a post-split basis of approximately 316 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter. I just \u2013 Ita, I\u2019d like to go through the outlook commentary that you provided. Appreciating that you gave the 3Q guide. I guess I was a little bit confused or maybe I just missed it. Are you \u2013 what is the updated kind of expectation for the full year? Because as we look at it, obviously, 30% growth would imply some form of pretty sharp deceleration in the fiscal \u2013 or in the calendar fourth quarter. So just curious if you could update us how you\u2019re thinking about that 30% that you laid out at the Analyst Day, obviously, for the implied 4Q guide. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean obviously, we\u2019re pretty happy that we\u2019ve done very well against that original metric for the year. I mean we\u2019re pretty much at 40% for the first three quarters. We\u2019re not guiding the fourth quarter specifically, just given some of the uncertainty around supply, etcetera. But I think we feel pretty good about where we sit now versus that original growth rate. Jayshree Ullal : Aaron, this is Jayshree. There is a lot that we have taken as a team, Anshul, Ita and myself, is one quarter at a time when we get so many surprises on supply chain. There is no point getting ahead of ourselves. But we certainly feel good that the demand and our commitment and execution has gone well, well, well north of the 30% we guided in 30% \u2013 in November last year, but one quarter at a time is still our philosophy. Aaron Rakers : Okay, thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is now open. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. So maybe just want to follow-up on supply chain and vendor decommits. I know there were some headwinds last quarter, and it sounds like you have more this quarter. But one of your competitors really struggled, I think, securing components. Obviously, they paid higher expedited fees and revenue growth was strong, but it sounds like that they took a bigger hit. Just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you\u2019re seeing in that market, whether it\u2019s in the broker market for the components or the expedited freight fees. Just a little bit more color. And how do you think that plays out the balance of the year? I know you talked about having some limited visibility. But is there an expectation that as we maybe move into next year, we could see some relief, and that gross margins could get a little bit healthier as we move into \u201823? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So David, I think, as you know from our strategy, we have left no stone unturned in supply purchase commitments. They just keep going higher and higher. This quarter, we reported $4.5 billion. So there is no lack of desire in Arista\u2019s part to fulfill the demand we have. We are clearly going in with strong demand, strong backlog, etcetera. However, we need all the components to come together, and the component problem continues. It has been bad in Q1. It\u2019s no better in Q2, and we\u2019re not foreseeing it much \u2013 with much improvement in Q3. So perhaps in 2023, we will get some relief. But again, to get relief, we have to have all the components come. If we\u2019re missing one component, we can\u2019t build a system. So our guide reflects that and our behavior in how we acquire components is reflecting that. We\u2019re still not getting the components. Many of the components have 70-week lead times, and therefore, we have to plan multiple quarters and years for that. David Vogt : Just a quick follow-up, Jayshree. So the $4.5 billion of purchase order commitments, I know it\u2019s multiple years, but how do you \u2013 maybe can you help us think about how that sort of falls through the balance of this year into \u201823 and beyond from a product revenue perspective? If you could help us kind of frame that. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. If we could do that, we probably wouldn\u2019t buy so much. We don\u2019t know. We know it\u2019s a multiyear commitment, and it comes when our suppliers deliver it to us. So in most cases, we\u2019re just not getting enough supply, and we\u2019re getting very small percentages of what we ask. David Vogt : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. And congratulations to your entire team for such great work in a very challenging supply chain environment. I wanted to focus my question on the demand side. It sounds like Ita and Jayshree both mentioned that the demand has gone well north of 30%. But you\u2019re not updating the full year and taking it one quarter at a time. That makes sense. But the question I have is more about kind of the backlog and visibility that you\u2019re getting. I only assume backlog continued to increase. But we recently saw some news of some of the cloud titans changing their depreciation schedules for the switch and network components. So I\u2019m wondering how you think about that. And are you getting more visibility than, say, even 6 months ago given the supply chain issues? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, Jim. Thank you for the good wishes. And I couldn\u2019t agree with you more. I\u2019m very proud of the Arista team for this major milestone this quarter and beyond. So I remember a time when we talked about cloud titans [Indiscernible] would it be flat or single digits? It\u2019s a very proud moment to say Anshul and the team have been consistently growing the entire five verticals but especially the cloud titans significantly. So all the growth and upside you\u2019re seeing north of 30% is a direct contribution to the healthiness of our cloud customers, especially the cloud titans. So first, I want to say that. Secondly, we don\u2019t report orders. We don\u2019t report backlog. We\u2019re very disciplined about that. They kind of are meaningless numbers unless we can execute. Our visibility has improved with the cloud titans. I\u2019m going to turn it over to you. They have gone from 6 months, Anshul, to about a year. How are you feeling about that? Anshul Sadana : Right. Well, the cloud customers are as anxious as everyone else to get through these supply constraints so that they can come back to normal planning. But for the time being, they understand the issues. And as I highlighted, they not only partner with us on product, they actually go deeper in understanding what the constraints are, which component is short and so on. So the visibility is roughly a year. 52 weeks is our current lead time with them. But in the near-term, that demand is healthy. We can\u2019t really predict what happens beyond that. A lot of people are trying to guess \u2013 are asking us on their behalf. I think it\u2019s best to ask these big companies directly. But we feel good about their business and the build-outs. They are in a healthy cycle. As you all know, they are doing the 400-gig upgrade or investment in the DCI layers and several other refreshes inside the data center as well. So, all that is coming along well. Ita Brennan : And then just back to the depreciation question, Jim. I mean I think when you think about accounting and how that works, I mean that usually follows what\u2019s already been happening kind of in the business. So I don\u2019t think there is anything new there from an operations perspective. It\u2019s just the accounting kind of catching up to what\u2019s happening in the field. And we saw something similar a couple of years ago, where they also kind of elongated the depreciation cycle. But we didn\u2019t see anything different in the operations of the business. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations to you and your teams. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, Jayshree, as we\u2019ve gone through this earnings season the last week or so, we\u2019ve seen some mixed feedback on how the enterprise vertical is responding to the current macro. Just wondering if you can sort of \u2013 I\u2019m not asking for orders or backlog from the enterprise vertical, but how are your conversations with enterprise customers progressing? Do you see the same intent in terms of spending from them going into the next year? And the response to \u2013 I know on the last earnings call, you talked about price increases. So how has the response been to those price increases in the enterprise vertical? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik. Well, nobody likes price increases, for sure. But I have to tell you, the customer credibility and connection we have has never been higher with both enterprise and cloud customers. I mean when you step back and look at this, in less than 5 years, we are now larger than many legacy stand-alone enterprise customers, right? So enterprise business has been growing faster than many of our competitors and peers. I feel good that we have a strong relationship with them. And despite all the talk of recession, while Arista is not a bellwether for a macro recession, I would certainly classify our quarter and much of this year as micro momentum and a little oasis both for enterprise and cloud in our execution. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back on the supply chain because it does seem based on your product deferred coming down by about $100 million. And Ita, we talked about roughly $50 million drawdown a quarter. It seemed like you were able to ship a little bit more and the expedited fees came down. Are you expecting this reversal of product deferred to continue somewhat at this rate? Because I think it was last quarter, we were talking about $50 million drawdown. And is there any way to help us bridge how backlog can feed into product deferred revenue, understanding it does still come down to execution, Jayshree? Ita Brennan : Yes. Jim, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to kind of discuss kind of the backlog of the bookings. This is kind of the worst possible time to do that with lead times where they are and etcetera. It\u2019s just not a helpful metric. Coming back to the deferred revenue, we did draw down $100 million in Q2. And the guide that we just gave you for Q3 assumes no drawdown, right? So just to be clear, there is no assumption of deferred revenue drawdown. So we are improving on the shipment side in Q3. So I think that\u2019s good news. We\u2019re pleased to see that. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it. James Fish : Thanks, Ita. Ita Brennan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. First off, I found in quarter 48% revenue growth. I looked at our model back to 2014, \u201815 time frame. And I think you\u2019ve only generated three quarters that are in that vicinity of 50%, which is pretty amazing since one of the last times you were up there was back when you were a $600 million annual company, much less the revenues you\u2019re producing now. So I guess my question is, as we look at that comp and think about the out year, and we listened to you say that you\u2019ve got a year\u2019s worth of lead time, is there any reason to believe that we should be tailoring down our expectations for \u201823 given your commentary at your Analyst Day would imply around a 15% growth rate in that time frame? Or should we be taking these extremely tough comps that you\u2019re generating this year against a supply-constrained environment and look at those as too daunting to grow at that rate against? And I know you don\u2019t like to go out, but you\u2019re kind of forced to think about it. Jayshree Ullal : You know us well, Alex. You know us well. Well, first of all, thank you for the discussion down history lane. It\u2019s always good to know when \u2013 how we grew at $600 million and how we\u2019re growing now off a base that\u2019s almost $3.9 billion or whatever it will be by the end of the year. I think the way to think of this is the following : We committed to double-digit growth, and we see no reason of our large base that we still couldn\u2019t grow double digits next year. We do think that the lead times will improve maybe in the back half of 2023. And as lead times improve, there will be some challenges, right? The challenges will come in terms of losing some of our visibility and as well as our demand. And then if there really is a recession, we will probably feel it too. But all said and done, we\u2019re still feeling good about 22%, and we\u2019re feeling good about the first half of \u201823. And we will tell you more at the next Analyst Day. Alex Henderson : That all I could ask for. Thank you so much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is now open. Liz Stine : Jason? Operator, we should go to the next question. Jason Ader : Hello. Can you hear me? Jayshree Ullal : We can hear you now. Jason Ader : Okay. Sorry. When we think about your enterprise seven and eight-figure accounts, is there any way to tell how penetrated you are in those accounts? Because I know in some cases, they may have another primary supplier, and they are using you for maybe part of their network or new data center or something. But just it would be helpful to know how much headroom you have in some of those large enterprises where you\u2019ve already penetrated to some extent. But just curious about how you think about that. Jayshree Ullal : Jason, that\u2019s an excellent question. I don\u2019t have a precise answer for you. But I think one of the verticals we have good penetration is the financials. We started out in the high-frequency trading. But even there, I\u2019d say we have a long way to go because we\u2019ve got the data center opportunity. We\u2019ve got the campus. And then if you look at the other verticals, we\u2019re only starting, right? Less than 5 years in our journey here. So \u2013 and as you know, enterprises have a long tail and take time. So I don\u2019t feel very penetrated in the enterprise. There is huge TAM and huge upside. And we\u2019re probably a little more penetrated in the financials of the data center but still nothing close to 50%. Jason Ader : And are you seeing those orders grow every year \u2013 I mean those accounts grow every year at a nice pace? Just to give us a sense of kind of the follow-on opportunity after you get that initial land? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, we definitely see land and expand. It doesn\u2019t always happen exactly every year. It depends on their spend, but it certainly happens over several quarters. Or sometimes, it skips a year and goes to the next year. Jason Ader : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Anshul, I had a question for you about your thoughts on how equipment availability is influencing the network redundancy in these large Cloud Titans. How is that evolving? And how are they playing catch-up to address some of the shortages they are seeing? Anshul Sadana : Okay. That\u2019s a good question. Generally, these customers are very resilient architectures with the leaf spine designs. So they could do short-term trade-offs if they absolutely had to. They try to avoid these because it\u2019s very hard to go back and retrofit a site. But if you are just completely out, then you\u2019d go with a lighter network initially, and then you add more over time. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening broadly. I saw some comments floating out as well, but that\u2019s a rare exception. Most customers are deploying the site at the scale they want to open. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line now open. Rod Hall : Yes. Thanks for the question. I guess I\u2019ll use the oasis analogy again, Jayshree. So you have this nice oasis. Are you taking water from somebody else\u2019s oasis? I\u2019m just curious whether you are using \u2013 able to supply in this environment. Even though I know it\u2019s tough for you, it seems like you\u2019ve done better than others. And I\u2019m wondering, do you feel like that\u2019s something you\u2019ve been able to use to gain a little bit of share maybe from some other competitors, particularly in enterprise. And I have a quick follow-up for you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Rod. I now feel like a camel. To continue your analogy, I think it\u2019s multiple efforts. As Anshul alluded to this, the manufacturing team and the supply chain has just done an outstanding job. The leadership of Anshul, John McCool, Susan Hayes, they have left no stone unturned. I can\u2019t speak to my peers in the industry, but I can just tell you that my team pushes themselves to keep doing better and they are an A team already. So, thank you for that. But coming back to also the relationship we have with our enterprise. When I look at what Chris Schmidt, Ashwin and the team are doing, we now have a far bigger relevance and seat at the table. It\u2019s an investment we only started a few years ago, 3 years to 4 years ago. And we feel like the enterprises are inviting us as much as we are going to them. And our product, our quality, our differentiation, our software-defined capabilities with CloudVision and EOS speak for themselves. So, it\u2019s a combination of becoming the gold standard even for not only cloud titans, but the enterprise, our manufacturing execution and then also the relationships we have built, albeit young, where it\u2019s less than 5 years old, we have got a long ways to go. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks for that Jayshree. And then I also wanted to ask, there has been a lot of speculation about the delay in Sapphire Rapids and maybe what effect that would have on major project builds, whether it might create some volatility in those builds or something like that. I am just curious if you could give us any color on that, what you think about, does it affect things at all? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, the last time we experienced this with Facebook, many of you may remember, it was a little more nightmarish scenario for us. They not only \u2013 because of delays, they skipped an entire server cycle, and Arista certainly felt it, that sneeze turned into pneumonia for us. But this time around, I think there are many more competitive options. And what we see, especially due to supply chain, is either the customer will inspect the assets or look for an alternative. Anshul, you are seeing some of this. You can shed some light. Anshul Sadana : Sure. Most of these cloud companies [Technical Difficulty] we are not seeing them wait or have any odd one effect. They will deploy either current technology or alternate technology, whatever they can get their hands on immediately. So, there is really no slowdown because of [Technical Difficulty] countries. Rod Hall : Great. Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. One, just Ita, would you imagine kind of any of kind of \u2013 I understand for Q3, you are not expecting a major deferred revenue drawdown. But just how you are thinking about it throughout the year? And then second question, just maybe on supply chain. I think some peers kind of within the space have maybe said within the last couple of weeks or maybe even the last month of the quarter, conditions may be improved slightly. Your guidance would imply that there is kind of some improvement happening. So, I just wanted to see kind of during the quarter, is there any volatility that we should be mindful of or any kind of signs as you exited the quarter that conditions are just improving slightly? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I think on the deferred, it\u2019s tough to kind of forecast it out into Q4, especially when we are not kind of being very specific on the overall quarter. I think it\u2019s a quarter at a time, we have seen some improvements in Q3. You can see that in the kind of underlying ship numbers. So, hopefully, that continues. But I don\u2019t think there is anything particular around deferred for Q4 at this point. Jayshree Ullal : And then in terms of the supply chain itself, we are seeing marginal improvements, but nothing to get terribly excited about. We need a whole lot more components than we are getting. So, not yet, Meta. Meta Marshall : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you had some thoughts as to the potential implications for Arista given a number of the cloud titans have talked about slowed hiring. I imagine it wouldn\u2019t have an immediate effect on you, but just wondering how you are thinking about the public comments as well as the speculation given those comments that they are hiring fewer engineers, slowing up their expenses, given the stresses they are facing, what, if anything, does that mean to Arista? Jayshree Ullal : Well, Simon, I think every company needs to exercise some amount of discipline on expense management. And it\u2019s probably one of the first times that the cloud titans and the cloud customers, in general, have had to. But however, we feel good about the CapEx. We feel Arista is a small, small percentage of their CapEx. And the slow hiring has no impact on the CapEx spend at this time in the near-term for Arista. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just one point of clarification. I think last quarter, you had said that your demand and visibility was the highest ever. It sounds as though that\u2019s certainly still the case. Can you confirm if that is? And then secondly, the cloud titans and the specialty providers are clearly just posting some very robust demand. Can you talk to any broad trends that are driving this? Is there maybe focus video, or is it \u2013 are there any particular broad trends that you think are driving demand across the group? Jayshree Ullal : So, Erik, just to quickly answer your question, I think the visibility and demand is as strong as we expressed in Q3. The same symptoms, same experience. And in terms of cloud, take it away, Anshul. Anshul Sadana : Erik, the cloud customers are still going very strong at their normal use cases when it comes to a standard compute or storage applications. Those are still very strong. They are [Technical Difficulty] are doing well, too. And the cloud edge is also doing very well apart from having some of [Technical Difficulty]. Erik Suppiger : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Lauren on for Amit. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just going back to the purchase commitments and thinking about them in terms of the sequential uptick being much \u2013 at a much slower pace than the March quarter. So, how should we think about it in terms of lead times that you guys saw over the last 90 days? Would this be kind of an improvement or are lead times holding steady? Ita Brennan : I think, Lauren, what we saw last quarter was just kind of the beginning of the year and setting up some purchase orders for 2023. So, it was just more of a step function than you would expect to see normally. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything else into that. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Paul Silverstein : I have multiple questions, but the good news is my first one is asking Anshul if he would be kind enough to sit closer to the mic. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. That\u2019s easy. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate that. Anshul Sadana : One question at a time. Paul Silverstein : I actually care what you have to say, Anshul. The question, If I recall, you exited 2021 with enterprise at $200 million, and you are targeting $400 million for 2022, if I remember the numbers. I assume you are tracking ahead of that through the first \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to guide, but I assume you are tracking ahead of that $400 million annualized run rate for the year from the first half of the year. That\u2019s one question. The other question is, everyone is obviously concerned with macro environment translating to weakness for you and everybody else. Are there any \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like it, but are there any signs that you have seen, any communications from enterprise or cloud customers, wherever, of impending macro weakness? And related to that, where is the greatest opportunity for most sides from here? Is it more of the same? Is it the new product areas that you are edging out into? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Anshul, you are near the mic. You want to answer? Anshul Sadana : Paul, in terms of \u2013 you had multiple questions. Jayshree Ullal : On macro, look, there are no signs right now. Not that we are a bellwether, but at the moment, we are being prudent about expenses. We are prioritizing our projects. But no customer has come to us and said specifically that we got a macro issue or a recession issue and they want to cancel projects. That may change when recessions come, I have been through a few of them. They happen fiercely and suddenly. But as of now, so far, so good. Anshul Sadana : Paul, on the \u2013 go ahead. Jayshree Ullal : Go ahead on the enterprise. Anshul Sadana : Yes. The enterprise customers are all telling us that things are steady. They all are cautious or worried and asking what others are doing. But we are not seeing any slowdown from customers yet. Paul Silverstein : And relative to that $400 million number? How you are tracking? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So, that\u2019s \u2013 this is where we were a little \u2013 you mean on the campus, right? That\u2019s not a\u2026 Paul Silverstein : Yes. I apologize. Campus enterprise, exactly. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Okay. So, we are still on track to close the year at $400 million. We feel good about the demand. We need to feel better about the shipments. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, I trust demand \u2013 so if you have the shipments, you would be able to deliver greater than $400 million. The only issue is having the capacity. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Like I said, we feel good about the demand. I don\u2019t feel as good right now about the shipments. I need more components \u2013 yes. Paul Silverstein : Got it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you for the question. My question is on visibility. So, we have had this conversation a couple of times, Jayshree and Anshul, about just the visibility that you are getting from your customers. And I think what created the most amount of turbulence in the tech sector in this last quarter was what all these hyperscalers were saying, what the Taiwanese/Chinese supply chains were saying and reporting regarding cancellations, slowdowns, accelerations, etcetera. But if I just ask you guys to eliminate all of that, at the end of the day, has your visibility been extended and improved with your key customers, or has it essentially remained the same or has it worsened? Just to kind of get an idea on where we are on the spectrum. Jayshree Ullal : I like multiple choice questions. It remained the same. And I think the day we see lead times decline, we expect visibility to decline as well, but we don\u2019t see that for a while. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Your line is now open. Pierre Ferragu : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I am dying to ask you about how much your plans are being to buy in 2023 or how much components you are going to get in the next few quarters. Maybe I will actually move to something different. You have announced this quarter the acquisition of two rather small operations, Untangle and Pluribus. And I was wondering what you could tell us about how significant these acquisitions are in terms of like the \u2013 maybe like an idea of the number of people or developers or the hundreds of thousands of lines of software that these teams have developed. And if you could tell us about what\u2019s like the product vision behind these acquisitions, what kind of features are you adding? And which markets \u2013 which of your segments you want to address with these technologies. And most importantly, what\u2019s your integration strategy? Is that like additional products you are going to add to your line? Probably, is it deep technology you are going to integrate into your core EOS software or any other platform? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Well, Pierre, first of all, thank you for the refreshing new question. I appreciate it. We did make two small acquisitions. I think, Ita, in total about 150 employees aggregate of \u2013 we will increase our headcount in addition to our normal organic investments by another 150. And as you probably know, it\u2019s not uncommon for Arista to make small acquisitions, starting back in the 2018 with Metamako and Mojo and then Big Switch Networks and Awake. We have tended to make acquisitions for technology and talent. But most of all, they got to fit our culture so that we can make them successful. And we are very proud of the fact that all the four we have done to-date, we can see the business and cultural and product integration results of that. So, Untangle and Pluribus are no different. Untangle will be tackling the commercial and distributed enterprise market, bringing us very low-end security and edge threat management that we can bring in with our unsecure our wired and wireless for the mid-market and the channel market. Pluribus is a great acquisition of talent and technology to bring this concept of a unified cloud fabric. As you know, Arista has been building lots and lots of forms of cloud networking. But in two instances, it would be really exciting to see a fabric integrating them. One is in the telco cloud and 5G case. So, we are really excited to forge a new relationship with Ericsson through our Pluribus acquisition. And also in the DPU case, the data processing unit, there are a lot of DPU companies. NVIDIA is the market leader, and I am really looking forward to working with Jensen and the team on that and bringing more capability, rich capabilities and overlays into the DPU fabric. So, they are both talent and technology acquisitions to further a larger system-wide goal on our products. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Pierre. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks a lot. Any \u2013 I know a quarter ago, there was some talk about raising pricing. Just wondering what you guys decided to do in that area. Any sense for magnitude, any sense for timing in terms of when that might show up in the model? Thanks a lot. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, George. Yes, we did make two pricing adjustments, one last November that probably the earliest we will see effect of is in late Q4. And we have made a second pricing adjustment in late Q2 in June that again will probably only affect us in 2023. So, we expect most of this pricing to help our gross margins and neutralize some of the high costs we have had in 2023. George Notter : Got it. Any sense of magnitude on the June price adjustment? Jayshree Ullal : They were different in different products. We did not do \u2013 the magnitude range from 5% to 10%, depending on product. I should say, zero to 10%, shouldn\u2019t I? Anshul Sadana : Yes. George, the second raise was only on selective products, not across the portfolio. George Notter : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : We had the high cost. We took some price decision. Liz Stine : Thanks George. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Tal Liani : Hey guys. Anshul, 400-gig, we didn\u2019t talk about it for a long time. Can you talk about the significance of it to potential significance of it to your revenues going forward? You used to say at the beginning that it\u2019s a small business case, then the message changed. How do you see 400-gig deployed? How significant it is? And where is it being deployed? What kind of market verticals? Jayshree Ullal : Absolutely, 400-gig is very strategic to us, along with 100 gig and in some cases, 200-gig as well. Just to give you a quick review backward, we grew from about 70 customers in 200-gig and 400-gig in 2020 to 300 in 2021. And you can expect us to grow to more in 2022. The cloud customers are obviously the fastest adopters of 200-gig and 400-gig, as Anshul would attest. But we are starting to see a lot of 100-gig, 400-gig combinations in the enterprise as well. A - Liz Stine This concludes \u2013 go ahead Tal. Tal Liani : Revenue-wise, how significant it is given it\u2019s smaller numbers but higher price? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. It\u2019s still early stages for that. It\u2019s stronger this year. This is the third year of 400-gig. I think they were mostly in trials in 2021. We started seeing production in 2022 in a significant way. We will give you more year-end \u2013 as the market share later \u2013 numbers come out at the end of \u201822. Tal Liani : Thank you. Liz Stine : This concludes the Arista Networks second quarter 2022 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30, 2022. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2022 fiscal year, longer term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing capacity, inventory purchases and inflationary pressures on our business, the potential impact of COVID-19, extended lead times, product innovations and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. We delivered record revenues of $1.17 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.25. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 16.3% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 51.2%, was pressured by escalated costs due to supply chain as well as a substantially higher cloud titan mix. We expect some of these trends to continue into 2023. Cloud titan was our largest vertical, followed by enterprise and then cloud specialty providers, financials and finally, service providers. International contribution was at 17%, with the Americas at 83%, once again reflecting stronger cloud customer influence. Our Q3 2022 results reinforce Arista\u2019s customer relevance in both cloud titan and specialty cloud providers. I would like to invite Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer and Cloud [indiscernible] to shed some light on this. Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. Our partnership with the cloud titans and specialty providers keeps getting stronger. While supply chain got most of the attention for the last 2 years, we have achieved several technical milestones with our customers during this period, taking our products from labs to pilot to high-volume deployments. We have successfully deployed in more use cases than before, including the lease mine cluster designs, data center white spines, data center interconnects, backbone, WAN and Edge. Our customers have a deep appreciation of our expertise and execution. The titans, starting with Microsoft and Meta are continuing with their 400-gig journey. They are using our latest fixed and debuffer modular 400-gig switches in these new deployments. We are continuing to expand our use cases with the other titans too. While they are relatively smaller, these partnerships are healthy and continuing to grow as well. The specialty cloud providers are continuing to grow too. They have very similarly spine designs, but with smaller clusters and they too have the same DCI and regional designs just fewer ports. We are in a competitive industry and our customers like some diversity. However, we are very well positioned to maintain and grow our share given our quality, execution and some partnerships. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Anshul. We are experiencing one of our best ever cloud titan growth and revenue this year since IPO. Therefore, we expect north of 45% contribution in 2022 from this category with a diversified product portfolio and use cases, as you heard from Anshul. Speaking of new products, Arista introduced the next phase of routing this quarter in Q3. Arista\u2019s cloud-grade routing platform, power extensible operating system, EOS and our network data lake, NetDL, is built on a consistent architectural foundation for multiple routing use cases, such as peering, content delivery, networks, Cloud Connect, Enterprise Edge, mobile and Metro Edge as well as carrier core. We have successfully transformed legacy routers to modern routing. For our customers securing data in transit, Arista\u2019s innovative TunnelSec technology provides inline encryption and wire speed from 10-gig all the way up to 400-gig, eliminating the performance bottleneck of traditional encryption. Arista\u2019s latest R3 series routing portfolio continues to deliver for our adjacent market sector that we began 6 years ago. As I mentioned previously, our customer momentum continues. Our $1 million logos have doubled in the last 3 years and Arista\u2019s market share in 100, 200 and 400-gig ports climbs placing us at a number market leader position according to many industry analysts. Let me illustrate with a few customer wins this year. The recurring theme to remember is that Arista is diversifying its business with many use cases such as data center, campus, routing, cloud and edge based all on cloud principles. Our first enterprise win highlights the ever growing strength of a single solution for diverse use cases, in the data center, in the campus and in data center interconnect routing. Based on industry standards and monitoring capabilities with Arista\u2019s DANZ Monitoring Fabric, or DMF, Arista was uniquely positioned to provide a single EOS binary code version using CloudVision and our NetDL stack. The next is an international Americas win in the financial sector, providing secure data center solutions. Arista\u2019s competitive advantage was twofold. First, our single U.S. stack provided reassurance that they could handle security patches, bug patches, new software code upgrades with zero dime time, much better than our peers in the industry. Also, we can do much better automation. Traditionally, it used to take customers several months, if not years, to go live with a single data center with their incumbent vendor. Arista\u2019s programmatic APIs, continuous integration validation with DevOps integration was deployed across multiple data centers within just a few days with no human intervention or errors offering the lowest total cost of ownership. Our third win demonstrates our strength in campus in the healthcare sector. This customer was looking to upgrade its legacy infrastructure in multiple hospital locations and moving more to a cloud-operated model. Arista provided that cloud-managed network offering across the data center campus and cognitive WiFi and also WAN Edge and Internet Edge. The single pane of glass offers real-time network-as-a-service with visibility, health checks, troubleshooting and provisioning to the client, all the way to campus and to the cloud infrastructure. The next international win shows our continuing presence in the public sector. This customer wanted to move to a 100-gigabit Ethernet using Arista\u2019s Spine and Spline platforms to connect into incumbent DWDM, Edge and load balances for massive route scale. Arista\u2019s advantage was the lowest software security vulnerabilities over a 9-year period compared to alternatives that were significantly higher. This, by the way, also applied to Arista\u2019s cognitive WiFi with zero vulnerabilities. Our final win emphasizes Arista\u2019s ability to provide encryption as a part of a secure routing solution. This was an international Tier 2 service provider, whereby Arista delivered full line rate data in transit for the customers\u2019 remote sites. This bespoke design encompasses Layer 3 virtual private network, VPN, over VXLAN routing solutions with macro segmentation based on access less and direct flow rules, all managed by CloudVision. Overall, you could see that Arista continues to gain customer relevance and market share and building our vision for a client to cloud network. The promise of not only delivering on superior technology, but the ability to help our customers realize the operational benefits via world class quality, support, service is a real compelling advantage. We look forward to sharing more of our vision and strategy at our Analyst Day this Thursday, November 3, 2022. Now, I will turn over to Ita for our financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2022 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $1.177 billion, up 57.2% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion. Overall, demand for our products remains healthy across all areas of the business, supply challenges continued throughout the quarter, with ongoing supplier decommits, constraining shipments, and requiring higher cost broker purchases and expedite fees. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 16.3% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 17.6% in Q2. This largely reflected accelerated growth in product revenues, while services and software continued to grow on a more consistent basis. International revenues for the quarter came in at $199.1 million or 17% of total revenue, down from 20% in the second quarter. This reflected strength in U.S. revenues in the period and particularly with our larger cloud customers. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 61.2%, just above the midpoint of our guidance range of 60% to 62%. As previously discussed, our current lower gross margin ranges reflect a healthy cloud mix and higher levels of broker component sourcing and expedite fees. Operating expenses for the period were mostly flat to last quarter at $227.7 million or 19.3% of revenue. R&D spending came in at $150.1 million or 12.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at $148 million. This primarily reflected increased headcount costs in the period with slightly lower new product introduction costs. Sales and marketing expense was $62.8 million or 5.3% of revenue and G&A costs were $14.7 million or 1.3% of revenue, both mostly consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $492.1 million or 41.8% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $6.1 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.3%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $391.9 million or 33.3% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 314.4 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.25, up approximately 69% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.98 billion. We repurchased $47.6 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of approximately $99 per share. As a reminder, we have now repurchased approximately $740 million or 7 million shares against our October 2021, $1 billion board authorization. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. Now, turning to our operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated $134.1 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting strong earnings performance, somewhat offset by increased working capital investments. Increases in inventory and other assets are mainly driven by receipt of components for future shipments, including shipments delayed due to supplier decommits. This trend should reverse once overall supply conditions for these decommitted components improve. DSOs came in at 51 days, flat to last quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7x, down from 1.9x in the prior quarter. Inventory increased to $1.1 billion in the quarter, up from $852.8 million in the prior period, reflecting higher component and peripherals inventory and an increase in switch-related finished goods in transit. Our purchase commitment number for the quarter was $4.3 billion, down from $4.5 billion in Q2. These multiyear purchase commitments reflect overall strength and demand and the current long lead time supply environment. As a reminder, we continue to prioritize newer early lifecycle products for inclusion in these strategies in order to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $941 million, down from $1 billion in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $165 million of the balance, down from $228 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue largely related to customer-specific acceptance clauses for new products with our larger customers. Accounts payable days were 56 days, down from 63 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.4 million. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we came into the year calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth, somewhat balanced across our market sectors and heavily constrained by supply. We now expect revenue growth for the year of approximately 45% at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance with a healthy contribution coming from our cloud titan customers in what has remained a stubbornly constrained supply environment. Our cloud titan customers are now expected to account for approximately 45% of our revenue for the year with major contributions from Meta and Microsoft. Demand from our enterprise and provider businesses has also been strong, exceeding our original expectations from a demand perspective, but with revenue somewhat constrained by supply. We expect gross margin pressure to continue in the quarter with some continued need for broker purchases and expedite fees in response to ad-hoc supplier decommits combined with a healthy cloud mix. Even allowing for the lower gross margins, we expect healthy operating margins for the quarter, again demonstrating the resiliency of the business model with significant bottom line flow-through from increased revenue scale. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $1.175 billion to $1.2 billion; gross margin of approximately 60% to 62%; operating margin of approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21.5% with diluted shares on a post-fit basis of approximately 316 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tim Long : Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about kind of the enterprise and campus strategy. Obviously, you guys have been growing pretty well there. If you could kind of update the $400 million bogey for the year and you have mentioned [Technical Difficulty] Jayshree Ullal : We lost him. Tim Long : [Technical Difficulty] Jayshree Ullal : Why don\u2019t \u2013 I think I will interpret your question, Tim, even though I only heard half of it, which is what is your status on campus and enterprise strategy and how are you doing the $400 million target? Obviously, we will get back to you when we have completed the year. But at this point, we would say that the strength of our campus business from an order perspective is very strong and we should expect to receive $400 million. We are very supply constrained. So we are not yet sure if we will hit the $400 million from a revenue and shipment perspective. Tim Long : I am sorry, if you could just touch on the wireless LAN contribution. It sounds like that\u2019s doing a little bit better now. Sorry about that. I was muffled a little. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, we are very pleased with our wireless LAN contribution. If you think back \u2013 we acquired Mojo Networks in 2018, late 2018, early 2019 and it was a very small single-digit business. And we expect the wireless LAN contribution to become a triple-digit business next year. Liz Stine : Thank you, Tim. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. Spectacular results for the quarter, for the year, in fact of the results last year. And I guess the question really boils down to are we going to see a reversion to more normalized growth? And if that happens, does that bring the margins back into the 37% range? And have we set ourselves up against extremely difficult comps as we go into 2023. How do we think about the mechanics of where we are alternatively? Clearly, supply constraints persist, you sound more constrained than you had earlier, and that would invite me that at least for the first half of next year or even longer, you might still be in the strong growth trajectory. Can you just address how we should be thinking about the environment as we move forward. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Alex, thank you for the kind words, and I\u2019ll tee it up and certainly let Ita speak to some of the details you are asking about. First of all, I just want to say I\u2019m very proud of the team for executing. As you know, we came into the year expecting 30% growth. And here we are telling you it\u2019s going to be 45%. So a huge contribution from Anshul and the team, not only on the cloud titans, but all on the enterprise and rest of the cloud business, as we call it by Chris Schmidt and Ashwin, a lot to be proud of, especially as the numbers get larger. So as you think about the numbers getting larger, it\u2019s going to be difficult to sustain 45% growth every year. I\u2019d love to have it. But as you know, Arista is a volatile business, and you have to think of us across a 3 to 5-year CAGR, not just on an annual basis. So I still think we have a TAM. We\u2019re going to do very well. But with the loan uncertainty of recession and CapEx spend, etcetera, it\u2019s definitely difficult to predict beyond a year. Having, said that, I think, as I said before, we\u2019re having one of our best ever years in 2022. And even though the comps will be difficult, we feel confident that if supply chain gives us some relief, we can do well in 2023 as well. Ita, would you like to add. Ita Brennan : Yes, I think, Alex, if you go back to the business model, Obviously, the gross margin kind of variability that we see that\u2019s kind of inherent to the business model is to do with the mix of the business, right? And that kind of works very nicely when you see accelerated cloud you see that flow through to the operating margin line even though it might be impacting the gross margin in that time period, right? As we talk next Thursday, we\u2019ll talk some more about kind of what the growth rates look like for next year and kind of how that flows through the model. But there is no doubt that when we accelerate growth like this, it\u2019s hard for us to accelerate spending in the same rate and you never really kind of catch up for that right? Jayshree Ullal : It\u2019s one to be proud of. Alex Henderson : Thanks so much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is now open. Paul Silverstein : I guess I shouldn\u2019t ask you what everybody wants to know, which is what\u2019s your outlook for next year? Jayshree Ullal : You wait a couple of more days, Paul. Just a couple of more days. Paul Silverstein : Asking everybody else is asking, so it\u2019s sort of at selling from the numbers that macro had much, if any impact, but last week did identify macro as a meaningful driver of a very declining outlook. Any thoughts you can share in terms of what you\u2019re seeing? Is it affecting one iota customer decisions as to your products and solutions. Any thoughts would be appreciated? Jayshree Ullal : Look, I don\u2019t think Arista is a bellwether for macro. So we\u2019ll let the pundits on economists speak about that. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that data center spend has been very strong. And we\u2019re confident of our near-term strength, both in Cloud Titans, Enterprise and Campus. If there is a place that we see some softening at all geographically, I would point to Europe. They have had effect of the pandemic, the energy crisis, the war, the Brexit, it\u2019s just a whole lot of things going on there. But our numbers are small. And even there, I would say it\u2019s more enough to execute better. So overall, macro is not yet an issue for us. We\u2019ll keep a vigilant eye on it, but so far, so good. Paul Silverstein : Jayshree, just to be clear, you\u2019re not seeing elongated sales cycles, you\u2019re not seeing cutbacks, deferrals or cancellations to any appreciable extent in orders, especially from enterprise. I appreciate that you\u2019re small, but your enterprise is not nothing. It\u2019s a growing business. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but historically, in times of economic duress, most organizations have declined to change vendors or put off changes in their infrastructure that would result in bringing a new vendor like yourself? Jayshree Ullal : Right. I don\u2019t think Arista is any more a new vendor. I think we are the best-of-breed vendor. And what we see, especially in networking, unlike any\u2026 Paul Silverstein : Non-incumbent. Jayshree Ullal : Yes [indiscernible]. I would say if anything, Paul, just to answer your question more directly, unlike server or storage, networking is a very, very strategic spend. There is a long qualification cycle that goes in this proof-of-concept labs is intense testing for scale. And we\u2019re all struggling with lead times. So switching windows doesn\u2019t give you any particular advantage. And if you\u2019re looking for best-of-breed and best operational advantages, our customers would prefer to wait for us. So of course, we don\u2019t want to test their patients. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to execute. You\u2019re seeing that in our purchase commitment, but we\u2019ve got to execute even better. Paul Silverstein : Alright. Appreciate the response. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to get a little bit of help understanding how to think about the purchase order commitment. Just looking at the prior 10-Q filing, you had a 12-month commitment of like $2.9 billion, and you mentioned today that the overall commitment came down a little bit to $4.3 billion. But what I\u2019m struggling with is if we just sort of try to back into implied revenue, it\u2019s well above what most of the street is modeling for the next year. And there are a number of ways that we could think about it. You could either write off inventory, you could hold higher inventory levels or certainly you could have much higher revenue than we expect. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some advice on how to interpret these purchase order commitment? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes, Simon, I think obviously, the goal is to make the purchase commitments that we need to support the business, but it is multiyear, right? And we are thinking about this kind of longer-term than just the year that\u2019s ahead, right? So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the numbers kind of not match perfectly to whatever your revenue assumption is for just for 2023, right? So well, again, we\u2019ll talk about 2023 and the growth rate when we get to the Analyst Day. And then maybe you can ask this question again, and we\u2019ll try to provide some more guidance, but it really is about being multiyear, and some of these products are early-stage products where we believe we can put [indiscernible] there is a limited risk in terms of E&O and reserves and really you\u2019re tying up cash, but that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 that\u2019s worth it in terms of being able to have the products and have the components in place when we need them. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Ita and Jayshree, maybe if you could just comment on whether some of the upside that you\u2019re seeing from the Cloud Titans this year is due to kind of greater ability to serve them and get them more product than they wanted or if you\u2019re actually getting kind of stronger orders than expected? And just kind of on the deferred revenue, being recognized if there are projects that are kind of changing and timing that led to kind of the stronger-than-expected results. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Meta. So I think it\u2019s fair to say, as Anshul has often said that our relationship and partnership with the Cloud Titans continues to be strong and couldn\u2019t be better. especially with Microsoft and Meta, who we fully expect to be greater than 10% concentration. I wish we could ship them more. And I think if they were hearing this call, they would be saying, I wish you could ship us more too. So I don\u2019t think it is a case of shipping more. I think it\u2019s a case of demand from them and a very strategic partnership at the engineering level, at the network design level, at the operational level, at the procurement level and actually Anshul, I like you do \u2013 since you\u2019re dealing with this daily, say some more. Anshul Sadana : Meta, the demand from these customers is just strong. Yes, there is some timing of revenue and deferred and so on. That\u2019s not what\u2019s leading into their strength, the raw demand from these customers continues to be strong. They want to do more build-outs. If you look at how many data centers and regions they want to build out, it\u2019s very strong. you look at their DCI ads with 400-gig and 100-kilometer type of distances. Building big regions. That\u2019s very, very strong. And they love our execution. As Jayshree mentioned, if they could get them more product, they would happily take it as well. So all in all, a phenomenal outcome compared to where about 2 years ago, but in a very healthy cycle with our cloud customers. Ita Brennan : And Matt, on the deferred, I mean nothing for the year and stage, right? If you look at it year-to-date, the really the deferred is not a contributor at all at this point. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about just the broader supply and demand balance. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all \u2013 you included, would love to know when this ends, but I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about evolving from a supply perspective, when you think it maybe get directionally better when it\u2019s really better? And then also curious how it\u2019s influencing the duration of visibility you\u2019re seeing from customers, that has gotten longer. Is it still getting longer? Is it starting to shrink? What are you seeing there? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Hey, Ben, so you asked really two questions, what\u2019s the direction of our visibility? Is it getting longer? Generally, right now, because of our lead times, our visibility is approximately 6 months to a year. And we\u2019ve now had that kind of visibility, particularly from our cloud providers. So directionally, it\u2019s not getting longer, but staying about the same is what I\u2019d tell you. And then what are we seeing on supply chain and when is it going to get better gosh, we \u2013 one of the reasons that Ita, Anshul and myself made such a concerted effort, we got Board approval for very large purchase commitments, multiyear despite a smaller revenue is exactly not to be in the spot we are which is we wanted to get all our components. But sadly, we have almost all the components except a handful and you can\u2019t build a system without the last few components. So we do have still subsidies shortages, as I said before, we expect this to go into 2023. And I think our long lead times will persist in the industry for networking, especially for the next several months and for 2023. So we don\u2019t see a lot of relief in sight until we can get all the components being short of a few components still means we can\u2019t build the system. So expect us \u2013 it\u2019s improving, but expect us to really only see improvement a year from now. Ben Bollin : Thanks, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt Niknam : Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. On the guide for the non-GAAP op income margin. So I think you did 42% ish this quarter. I know the guide talks about a nearly 200 basis point step down despite stable gross margins. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk about where you see opportunity for incremental investment. And then if I could just sneak in one follow-up on the deferred revenue question. So it looked like deferred dipped about \u2013 deferred revenue dipped about $92 million sequentially. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s baked into the revenue outlook for 4Q from a deferred perspective? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. So on the deferred, the product deferred decline in Q3 is about $60 million. So there is a piece of it is just services, service contract timing and stuff in there. So really, the thing that\u2019s kind of directly linked to the revenue is about $60 million. For Q4 in the guide, we\u2019re assuming no deferred, right, and no deferred impact, right? So that\u2019s that question. And then the other question was the expenses and operating margin. I think look, we were flat pretty much on OpEx in Q3. Some of that is timing. That wasn\u2019t the original plan, obviously. So some of that will recover. And some of \u2013 as we head into Q4, we\u2019ll see some sales commissions and other things at the back end of the year, tend to be a little higher as well, right? So it\u2019s kind of a combination of maybe some timing and then just the normal kind of Q4 dynamics. Matt Niknam : Thank you very much. Ita Brennan : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Matt. Welcome to your first call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Fahad Najam : Thank you for taking my question. Jayshree, I think at a recent investor conference, you said that you think the industry could grow double-digit revenue, if I recall, you said you were connecting clouds of data or centers of data. So I want to understand your response to a previous question that if the supply chain improved next year, you would do well versus what that double-digit outlook that you had earlier? Is that what you\u2019re thinking? Can you help us understand? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Fahad. I\u2019ll try. I think in terms of demand, we fully expect to grow double digits next year, and I hope for years to come unless there is some real macro issues. Specific to next year, again, we will guide specifically at Analyst Day. But I think if supply chain would be relieved, we would grow double-digits, if supply chain continues to be constrained, will still grow double-digits. So either way, it must do well next year. Fahad Najam : I have one follow-up. Jayshree Ullal : It\u2019s a question of how well. Fahad Najam : What\u2019s the risk of your cloud customers having some level of inventory buildup? I understand that there is a significant constraint on the networking equipment, but there has been evidence of inventory mismatches in the server and storage space as cloud titans and so what\u2019s the [indiscernible]? Jayshree Ullal : Very little, Fahad. I think it\u2019s important to understand that nobody has been in a position to have any kind of inventory on networking. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Yes, Fahad. Our customers will consume everything we can ship. We are not worried about inventory build out any time soon. Fahad Najam : Appreciate it. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Fahad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, Ladies. And great quarter. I guess a couple of questions. Jayshree, you talked about your activity with the cloud guys and how that cloud guys do want diversity and suppliers. And of course, there is always timing and projects where you kind of run ahead or below where you probably should be just given the timing of projects. Do you get a sense right now on \u2013 if you\u2019re punching above or below your weight kind of and I\u2019m calling weight, whatever the cloud guys really think you should be at long-term from a share standpoint? Jayshree Ullal : That\u2019s \u2013 welcome back, Ittai. We haven\u2019t chatted in a long time. That\u2019s a really good question. You had to ask a tough one. I do think we\u2019re punching at our weight in terms of demand, even above our weight. In terms of actually supplying, maybe below our weight, but by the way, I\u2019m only talking about the cloud guys, it\u2019s not myself. Anshul, do you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Well, I\u2019m not cared to refer boxing match. But in terms of supply, and overall demand, our customers like to diversify. I think most customers have already set their plans. We\u2019re not expecting any big dramatic changes from here on. And we talked about a couple of years now, that customers truly like our product. They like our occasion. The partnership is healthy. Even not worried because of claims from many companies on how they\u2019ll be ahead and there will be us and all of that. In the end, we\u2019ve done really well. If someone takes a share in one of the roles, we take share in other roles, too. So as a result, because of the expansion in WAN and Edge and routing other use cases, we\u2019ve done well, and our expectation is we\u2019ll actually continue to do going forward as well. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, Jayshree, I mean you did talk about the weakness in Europe, and it\u2019s obvious that there should be weakness over there. But your business over there is down on a year-over-year basis. And I guess I\u2019m kind of wondering \u2013 the traction and the share gains that you\u2019re having in the U.S., one would think that even in the current environment, if you\u2019re able to get share gains in Europe as well, you\u2019d still be able to get growth out of there, maybe not 30%, 40%, but perhaps a 10, 15. So help me understand what \u2013 maybe you could go later deeper into what\u2019s going on in Europe? And do you think that the current environment, maybe going back to your previous question, Paul\u2019s question that in this environment, perhaps customers are just less likely to consider a change to just stick with what they have got and maybe that\u2019s a hindering element? Jayshree Ullal : So \u2013 no, I don\u2019t \u2013 I was answering the question time more on, is there a recession in a broad sense, if at all, we are generally seeing very strong demand worldwide. If at all, we are seeing some softness in weakness, it would be in parts of Europe because of all the things through. Specific to Arista, I see no reason mission to be growing everywhere, including Europe. But our rate of growth in Europe may be slower for exactly the reasons you mentioned that their overall economy, if you look at the GDP and if you look at the top three countries, Germany, UK and from France, none of them are really substantially investing. So I think because we have small numbers, we can do fine. We should be able to still grow double digits, but that is the only sign of recession we have so far seen. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Very good. Good luck. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Just to correct you, we did \u2013 we are growing year-over-year in Europe as well. Ittai Kidron : Okay, alright. Ita Brennan : Yes, these numbers, Ittai, I have a lot of cloud influence in them. So it depends when you strip that out, the kind of in-region business is growing. Ittai Kidron : Okay. Well, maybe, Ita, on that point, did the U.S. grow? Can you tell us how much the U.S. grew without the titans? Ita Brennan : Off the top of my head, no. Yes. Jayshree Ullal : U.S., we do by year-end. Ita Brennan : Yes. We\u2019ll show you those done at year-end for on the verticals of the business. Ittai Kidron : Appreciate it. Good luck, thanks. Ita Brennan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is now open. David Vogt : Thanks, guys for taking the question. I just want to go back to the margin performance. If I go back to 2019, I think your titan mix was relatively similar to where we are today, maybe a little bit less, but your gross margins were almost 300 \u2013 and your product gross margins were almost 300 basis points higher. So, can we kind of disaggregate that delta is how much of that is from expedited freight, supply chain versus maybe somewhat structurally lower margins with some of the new titans and/or Microsoft and Meta. And then on OpEx, just a quick question, growth has been 15% to 20% sort of on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of how we should think about the business as we progress over a couple of years cycle? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I think on the gross margin piece, I mean there is more cloud mix in the business. I think that we have seen than we have ever seen. Jayshree Ullal : This is the highest mix we have had. Ita Brennan : But we also have \u2013 remember, don\u2019t forget the expediting fees and stuff we have talked about the 200 basis points to 300 basis points. I mean that is still there. I think that will be there for a while, certainly in our Q4 guide. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of those two, right. When you think back in that time period, you could run the business for costs, right. And we were optimizing costs in every way. Today, we are kind of hamstrung because of supply. So, it\u2019s inefficient right now, to be honest, right, particularly with these de-commits. So, we need to get out of that, and then we can kind of start to drive for some improvements on the gross margin side as well. I think on the OpEx side, if you look back historically, we have probably been in the 20%, 22% growth type range on OpEx except in times of disruption, right. So, I mean that\u2019s probably not a bad way to think about it. David Vogt : Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. So, it sounds like your structural margins on the titans are relatively unchanged over the last, call it, 2 years to 3 years outside of the expedite fee and supply chain. Is that a fair characterization on the product side? Ita Brennan : I think it depends on the product mix to some degree, right. I mean you have got \u2013 there is more \u2013 you would have to do more disaggregation to really get to what\u2019s happening there, right. But there is \u2013 the product mix is a part of that as well. David Vogt : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the good quarter. I guess the question is we on the cloud titan side, on a broader level of vertical, we are seeing an increased focus on profitability from the cloud company. And I am just wondering, as they start to focus perhaps more of the resources on their own core competencies, could you see a lot of these cloud companies started to shift from building their own solution on the networking side, which is starting to buy them more often nothing understand, a, from your existing customer base, are you seeing an expansion of engagement with them beyond what you have traditionally done? And then, b, more importantly, are you seeing newer customers come to you that want to start buying for you other than building it organically themselves? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. I will take it in. Thank you. I will take it in two parts. The cloud titans have always had a combination of build and buy. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changing. They continue to look at whether it\u2019s SONiC or FBOSS, working closely with us. But in some layers, they are absolutely sourcing their own products and technologies. At the same time, I think the cloud titans have to run very mission-critical networks, and they recognize the value in the partnership at an engineering level to not build themselves, but really co-develop with us. So, these, I would say, are not built or buy. They really co-developed partnerships where they get the best of both. And despite all of their focus on costs, believe me, they are getting their best of both because they are getting great cost for us without making the direct investment themselves, and it really is a unique partnership. Anshul, do you want to say some more to that? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Amit, in general, these cloud companies keep exploring every possible way to go faster. There is a misunderstanding in tender. But it\u2019s on the Wall Street side of things, sometimes people have said, hey, people want to find something that\u2019s cheaper because they can save money. The reality is, they have to look at their total overall business impact. And if they can go faster and get a competitive advantage, that\u2019s a huge benefit to them. So, most of these companies do not build their own products or stacks just a bit cheaper. They build it because there is some secret sauce. There is some IP, there is some integration. That\u2019s what you are seeing with the co-development we do with Meta and Microsoft, whether it\u2019s on the FBOSS, SONiC side or some of the hardware we developed as well. The other titans explore the same use cases are similar themes with us on an ongoing basis. So, these are not new discussions to us. And I think we will continue to execute well. Clearly, the majority of the business continues to come from our top two customers. We are happy with that. The others are engaged as we talked to us on previously, but those are long running projects, but then I am going to get to a decision point and actually impact, you have to wait several years and we will get there. But there is nothing that\u2019s changed in the industry. People are in general happy with the way status quo has been maintained with a little bit of let\u2019s explore other options in working with companies like us, where possible. Liz Stine : Thanks Amit. Operator, we can take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations as well on the quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more of a technical question. As we think about 400 gig and you think about the traction you are seeing with your cloud titans as well as some of the specialty cloud guys, I am just curious if you could level set us on where you think we are at in terms of the 400-gig cycle. And on that topic as well, any updated thoughts on this idea of the AI fabric networks, representing an incremental adjacent growth driver for your business at the cloud titans? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Unquestionably, I think while majority of the enterprise is still on 10 and 40, we are seeing more and more combinations of 100 gig and 400 gig, not only in the cloud titans, but also in the rest of the customer base. Just to level set on the numbers, you may recall that we had 70 or so customers in 2020. We doubled to 300 into 2021. And if I had to guess, I would say we double again in 2022 in terms of 400 gig customers. But the important thing to remember here is they are not just 400. There really are a permutation and combination of multiple speeds, multiple use cases. And together, they are an important contributor, but it\u2019s never an isolation 100. Some of them are uplinks. Some of them are native connections. Some of them, as Anshul alluded, are DCI routing solutions. So, our market share in this combination of 100, 400 and in some cases, 200 is number one for a good reason, because they really have to work together with the right software and right management. The AI spine cluster is emerging as a new use case. It\u2019s still early days, and we have talked about it some. We will talk about it more at the Analyst Day, but more use case emergence for applications that really push the speed and latency and performance and predictable bandwidth of 400 gig is going to add additional fuel to our 400 gig demand. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thank you, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you. Jayshree and Ita, I noticed in your press release that you made a comment to new market expansion. Could you elaborate a little bit like what is that, or is that going to be a focus for the event on Thursday? Because I assume it\u2019s not just continual strength of where you are seeing or maybe it is. But if you can give any expansion on that, because I know in the past or currently, you have seen a lot of expansion in the campus growth, but I saw the new market expansion literally, word for word, and I got to think there were some purposes behind that. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Maybe you read more into my quote than I meant. At the end of the day, Arista is viewed as a data center company. But if you look at the diversified portfolio, we are trying to say we are entering many more new markets like routing, like campus and even subsets of the market like securing our solutions better with encryption, with better visibility and observability. And indeed, we will talk more about new market expansion in a couple of days. So, undoubtedly, we are moving from becoming a pure data center company to many more markets that center the data in different locations. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Thank you. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess it\u2019s a similar question to the last one. But Jayshree, I just wanted to understand, as we look at your growth with cloud customers, how should we think about sort of that growth relative to sort of how much of that growth is coming from the additional use cases you are addressing beyond traditional switching. So, for example, like DCI or routing, how much of that is probably contributing to the strong growth you are seeing with cloud customers? As we think about sort of the next couple of years, how should we think about the \u2013 given the visibility you have in terms of designs, how is that sort of momentum progressing from here on? And just a quick follow-up there. So, outside of Facebook and Meta as we think about the engagement with other cloud companies, is that on some of the new use cases, or is that traditional switching in leaf and spine? Jayshree Ullal : First, I think it\u2019s super important to understand that even though it\u2019s leaf and spine, Samik, these data centers, whether they would be building them at a regional level or a mega scale level, the leaf and spine is really going to expand and explode as the cloud titans expand their presence. So, that growth \u2013 that organic growth that we began our journey with them will continue. And we will depend on that growth. In addition to that, as Anshul said, we will have new use cases on the WAN, the regional, the DCI and especially AI spine, particularly with the cloud titans. It may expand to \u2013 those new use cases may also expand to other specialty cloud providers. But I would say we would be looking for sources of growth in both areas, expansion of the existing data centers into new locations and more scale as well as new use cases. Just one and half a dozen of the other. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to go back to the question of the cloud titan customers potentially building inventory. And I guess on an earlier question, Anshul, you were pretty dismissive of that idea. I guess I am just wondering what additional detail you might kind of have that supports that idea. And if I look at your business, you have been growing product sales 55%, 67% year-on-year, the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s pretty outstanding growth. And given the mix shift in the company I would guess that the cloud titan customers have been growing 70% or 80% year-on-year, right? So, I know you guys are building your own inventories. Many companies are building their own inventory in the supply chain environment. So, I do think it is an important question and I guess I m wondering exactly how you know customers aren\u2019t building inventory in your stuff. Thanks. Anshul Sadana : George, that is a good question. I get asked that internally daily because we have to worry about what\u2019s going on in the other side, our customers buffering. I would say the best sign is the number of phone calls I get or Jayshree gets, or others in the company get on when are you shipping. So, these customers are still roughly handout. There are a few places where they can still calibrate for the computer to come up and so on. But in most cases, customers are desperate, the deployment teams are waiting for the gear to show up, and they light it up as quickly as possible. You have to realize where we came from. Since the start of COVID, the world has been constrained. And that constraint over such a long period, generally means people can\u2019t execute the project timelines, and they are still short. At some point, this will recover. But nowhere close to that in today\u2019s time. So, I think it will take a long time, maybe I will say George, if supply recovers by the end of \u201823, I think that\u2019s when customers will feel comfortable, and they will eventually have an opportunity to buffer up, but yet not there today. George Notter : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to go to gross margins. I think Ita, you have made two references on this call regarding just the trajectory of margins. I think you said that we are probably not going to see an improvement in gross margins for at least a year from now. And then the other comment you made regarding the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, I think you said it\u2019s going to be there a while. So, does that imply that we should be modeling gross margins at least through maybe the first half of 2023, a little bit more in line to last couple of quarters? That\u2019s the first question. Second question is if you were to give us an idea on how many ports or how many switches with 400-gig ports shift in 2022, could you give us kind of like a percentage of total shipments and maybe what that would look like in 2023? Ita Brennan : Yes. Just on the gross margin. I think given where we are today, I think it\u2019s not a bad idea to model that gross margin as being kind of constrained until we get out from under the constraint, honestly. I think that\u2019s a very real kind of cost that we are carrying, and it\u2019s not clear yet exactly when that starts to improve. So, yes, I think it\u2019s not a bad idea to hold it there until we are able to kind of show real demonstrable improvements and more predictability, I guess on these de-committed parts. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And to answer your question, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have exact numbers on 400 gig, but if I had to guess even though we are gaining customers, most of them are as uplink. So, the number of ports is still small. I would say our penetration is well under 10%, maybe even 5%. That\u2019s just a good guess. Sami Badri : And then thank you for answering gross margin and that piece. But when we go into 2023, are you seeing almost like a sharp increase in that from sub-10% to obviously much higher than that or not quite yet? Jayshree Ullal : No. If we go into \u201823, the way to think of this is people are still migrating from 10 gig and 10 gig and 40 gig to 100 gig will still be the largest migration. As a result of that migration, you will see more deployment of 400 gig. So, 400 gig will still be small. Maybe it will go from 5 to 10. Sami Badri : Perfect. Thank you very much. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey. Very nice quarter and also results. Well, it\u2019s a metric, Ita, I know you don\u2019t really want to emphasize as much as others do in your space. You still have visibility here and confidence in that visibility. Maybe asking in a different way than others. As supply chain here starts to normalize, how are you guys thinking about how long that backlog actually takes to turn back to a more normal level? Is it four quarters, six quarters, kind of eight quarters, that\u2019s currently in your thought process for next year? Are you seeing any change in cancellation rates? And then just lastly, what\u2019s going on with that services deferred revenue as in aggregate, we were down about $92 million and product was only \u2013 was down $63 million. So, trying to understand why services is being impacted here? Ita Brennan : Yes. We would start with the services piece. I mean it\u2019s just all about the timing of the service agreements, right. If you think about what deferred venue is, if I sign a contract on day one, it\u2019s a 2-year, 3-year contract, you are going to have the maximum amount of deferred revenue you can have. And then when it comes towards the renewal of that contract, you are going to have the least amount of deferred revenue that you could have from a services perspective, right. So, it\u2019s purely on timing on the services side, right. The lumpier thing is obviously on the product, but the services is truly just the mechanics of how the services contracts flow, right. And then I guess on the cancellations, etcetera, I mean we have not seen any change in the business. I think we are to Anshul\u2019s point, I mean we are still seeing customers very intensely focused on getting products at this point. I am not going to try to age out the backlog that\u2019s kind of we are not quite there ready to do that just given some of the uncertainties on supply and so on. Jayshree Ullal : And I think as lead times improve, we expect customer visibility to shrink. But right now, we are working hard on that lead time improvement. So, we are a year away from that. James Fish : Got it. Thanks. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Tom Blakey with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Tom Blakey : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, and Happy Halloween, everybody. Looking at your \u2013 I am curious about the cadence of the cloud titan revenue. It seems like a big uptick here in the second half, if I am characterizing that correctly from kind of the mid to high-30s to get to that 45% for the year, you need to imply kind of over half. And if I do that simple arithmetic, it implies that maybe the cumulative revenue of service providers, specialty service providers, financial enterprise will be kind of flattening out in the second half. So, just maybe comment on, is my characterization correct. And there and as a follow-up, are we relying a little bit more on one of those particular cloud titans more than the other? And about a correlation to actual CapEx spend comment would be helpful, too. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think as you look at the year, I mean obviously, we have been ramping revenues and ramping shipments. So, we have been ramping kind of with cloud as well, right. And cloud has grown faster. It started off from a lower base, obviously. So, it did need to recover, if you like, it was at 30%, which is pretty much the lowest we have seen it last year, and we \u2013 so it\u2019s definitely recovered from there. I think on the rest of the business, the demand is there. The demand has certainly exceeded our expectations when we came into the year. But given the shipment constraints, etcetera, it\u2019s kind of a bit of \u2013 we have been trying to stick to the FIFO first in, first out as much as we can. And so that has been more constrained. I think we will expect to see that kind of start to improve, hopefully, here as we head into next year. Tom Blakey : Thank you. Meta versus Microsoft maybe into the second half of the year? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We will have to wait to year-end for that, I think. Tom Blakey : Okay. Thanks everybody. Liz Stine : This concludes the Arista Networks third quarter 2022 earnings call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31, 2022. If you would like a copy of this release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, longer term financial outlook for 2023 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing capacity, inventory purchases and inflationary pressures on our business, extended lead times, product innovation, and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. And I am glad we avoided Valentine\u2019s Day this time. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. 2022 has certainly been a record year for Arista. You might recall, in November 2021 Analyst Day, we had given you a guidance of 30% growth and instead have achieved well beyond that at 48% growth for the year, driving to an annual revenue of $4.38 billion with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.58, translating to an EPS growth of 58% for 2022. Indeed, a memorable year. Let\u2019s get back to some Q4 2022 specifics. We delivered $1.276 billion for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 15.8% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 61%, influenced by our supply chain overhead and cloud titan concentration. International contribution registered at 23.5% with the Americas at 76.5% in 2022. This was one of our strongest performing international quarters in recent history. In terms of Q4 2022 verticals, cloud titans was our largest and first, followed by enterprise and then specialty cloud providers at third place, financials at fourth, and service providers at fifth place. In 2023, we will report the three segment sectors instead of the verticals. Shifting to the segment sector revenue for 2022, cloud titans contributed significantly at approximately 46%, resulting in a triple-digit growth annually. Enterprise and financials together was strong at approximately 32%, while the providers were at approximately 22%. Both Meta and Microsoft are now far greater than 10% customers at 25.5% and 16% contribution respectively. Clearly, we continue to enjoy a strong and strategic partnership with M&M. With that, I\u2019d like to now invite Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer, to shed more light on our cloud titan performance. Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. Our partnership with Microsoft and Meta grew even stronger last year. Both of these titans are in the midst of deploying our next-gen 100, 200 and 400-gig products at several [key tails] (ph) of their networks. The cloud is reshaping the Internet with their massive footprint, global backbone and edge partnerships. We are proud to have our products designed into pretty much all of these use cases. In addition, our business with the other titans continued to grow as well. We had additional design wins in backbone WAN and edge [Indiscernible]. This past year, we ramped our 7800R3 series, high-density 400-gig, near-lossless spine. We also introduced several new products based on Tomahawk 4 and our deep buffer Virtual Output Queue systems based on Jericho 2, 7280 and the 7800R3 modular systems. While we will continue to add 100 and 400-gig products to our portfolio, we also launched our first 1 rack unit 25-terabit product, with 800-gig ports that can be broken out as 2 x 400-gig. These products have good use cases and high-speed applications, such as artificial intelligence. EOS, our high-quality resilient network data lake-based operating system, has also matured and now supports cloud scale with multiple copies of the Internet routing table. We co-develop with our cloud customers who greatly appreciate Arista engineering expertise. This past year, we furthered our partnership with Microsoft with SONiC support on many of our high-volume switches. Our work with them on automation and monitoring our skills is very well received for Azure and Bing deployments. At Meta, we have our co-developed platforms, such as the Tomahawk 3 7368 and 7388, which helped them improve throughput and datacenter power efficiencies. FPaaS and EOS are deployed with very high reliability in the cluster fabrics using these products. Our deployments in their backbone and in generative AI and recommendation engines with the 7800 series are now smoothly deployed in production. We don\u2019t control macro. We don\u2019t control our customers\u2019 CapEx plans. But when they do spend, we are there with them to make these next-generation cloud networks successful. AI is a good example where we are continuing to grow into next-generation architectures with our cloud customers. The use cases we are involved in are generally core to their business and not an optional spend. Our cloud journey has come a long way over the last decade. This is still a very exciting market segment given the pace of innovation and our partnerships here. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Anshul. Wow, 2022 was indeed a phenomenal year with the cloud titans and these partnerships have been nurtured for well over a decade with expanded use cases such as these AI workloads. We remain confident of our meaningful share with both Microsoft and Meta and we expect both of them to once again contribute greater than 10% of our total revenue in 2023. In the non-cloud category, we have registered solid number of million-dollar customers as a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise and campus throughout the year. We have now surpassed 9,000 cumulative customers. In terms of 2022 product lines, we have three categories : one, our core cloud and data center products built upon a highly differentiated Arista EOS stack that is successfully deployed across 10, 25, 100, 200 and 400-gig speeds. This drove approximately 68% of our revenue with strong cloud and enterprise spending cycles. We believe that we will continue to gain market share in the high-performance switching and have already grown from the teens to the 20s. In the 100 and 400-gig category, we have now earned the number one position according to industry analysts. We have also doubled our 400-gig customers from 300 in 2021 to over 600 in 2022. Our second market is network adjacencies comprised of routing, replacing routers and our cognitive campus. We doubled our campus orders to exceed $400 million in 2022, but we did fall short of our revenue due to extreme supply chain shortages. We maintain our campus momentum and are aiming for $750 million in revenue by 2025. Our investments in cognitive campus spines, clients, wired and wireless have generated significant customer interest and demand based on CloudVision and CloudVision CUE. Considering this is only our third full year of shipping versus incumbents who have been in the market for 15 to 30 years, we are very proud of our execution. Our vision for a cognitive campus with network-as-a-service and edge-as-a-service based on NetDL is resonating extremely well and being embraced by our campus customers. We have also successfully deployed in many routing edge and peering use-cases, such as securing data in transit with TunnelSec encryption, precision and performance for mobile networks, cloud exchanges and metro Ethernet. Enterprise customers can now deploy EOS with a single EVPN protocol, whether it\u2019s for data center, data center interconnect or WAN, delivering multiple profiles. Just in 2022 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases, 600 new features across 50 new platforms. Stay tuned for more in 2023 as we will be introducing new WAN transit functionality. The campus and routing adjacencies together contribute approximately 14% of revenue. Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, DMF Observability, advanced NDR with Ava sensors for securities. Arista\u2019s subscription-based network services and software contributed approximately 18% of our total product line. We are proud to note that CloudVision exceeded 2,000 cumulative customers, up from 1,500 the prior year and is really a compelling data-driven platform delivering network agility, continuous integration and operational excellence. Arista\u2019s non-cloud wins continue as well. While Arista\u2019s 2022 headline has been the massive contribution from our cloud customers, we are pleased with the momentum of our enterprise and provider customers as well. Arista continues to diversify its business globally with multiple use cases. Helping our prospects and customers realize these operational benefits with modern software and automation has been a recurring theme. And so let me shed a few examples that we have earned a seat at the table at. Our first example highlights the universal cloud network wins in the travel industry. Like many conversations, the customers\u2019 initial ask was to gain more visibility into their infrastructure. We presented our DMF, DANZ Monitoring Fabric solution, but it quickly transitioned to a general data center for all of Arista\u2019s platform offerings. The customer chose our Layer 3 leaf/spine EVPN design for their critical VDI environment. The customer also leveraged CloudVision for their Day 0, Day 1, Day 2 operations using our chassis spine, R3 leaf and out-of-band management to reduce their operational risk. Our second win highlights the financial customers\u2019 choice to proceed with Arista\u2019s best-in-class cognitive campus with wired and wireless solutions. As with every campus opportunity, it was competitive. CloudVision once again was a key differentiator for us as we quickly became their trusted adviser. Our virtual training environment, such as Arista\u2019s Cloud Test, gave architects the relevant hands-on experience. Our low [CVE] (ph) count and commitment to single EOS with high-quality was unmatched by our peers. Arista continues to make inroads on regional Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers. Regional service providers are in the middle of expanding and looking for reliable compressed routing footprint. This third win highlights the evolution of our EOS driving stack, where customers are now deploying EVPN services on top of their MPLS segment core network. Arista\u2019s high-density, 100-gig MPLS routing, together with long-range optics and a fully automated deployment using CloudVision and zero-touch provisioning, delivered that cloud-like operating model. Our next win is an international one in the education sector for high-performance computing. HPC demands low latency, deep buffers and real-time visibility. This customer chose Arista for providing a highly elastic, VXLAN-based leaf/spine pod with best-in-class performance. Consistent technology between our spine and edge leaf, anchored by our flagship 7800 chassis and combined with CloudVision-based real-time telemetry, compliance and automation, really created a lasting impression. Our final win for this quarter\u2019s announcements is an exciting international one in the government sector, where Arista\u2019s 400-gig Ethernet was selected instead of InfiniBand for big data Hadoop cluster deployments. In this case, the customer chose us for 100, 400-gig solution with built-in encryption capabilities. The customer saw clear differentiation in our automated operations, hitless upgrade and full real-time telemetry, ensuring comprehensive visibility of workloads in the fabric. As we enter 2023, Arista is well positioned as a game changer in data-driven client to cloud networking. A key part of this transformation is to make our cloud first principle and bring that to every aspect of the data network. Software functions such as routing for WAN, Zero Trust security and observability are moving into the Arista U.S. stack. We are building upon our cloud network heritage to bring proactive platforms, predictive operations and a complete prescriptive experience, unifying datasets from multiple sources. Our NetDL architecture and AVA, or autonomous virtual assist, using AI and ML and natural language processing techniques is a very compelling combination. Together, this architecture can gather, store and process multiple modalities of network data. And this way, network operators can reconcile all their different silos. 2023 is the start of Arista\u2019s 2.0 journey. Arista 2.0 is our migration from best-of-breed products to best-of-breed platforms as we address our expanded TAM of $50 billion ahead. We are uniquely qualified to bring modern software principles to build that world-class data center and data-driven networking. It is based on that foundational focus on quality, availability, AI-driven deployments with top notch support. And as we undertake this 2.0 journey, we are excited to work with a collaborative ecosystem of our partners, and customers worldwide to realize this vision. In summary, I am so proud of our team\u2019s execution across multiple dimensions despite one of the worst supply chain backdrops ever witnessed. A special thank you to our customers for their patience and support to us last year and to all the Aristans for their hard work and Herculean efforts. Our tireless mission taught us valuable lessons and we expect to emerge stronger. We reiterate our 25% annual growth outlook that we mentioned at the November 2022 Analyst Day as we now aim for $5.47 billion in 2023 in terms of revenue. Now I will turn it over to Ita for financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2022 results and our guidance for Q1 2023 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $1.276 billion, up 54.7% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $1.175 billion to $1.2 billion. While we experienced some improvement in overall component supply in the quarter, shipments remained somewhat constrained with lingering shortages on a handful of parts. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 15.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 16.3% in Q3. This has largely reflected growth in product revenues, while services and software continue to grow on a more consistent basis. International revenues for the quarter came in at $300 million or 23.7% of total revenue, up from 17% in the third quarter. This quarter-over-quarter increase largely reflected improved contributions from our EMEA and region customers in the quarter. Overall, however, 2022 was the year of outsized growth in the U.S., up 61% year-over-year, largely due to domestic strength from our cloud titan customers. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 61%, at the midpoint of our guidance range of approximately 60% to 62%. We continue to recognize incremental supply chain costs in the period combined with a healthy cloud mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $235.3 million or 18.4% of revenue, up from last quarter at $227.7 million. R&D spending came in at $153.2 million or 12% of revenue, up from $150.1 million last quarter. This primarily reflected increased headcount and new product introduction costs in the period. Sales and marketing expenses were $67.4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to $62.8 million last quarter with increased headcount and higher variable compensation expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $14.6 million or 1.1% of revenue consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $543.2 million or 42.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $13.6 million and our effective tax rate was 20%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $445.1 million or 34.9% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 315.2 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.41, up 72% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.024 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased $2.8 million of our common stock. As a reminder, for the year, we have repurchased $670 million or 6.5 million shares at an average price of $104 per share. This leaves us with $257 million available for repurchase under our existing $1 billion Board authorization. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Now turning to operating cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $40 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance, mostly offset by a significant increase in working capital. We experienced growth in inventory with the receipt of components for future shipments, including shipments delayed due to supplier decommits. We also experienced growth in accounts receivable and DSOs in the quarter with a significant ramp in service renewals and product shipments towards the end of the quarter. DSOs came in at 67 days, up from 51 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings and growth in service renewals in the period. Inventory turns were 1.6x, down from 1.7x last quarter. Inventory increased to $1.3 billion in the quarter, up from $1.1 billion in the prior period, reflecting higher key component of peripherals inventory and an increase in switch-related finished goods. Our purchase commitments at the end of the quarter were $3.7 billion, down from $4.3 billion at the end of Q3. We expect this number to continue to decline in future quarters as component lead times improve and we work to optimize our supply position. As a reminder, we have focused this extended purchase commitment strategy on early lifecycle products to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1.041 billion, up from $941 million in Q3. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services-related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $125 million of the balance, down from $165 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance deposits for new products, most recently with our large cloud titan customers. For clarification, this represents a reduction in products related to deferred revenue for the year of approximately $40 million. Account payable days were 43 days, down from 56 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10.5 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. 2022 was a year of outstanding revenue and earnings growth driven by an acceleration in demand from our cloud titan customers, coupled with healthy contributions across the other areas of the business. Supply remains constrained throughout the year and somewhat limited our ability to ramp product shipments in response to this demand. As we head into 2023, we look forward to resolving the final kinks on the supply side and reducing lead times for our customers. As outlined at our Analyst Day, we expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for 2023 of approximately 25%. This reflects continued healthy demand across all our market sectors, but recognizing that as lead times improve, we should expect to see some reduction in visibility. In terms of quarterly trends, you should expect accelerated year-over-year growth in Q1, moderating as the year progressing versus more difficult year-over-year comps. On the gross margin front, we expect to continue consuming broker parts and other inflated cost items in the first quarter. And this, combined with the continuing healthy cloud contribution, will pressure gross margins. Beyond that, we should see some steady improvement as we move through the year with fewer broker parts and the opportunity to optimize the manufacturing ramp. Now turning to spending and investments. We remain cognizant of the overall macro environment and we will be prudent to making investments which we move through the year. You should however expect us to make targeted hires in R&D and go-to-market as the team sees the opportunity to secure talent. On the cash front, FY 2022 was a year where much of the $1.4 billion net income generated by the business was consumed by incremental working capital needs an additional cash tax payments under Section 174, which defers the deductibility of R&D spending. As we head into 2023, we should expect to focus on supply chain and working capital optimization while recognizing the need for balance in areas of higher supply risk or where our lead times remain extended. Interest income should continue to increase as we move through the year with $20 million in Q1, growing towards a quarterly contribution of $40 million exiting the year. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, gross margin of approximately 60%, operating margin at approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21.5% with diluted shares on a post-split basis of approximately 316 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to ask, I guess, Ita, for you on the order trend. We all know that the revenue is incredibly strong right now because of all the lead time supply chain issues, but maybe some visibility on how orders are trending versus revenue. Ita Brennan : Yes. Jason, as you know, we don\u2019t really talk about orders and backlog. I think we did talk about kind of healthy demand across the various pieces of the business. And obviously, we\u2019re reaffirming the guidance for 2023. So there is good support for that. Jayshree, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that. Jayshree Ullal : No. I think you said it well. Order trends in 2022 were good. We will wait watch and see if the macro has broader effects in \u201823, but our guide and our tone effects that we are pretty positive at the moment. Jason Ader : So no impact from macro of significance thus far on orders? Jayshree Ullal : When we have something to state, we will, Jason. So far, we don\u2019t. Jason Ader : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jason. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I guess, when I think about this 25% growth in calendar \u201823, how do you think it stacks up across the three verticals for you folks? That would be really helpful in the sense kind of where do you see the strongest versus weaker growth. And then on the cloud titan side, as you think about growth in \u201823 and maybe even beyond, do you think that\u2019s really a function of what their CapEx plans look like on the networking side or do you think there is a bigger narrative around the share gain potential against white box solutions, especially as workloads get more complicated, that could help you as well? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Well, I\u2019ll take the first one, and I\u2019m sure Anshul will have a few words on the second. How does this break down? If you look at 20 \u2013 let me go back to 2021. We had a very nice even split, and cloud titan was actually kind of on the low side. It was 30%, if I remember right, 30-30-40. And if you look at 2022, which we are called titan was outsized when the 30 went to 46. If I had to guess, I would say we\u2019d be between those two numbers. I still think we will have a very healthy cloud titan mix. But enterprise momentum continues to be strong, and you\u2019ll see a contribution from that as well as the Tier 2 specialty cloud providers and service providers as well. So I think it will \u2013 my guess is it will look somewhere between \u201821 and \u201822 in terms of split. We will see as the quarter progressed. In terms of the CapEx and the impact of that cloud titans, look, we don\u2019t exactly and equivalently track to CapEx, but eventually, CapEx is an indicator of future \u2013 of our future cloud titan progress. I don\u2019t believe at this point that our progress is coming from white box or specific things like commodity, things like that. It\u2019s really coming from, as Anshul pointed out, a very strategic seat at the table on new use cases like AI workloads, which has a multiplicative factor on our bandwidth. So I believe we will have a real seat at the table, especially with Microsoft and Meta. And we will continue to see what the use cases are that we can imagine beyond \u201823. But we\u2019ve been working on this for 10 years, and I think it will continue to be strong. Amit Daryanani : Thank you, Amit. We can take our next question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. I hope you\u2019ll into a clarification. I just want to make sure you said Microsoft was 16 and Meta was 25 or do I have that backwards? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. 25.5 on Meta and Microsoft, 16. Paul Silverstein : Okay. Now for the question, what portion of your cloud titan revenue in general and how much of growth in Microsoft and Meta was \u2013 if you know it, what\u2019s your sense for how much of that was AI-driven? Any visibility as to the growth in AI and its impact on demand for your switches and various use cases over the course of the next few years with your cloud titan customers in general, including Microsoft and Meta? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We see AI as a very, very important use case and workload for all our cloud titan customers. Clearly, it\u2019s in the first innings. We\u2019re just beginning. So very much like cloud networking 10 years ago, we see AI as an additional use case. It is a very, very small portion of our use cases so far. So a lot of upside ahead. Paul Silverstein : Is it possible to quantify, Jayshree? Jayshree Ullal : Too early to quantify. It\u2019s not material. Paul Silverstein : Okay, I appreciate. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter as well. I guess, maybe this is for Anshul, building on the last two questions. Is that \u2013 as you look at kind of adding up the Meta and Microsoft contribution and you compare that to 46% total cloud titans, your other cloud titan contribution is still pretty small. So Anshul, when you\u2019re engaging with other cloud opportunities, maybe you can unpack that a little bit. What\u2019s opening up the opportunities for you? Is it AI or is it something else that you\u2019re starting to see? And how do we start to think about that as an incremental growth driver? Anshul Sadana : Sure, Aaron. First of all, we are proud of our achievement for the first two M and M with the contributions there. On the other titans, we have been engaged fairly well with them. That business is also growing, but it pales in comparison to Microsoft and Meta, but it is not insignificant compared to other opportunities in the market. And we continue to chase those. Those partnerships are very, very strong as well. At some point in the future, if the opportunities materialize, any of these customers decide to go big in the market and buy switches from the industry like us, I think we will perform very well. We start to wait out and get to that opportunity. It\u2019s not clear at say yet. Whether it\u2019s happening in a year or 2 or 3, I don\u2019t know. When it happens, we will be there. And we will do well in where we are today with them, which is essentially routing use cases or DCI use cases or WAN or edge. And we touched on this topic before, too. But if there were shift buying more from the outside, I think we will be ready. Aaron Rakers : Good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. Jayshree, and Ita and everyone, congratulations on great results. My question is, I think it was Ita made the comment of expect a deceleration in revenues as we progress throughout the same \u2013 throughout the year just to get to the 25% revenue growth. I want to make sure I heard that right because that would then also mean that even with very, very difficult year-over-year comps for revenues, you wouldn\u2019t expect them to go negative at all. And I guess when we look at that deceleration, it kind of seems like a steep decline to get to an average of 25%. So can you help me with my math there or the missing pieces? Or is it some conservatism? Or I\u2019m just kind of wondering, but it definitely doesn\u2019t seem like negative growth is in the works. Ita Brennan : Yes. No. No, we didn\u2019t talk about negative growth. If you look at the trend last year, you\u2019ll see it really accelerated post Q1, right? So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a much stronger growth rate year-over-year with our Q1 guide, then you will move through the year. So I think after Q1, it\u2019s better to start to look at it as a quarter-by-quarter \u2013 on a quarter-by-quarter basis and kind of earlier revenues quarter-by-quarter. There is certainly no kind of negative growth in that. I think you\u2019ll get a better answer if you kind of just grow kind of quarter-over-quarter from there on out. Q1 was a much lower revenue number last year back on the trend. Jim Suva : Great. Thank you for the details and congratulations and Happy Valentine\u2019s to all of you. Ita Brennan : Thank you, Jim. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Jim. This is all about comps, isn\u2019t it? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results as well. I guess, I had a quick one, which is... Jayshree Ullal : Can you speak louder? Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hopefully, you can hear me now. Is this better? Can you hear me now? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, much better. Thank you. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. So I was just going to ask you on your large cloud customer, Meta, and their recent announcement around architecture changes related to data centers and trying to run AI workloads and non-AI workloads together on the same data centers and some of those related announcements if you\u2019ve been able to dissect that and sort of have any thoughts about how that might impact their spending in relation to switching and routing equipment, particularly as it relates to your portfolio. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So Samik, I\u2019ll say some few words and obviously, Anshul can get into detail. We don\u2019t foresee any major architectural changes in the build-out of the AI clusters. Clearly, we continue to work with them on the front end of the network. And on the back end, these have been based on the flagship 7800 spine, the AI spine, where you can have a distributed AID for it can be going straight into the spine. And when you have the hundreds and thousands of GPUs, you need a lossless fabric that has all of the congestion control and bandwidth management required. So in the short-term, no major change in architecture. In the long-term, as these customers look for efficiency, we look for these AI fabrics to get larger or more distributed, but there will naturally be an evolution as the market grows, but no dramatic shift or change, just more of the same. Anshul, say few words? Anshul Sadana : Samik, just keep in mind, Meta slowed down spending a few years ago, right? So there is some catching up to do to sort of the spend that got missed out. So you have to sort of go back what\u2019s an average it out to understand the trend. And second, Jayshree mentioned from what we know so far, we don\u2019t believe there is any change in the networking spend. The CapEx optimization they are discussing are either tied to how the buildings are built, facilities or letting go of nights to our projects. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi. I want to ask about the other part that no one is asking about, the non-cloud titans. So if I back out cloud titans, non-cloud grew 14.6%. And the question is, first of all, on last year, did you allocate components to cloud titans? And was this area more pressured than cloud titans when it comes to allocation? So if that\u2019s the case \u2013 or what is the answer about what happens this year, this coming year or this year on the non-cloud titan portion? What drives it to accelerate from the 14.5% growth of last year? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Got it, Tal. So first of all, absolutely not. We don\u2019t do any allocation. It\u2019s very much a first in, first out algorithm. And many of the cloud titans clearly were the first in, so therefore, they are the first out. Our enterprise customers and the momentum as the demand is very high, and we fully expect that they will get their turn in this year, in 2023. But given how constrained we were in supply, this is the way it worked out in terms of revenue. Tal Liani : Is there \u2013 what are the underlying driver for growth acceleration, the driver \u2013 outside of components, better component supplies, what are the underlying growth drivers for 2023 versus 2022? Jayshree Ullal : I think they are very similar. You heard me talk about some of the enterprise momentum. Our customers are really looking for consolidation of their data centers in terms of a better automation, better telemetry, better consolidation of their operational advantages in the data center. Campus is a huge use case. Routing and bringing all of the routing features that we\u2019ve been working on for over 5 years to bear has been a third one. Observability and securities, another use case, our telemetry with CloudVision. So very similar themes to 2022 that we\u2019re seeing in \u201823. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Fahad Najam : Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of clarifications. The cognitive adjacencies that were, I think, 14% of revenue is it fair to assume it\u2019s fairly split evenly between CapEx switching and routing? Jayshree Ullal : Sorry, Fahad, can you repeat the question? I couldn\u2019t hear. Fahad Najam : The cognitive adjacency to revenue that you gave, I think it was 14% of revenue, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And I\u2019m just wondering, is the split even between campus and routing? Jayshree Ullal : Approximately, both of them were large contributors. So I don\u2019t have the exact percentages, but we think campus over time will become larger. But at the moment, I would say it\u2019s 6 or 1.5 a dozen of the other. Fahad Najam : Got it. For my question, how should we be thinking about \u2013 with AI and machine learning becoming more pervasive and cloud titan architectures and this prospective displacement of InfiniBand with Ethernet, how should we be thinking about the TAM opportunity? Because how big does this InfiniBand replacement opportunity, so to speak? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I think the InfiniBand TAM today has a very \u2013 we use HPC $1 billion to $1.5 billion TAM. And it didn\u2019t address AI workloads. I think the advent of this new application is going to open up the whole AI, networking and fabric TAM to much greater than InfiniBand. So not only do we have an opportunity to replace InfiniBand, but we have a greenfield opportunity for new AI fabrics and clusters. So it\u2019s both, not just a legacy InfiniBand opportunity. Fahad Najam : So roughly how big do you think the opportunity is? Jayshree Ullal : I don\u2019t think \u2013 there have been some market studies on this. Some people say $2 billion a year, some people say $4 billion, some say it\u2019s going to $8 billion. So I think it\u2019s still too early to call. It depends on how quickly the adoption of AI fabric happens in all of our large customers. Fahad Najam : Thank you. Appreciate the answers. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Fahad. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Pierre Ferragu : Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to catch up on what you said, Jayshree, about like routing \u2013 edge routing and gearing. And this opportunity still comes back as an interesting and intriguing area. And so my question would be, anything you can give us in terms of sizing, how significant it is today? And then beyond that, could you give us a sense of how you understand like the long-term market dynamics in there? So it\u2019s a market where all the legacy routing players are very strong, have like a very strong existing ecosystem. And I\u2019m still not exactly clear on what market dynamics create the opportunity for Arista and how we should think about it in the long run. Like is there an opportunity to replace incumbents in peering \u2013 in large peering markets? And if that\u2019s the case, how does that work? Is that like operators buying from you? Is that coming from other types of clients, like cloud players? So what \u2013 how does the opportunity shape up over time? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Anshul, I\u2019d love your perspective on it. Let me kick it off. We think the router market is much bigger than the routing market. The router market is the more legacy market that\u2019s being served by a number of traditional industry experts for 20 years and mostly servicing the service provider market. And that\u2019s a very traditional market that Arista has been participating some in, but we don\u2019t expect to be a major player in traditional service providers. However, we\u2019ve added so much routing features. Routing is now part of our switching system. It\u2019s sometimes hard to separate it. It\u2019s the same hardware, different software. If you just look at the last year, we\u2019ve added Ethernet OEM capability, VPLS, timing with SyncE, EVPN, MPLS gateway and multi-cap VPN, edge services, routing scale, you heard Anshul talk about, that can go over 4 million routes. So our portfolio is really transitioning to supporting 400-gig deployments, and routing in the cloud scale is something we are very successful in. So on one hand, we\u2019re not super successful in the traditional service providers. On the other hand, we are hugely successful in the cloud. And then in between, we are finding ourselves moderately successful in a lot of the enterprise and specialty cloud providers. Anshul, you want to add a few words? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Period of another angle here, if you look at how we started to enter this market through some of the CDN companies like Netflix and Spotify, these companies have an SDN approach to edge. It\u2019s a scale-out architecture. You can take a simple router from Arista and scale it out, and the automation and the SDK we provide allows our customers to do that, which is why we do very well in these use cases versus the legacy full-feature traditional router. And our cloud customers, the titan, the Tier 2 cloud, the providers, all like these architectures. Pierre Ferragu : Great. Thanks for your answers. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Pierre. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Genovese : Great. Thanks so much. I guess just sort of theoretically in an AI data center, I mean let\u2019s just \u2013 current way of doing chat versus an AI chat, can you give us some sense of the switching intensity increase in the new use case with AI? Is there a multiplier to put on the switching or the networking to think about the higher amount of content and spend for AIs? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Michael, I\u2019ll take this one. It\u2019s way hard to generalize. It must have a single number, but AI equals so much more. But I\u2019ll give you an example of something that Andy talked about at the last Analyst Day. And if you look at the recent pattern, which Meta published some papers about some of the time, the GPOs were sitting idle because they were waiting for the [indiscernible] to come back. So networking becomes the bottleneck and [indiscernible] you can add more bandwidth then you essentially become non-blocking. You can do your job can run faster and you can use your GPUs in a much more efficient manner. So a rough order of magnitude with GPU clusters need about 3x more bandwidth than a traditional compute network today. But again, that\u2019s a generalization, doesn\u2019t apply to every use case. But if you need a single number, that\u2019s the one I would use. Michael Genovese : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 on supply chain, what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of did it loosen faster than you were expecting in Q4 and that was part of the upside or just how you\u2019re looking at conditions kind of improving throughout the year and maybe just that kind of release to gross margins as we think about throughout the year and kind of the overhead of the inventory currently. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Meta. I\u2019ll comment on it and Anshul, you don\u2019t have a few words, too. Look, supply chain hasn\u2019t eased up enough for us. Maybe we have more demand than others, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re feeling it more. But having said that, our Q4 numbers would have been even better if supply chain had eased. And our Q1 gross margin is a reflection that supply chain is still an overhead on our cost, right? We expect Q1 to be the absolute worst. We\u2019re going to improve thereafter every other quarter. So supply chain is going to be using in the back half of \u201823. And as you know, at the Analyst Day, we gave a guide of \u2013 Ita, we said 61 to 63 for the year? Ita Brennan : Yes. Jayshree Ullal : So we fully intend to improve our gross margins every quarter thereafter after, potentially hitting a low in Q1, which is an indication of supply chain improving. But at the same time, remember, another huge factor in our contribution to gross margins is the healthy cloud titan mix. We\u2019d like to keep it healthy and ease supply chain, and that will give us some improvements. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Meta. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. And congrats on super quarter. I wanted to push a little bit more on the supply chain issue that \u2013 just talking about. I get the point that the gross margins are the worst in the first quarter, but when do you think the balance between availability and your backlog starts to come into balance so that you can actually ship what orders come in and the duration on your backlog, which I know you don\u2019t talk about, but conceptually starts to come in line so that we\u2019re back to a fairly normal book and ship environment? Jayshree Ullal : Paul, I\u2019ll let Ita answer this, but I wouldn\u2019t call our current environment approaching normality for some time. So we hope it will be second half that the supply and the demand catch up. But I hope it catches up because we improve our supply, not that demand goes down. So we wanted to also improve for the right reasons. Ita Brennan : Alex, I think the goal, obviously, is to improve \u2013 have supply improve and then improve manufacturing and improve efficiencies, and we will be working on that as we go through the year. I don\u2019t know what the final normal will be. We will have to see. I think just given everything that we\u2019ve been through from a supply chain perspective, it\u2019s probably \u2013 maybe there is a little bit more lead time visibility that will end up in the system at the end, but we will have to see. Jayshree Ullal : I think what we can safely say is we are getting comfortable that lead times will improve throughout the year. Will we get to normal lead times? I think that will still take time because we\u2019ve got to work through our demand. Alex Henderson : If I could just one clarification. Did you say you had a decommitted in the fourth quarter? I thought I heard that in the presentation. Thanks. Ita Brennan : No. Decommits on the supply side. I mean. We\u2019ve had a some thousand starts on the supply side, for sure, if that\u2019s the question. Jayshree Ullal : [indiscernible]. It had to do with our supply constraints. Component vendors are constantly decommitting. Alex Henderson : Okay, thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Niknam : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on the question on macro that was asked earlier. Are there any regions, verticals where you\u2019ve seen any maybe greater-than-usual slowness in ordering because of macro? And then maybe if I can sneak one in for Ita. On the free cash flow trajectory, broadly speaking, just curious if there is any broad color you can provide around working capital and primarily asking around inventory and whether that\u2019s still a drag or whether you expect to maybe convert some more of that to cash this year? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll take the cash piece of it first. Yes, I\u2019m not sure that we start to see it kind of come down just yet. I think probably, at least for the first half, we will probably still be building inventory. I mean we do have some kind of key components that are still long lead time. And we wanted to build buffers, so we will continue to do that. And then hopefully, in the second half, it\u2019s probably at least kind of flattened out. But again, we will update that as we go quarter-by-quarter. But I think there is definitely a piece that\u2019s still going to be a long lead time that will kind of hold inventory a little bit higher than what we might like for the time being. Jayshree Ullal : And your question on macro, like I said before, we will call it when we see it. We are not seeing anything major and significant yet. And customers are watching, we are watching, and no major trend I can point to. Matt Niknam : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. Just kind of a two-parter on the campus business. First, I think you guys have talked about doing a little bit better in the wireless LAN area. So, curious if you think that having a better wired and wireless portfolio kind of accelerates the share gains potential in that area. So, was that something that was maybe holding back some wins that could help in the future? And then secondly, I think at the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about SD-WAN. I am just curious if you can give us an update on when you might start to see another leg to the campus strategy in what\u2019s a pretty high-growth vertical. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. So, Tim, on the wired and wireless, we are obviously much stronger on wired because there is a very natural affinity to the Arista EOS stack. So \u2013 and we also have a full portfolio, 1RU, 2RU, all the way to a chassis with built-in encryption. No other company, maybe except one, has that. So, we are very competitive there. On the wireless, we are sort of the new kid on the block. And we have \u2013 as I said, if you just look at our campus entry, we are a new kid on the block. This is our third year. So, we I think are going from being a toddler to an adult now here very soon. So, we believe we have a strong portfolio also differentiated by CloudVision, both wired/wireless coming into the same spine architecture that we articulate and designed for the data center. So, we feel very, very good about our portfolio being strong. I think more of our efforts will go into go-to-market and reaching these customers because much of what we have done to-date is, if you will, low-hanging fruit with our familiar customers and our existing base. Tim Long : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and nice finish for the year, ladies. A couple of questions for me. First of all, for you, Ita, on the cash. I just want to piggyback on some of the previous question on the account receivables. Clearly, they have ballooned here on the year. Are the cash payment terms of the cloud guys any different than a normal enterprise? And what percent of this account receivables do you think you can recoup in the year? And then for you, Jayshree, on campus, clearly, supply chain is a little bit of a hurdle there. Cisco has taken action to redesign some of its solutions to products and components that are much more readily available. Is that not a path for you? And if it is, what can you do on that front to alleviate the supply and more easily address demand? Ita Brennan : Maybe I will take the cash one first. I mean a lot of the DSO growth is really around those service renewals that we saw at the back end of the quarter. If you think about those and how they flowed, they generate almost no revenue. But obviously, they are in AR, they are multiyear, so it causes the AR to spike. We will collect kind of a lot of that in Q1. Good healthy am or balance target, I think into Q1. There is no change in aging or anything else. It\u2019s really just the timing of those service renewals and the fact that they end up in AR at the end of the quarter. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So, Ittai, thank you for wishes, by the way and Happy Valentine\u2019s Day. We listened to you and made sure the earnings call was not on Valentine\u2019s Day. To your question, absolutely, we have our choice of vendors and redesigns. Redesigns take time, and qualifying them with our customer takes even longer. So, we have chosen multi-pronged approach, where we do have redesigns that we can invoke, but we are also improving our relationship and partnership with our supply chain vendors. Anshul, your team has been working on that. I think your vendor this has gone from tens to hundreds, if I remember right. Anshul Sadana : That\u2019s right, Jayshree. This is the first time we are close to almost 100 suppliers where we talk to them directly. Even if we don\u2019t buy the components from them, we control the relationship and the technology and the roadmap... Jayshree Ullal : So, to answer your question in the campus specifically, both with redesigns and with our supplier partnerships, we fully expect to come back and not fall short of our numbers in \u201823. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Thanks. Good luck. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon everyone. I also wanted to piggyback a little bit on campus. Jayshree, could you talk a little bit about how customers are responding as they are facing the increase in lead times or the lead times overall? It\u2019s better market share opportunity. Any risk that that shares perishable? Do they choose to opt to renew with who they have? And then you talked a little bit about go-to-market on campus. What are you doing differently, or what are your thoughts on where that goes from here? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, those are very good questions, Ben. I would say, currently, we are gaining share because others are messing up. Whether it\u2019s changing to a software model or not able to supply, Arista has been the benefactor of that. They are still small numbers, obviously. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine that we are at risk of losing share when we have such small share. Our goal is to grow share at the moment. What was your second question or the second part of that question? Ben Bollin : Go-to-market strategy. Jayshree Ullal : Oh, what is the go-to-market. Well, in the near-term, our go-to-market has very much been to target our 9,000 cumulative customers. But we are building a mid-market strategy. We are going to work closely with channel partners. Those things take time. So, I would say our initial go-to-market is our enterprise customers. And over time, we will have a more mid-market strategy. Ben Bollin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Fish : Happy Valentine\u2019s Day, ladies. Great quarter. Just going back to your commentary on cloud titans being kind of between \u201821 and \u201822 levels just given the overall growth, it does suggest a bit of an acceleration for everybody else. I guess what\u2019s driving that confidence? Is it just mainly what\u2019s in backlog? Is it additional hyperscaler wins, including with AI or enterprise share gains or something else? And then, Ita, just for you as a follow-up on the cash flow, is there a way to think about kind of a normalized cash flow level or where you expect inventory turns to get to by the end of the year? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yes. Maybe I will take that one first, Jim. I am not quite ready yet to call kind of a turns number for the end of the year. I think inventory dollars probably grow, certainly through the first half. And then hopefully, we can flatten out from there. We will look for optimization, but there is still a fair amount of kind of long lead time items that we need to kind of carry and buffer. So, I will come back to you as we kind of go through the year. But I think certainly for the first half, you should be looking for inventory to probably continue to grow on an absolute dollar basis. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, James, for the wishes. I think in one word, I would say momentum. Our enterprise customers are really looking for an alternative to what they have got. There is a lot of fatigue in the system. And what\u2019s driving my optimism, where there is backlog from prior demand or present demand, is they are really hungry, and Arista presents that alternative. Liz Stine : Next question operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Vogt : Great. Thank you everyone for taking my call. I just want to pivot back to Meta for a second. And so in addition to the new architecture that they have been talking about, and I think Anshul addressed it, the company also talked about potentially using more colocation and maybe other public company assets to kind of meet its capital intensity needs going forward. Would just love to kind of get your thoughts on how that impacts your spending going \u2013 they are spending on Arista gear going forward. And then just going also on the titan mix percentages, if the rest of the business is growing at the rates that we think it\u2019s going to grow in 2023 to end up somewhere between the \u201821 and \u201822 level, does that suggest that the titans business in total grows kind of in the low teens in \u201823 off of triple-digit growth in \u201822? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : And just to answer that one, it is definitely not going to be triple-digit in \u201823. We can say that with certainty. That was a beautiful year and one for the history books. Anshul, you want to take the rest? Anshul Sadana : Sure. On the Meta question, David, experience and so on, I think the high-level message to us is similar around their business efficiently as efficiently as possible and optimize. So, projects are nice to have. Obviously, those are getting cut back. And as you mentioned, in base like colos and so on, you don\u2019t need a very large architecture to start with. If you only have a 3-megawatt side, as an example, you have a smaller cluster size. But our products already fit very well in all of these use cases. So, we don\u2019t believe there is any significant impact to networking from what we can tell today in the near-term, right. We don\u2019t have visibility, that\u2019s many, many years out today. But the message we have been given is basically no big impact to networking as far as we are concerned. David Vogt : Great. Liz Stine : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Blakey : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I have a question back on the F&E line financials in enterprise, the drivers that I think maybe Ita was getting at many questions ago. But I was wondering how much like rip-and-replace type of wins are kind of like starting to rear into here this \u2013 implied, in my mind anyway, an acceleration in the growth in the F&E line. And specifically, the new cloud test product that you launched at the end of last year, if that\u2019s kind of more of a 2023 driver and again, that kind of rip-and-replace type of wins, which is a large opportunity. And enterprise is more of a \u201823 driver or if it\u2019s more \u201824. And then maybe just quick for Ita. As enterprise mix is up, just remind us what the gross margin and operating margin impact should be for mixing more towards enterprise, that would be helpful. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Maybe I will take that one quickly first. I mean I think the gross margins, we have kind of talked about it, improving as we go through the year, and kind of the mix is obviously part of that. Operating margin is pretty neutral actually between cloud versus the rest. So, I don\u2019t know that there is any big driver there. Jayshree Ullal : No. We have much lower sales and marketing on the cloud, more technically driven. So, it\u2019s not the same. Going back to your rip-and-replace for financial, I think it F&E means financials and enterprise, just to clarify. Tom Blakey : Yes. Exactly. I am just talking specifically about the new cloud test product where you can emulate an existing network and then just kind of plug and play the Arista product over an existing install. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So, one of the common spreads we are seeing in enterprise and financials is that they want \u2013 that nobody is getting more staff to do their job. So, they want more tools to automate and bring their SecOps, DevOps, NetOps, all of their operations together. And this is where the Arista introduction of our continuous integration, continuous design and continuous test has really been strategic because not only do you have to give them a tool for automation, but you also have to work with them and train and teach them how to deploy it. So, these end up not necessarily being rip-and-replace, but sort of a gradual evolution where they will identify the first use case of first data center that they will do this on, and then it will expand \u2013 land and expand to more use cases. So, most enterprises are not a rip-and-replace, but it\u2019s a use case that we begin with and then gradually evolve to go into a rip-and-replace as their depreciation gets completed on the existing legacy year. So, it\u2019s a multiyear type of deployment, and it usually begins with a couple of use cases. Tom Blakey : Thank you, Jayshree. Liz Stine : Thanks Tom. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Thanks for fitting me in and Happy Valentine\u2019s. On the Meta front, I am just curious, they have talked about adopting more of a modular kind of scalable architecture. I am wondering if that changes any of the buying behavior on the purchasing patterns. Does that smooth out some of the purchasing from the likes of a Meta? And then secondly, Ita, on the balance sheet with your purchase commitments, do you have control over how much inventory you take on, or as the inventory becomes available, do you get \u2013 do you take it in, in which case might we see your inventory balloon if more of the inventory becomes available? Ita Brennan : Yes. No, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t like balloon as a word. I mean there are certain suppliers where lead times are [Technical Difficulty] inventory. So, we will continue to do that. I think on the purchase commitment, we talked about this a little bit at the Analyst Day as well. I mean as lead times start to move around, obviously, we will work with the contract on those take [ph]. That\u2019s why, I mean over time, that number should come down as aging to lead time with the contract manufacturers. Anshul Sadana : Okay. And on the Meta question, the Meta architecture already is quite modular with \u2013 you talked about design for development than terabits 7388. It can go up to 256 ECMP, 256 net bus. The cluster sizes are smaller, they don\u2019t need 256. Maybe they can start with 16 or 32. So, we already built into the model today. I don\u2019t believe it has any impact on us. Same thing on the 7800 AI spine, they can add a number of line cards based on the number of GPUs or RACs that they are connected to. So, we are very, very efficient already and this fits very well in their model. Liz Stine : Thank you Erik. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Great. Just for me in two quick ones. First one is for Ita. Can we just talk about the benefits of pricing from some of the price increases that you guys have put through to the portfolio and the effect it had on gross margins? And then the second question is for Jayshree. Jayshree, you have given us kind of a ballpark visibility, I guess some kind of quantification in the number of months that you see visibility with some of your biggest customers. Could you give us an update on that same type of visibility? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think on the pricing piece of it, I mean for sure, we are getting some benefit from the pricing. But as time goes on, it starts in \u2013 the dynamic environment, it starts to be harder to track that kind of when it gets lost in the overall growth in the business. But we did check, and there is definitely some uptick for pricing there. It\u2019s just not something that we are kind of tracking on an ongoing basis. Jayshree Ullal : And in terms of visibility, Sami, in the past, we have seen as much as a year\u2019s visibility. If I were to guess, I think as the lead times improve, that visibility will reduce. Maybe it\u2019s down to three quarters now. And the visibility was very much tied to planning cycles. And when the planning cycles were longer than a year because our lead times were longer than a year, then that \u2013 then we got greater visibility. Liz Stine : Thank you, Sami. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. George Notter : Hi there. I am curious about why you guys think you should take share from InfiniBand going forward in AI and HPC environments. I am just curious about what the logic is there. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. There is two big reasons. I think in the past, Ethernet was always striking in terms of performance and bandwidth to InfiniBand. Today, as we start talking about 400, 800, 1.2 terabits, the options on Ethernet are much greater and very cost-effective than anybody is there. The other is, I think historically, InfiniBand has been more for high-performance compute use cases. We are very bullish on the AI workloads and its impact on Ethernet, where we don\u2019t believe InfiniBand has any particular advantage and, in fact Ethernet does. Liz Stine : Thank you, George. We have time for one last question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking. I wanted to maybe dig a little bit into the campus business, particularly whether or not that unit has been more constrained, and therefore, recovery bounces back. And ultimately, wondering if really an increase in campus in the mix, I know you gave us a $750 million target by \u201825 million. Wondering if that\u2019s considered a headwind to gross margin or whether it\u2019s more about the market verticals that affects your margins? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No headwind to gross margin. Our campus business has good gross margins. I just \u2013 as we said, on the product side, I feel very good that the campus can execute. On the go-to-market side, we have more work. So, I am giving our self some optionality that if we do the work really well, we could exceed the $750 million. And if we can\u2019t, then that will be the more likely number. Liz Stine : Great. Thanks Simon. This concludes the Arista Networks\u2019 fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2023. If you would like a copy of this release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlook for 2023 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization, and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz, and happy Monday, everyone, and a happy month of May. We delivered revenues of 1.35 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 13.5% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 60.3% was influenced by supply chain overheads and cloud titan concentration. We expect our gross margins to improve every quarter throughout this year. International contribution registered at 17.5% with the Americas strong at 82.5% for the quarter. While we will shift to reporting our vertical segments on an annual basis, I would like to share some overall trends we\u2019re seeing. We do expect cloud titans will moderate compared to our 2022 triple digit growth, while enterprise is likely to be more steady state. It is evident that our lead times are improving. Our visibility to customer forecast therefore are now beyond six months or now below six months, I should say, and they are shrinking. Despite macro uncertainty, we endorsed consensus of 26% annual growth to approximately 5.5 billion revenue in 2023. On the product side, we made many exciting Q1 announcements. At OFC 2023, we introduced our vision for Linear Drive Optics for intra and intra-datacenter connectivity at 800 gig and beyond. This was a highlight for both Arista and the optical industry at large, delivering the promise of low power and improved price performance for demanding AI workloads. Speaking of AI, the mandate to avoid idle states in expensive and large AI processor clusters requires that specialized AI network. Key characteristics include wire rate and lossless delivery of large and synchronized bursts of data at 400 to 800 gig speeds. Today, the combination of RDMA mix, RDMA stands for remote direct memory access; and ROCE, which is RDMA over converged Ethernet along with the switches, allows Ethernet to become that predictable transport network. Ethernet of course brings familiarity, great economics, massive install base, standards with industry-wide interoperability, and many merchant silicon options. This is supporting compute and data intensive workloads based on generative AI, inference, and large language model training applications. Arista's cloud customers are resonating with our AI and switching strategy for platforms. Presently, we are in the midst of trials leading to production deployments this year in 2023. We expect AI networking to become meaningful throughout the years and through the decade ahead. In Q1 2023, Arista also formalized our new entry into the wide area network with our WAN routing system. Our enterprise class routing platform is based on carrier and cloud neutral transit with CloudVision Pathfinder Service. Not surprisingly, we support Arista's EOS operating system stack, delivering that operational model for network as a service and wide area as a service. We are targeting mission critical enterprises where [high-volume] [ph] and encrypted traffic matter in a modern WAN. Arista has partnered with Equinix to develop and deploy the WAN routing system and WAN routing will be included as part of our network adjacency category. In the non-cloud category, we have registered a solid number of million dollar customers, which is a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise and campus throughout the past year. Let me illustrate with a few customer wins. The first used case is an international government win. The customer's objective was to detect illegal activities such as money laundering, terrorism, scams, and other criminal behavior in real time by collecting and analyzing data. Arista's data-driven AI clusters are optimizes network assurance for mission critical AI and ML workloads. Using advanced features like microburst and fan in congestion management, ultra deep packet buffer memory with latency analyzer provides real time telemetry, visibility, automation, and dynamic controls for their AI and ML data centers all based on open standards Ethernet. Our second win continues on the international theme and highlights our ever growing strength in the education vertical, where Arista's proposal for Edge Campus platforms ranging from power over Ethernet switches, wireless access points, and automation was a decision factor. We leveraged [CloudVision Q] [ph], cognitive unified edge, coupled with Arista validated designs as an automation framework across multiple distributed locations bringing unmatched flow visibility. The next win is in the U.S. Financial sector. This customer had grown organic and inorganically through acquisitions and is looking to modernize their entire infrastructure, moving their data closer to the cloud to enable a hybrid cloud architecture. This design included multiple greenfield data centers, hosted in Equinix, requiring active-active 400 gigabit Ethernet fine, securely encrypted data center interconnect and Internet connectivity at each site. For a smooth upgrade in their campus environment without disruption to their end users, Arista's SSU or smart systems upgrade feature played a prominent role. We also help them build a digital twin of their environment modeling their designs for automation. The next customer highlights healthcare as a critical win for network monitoring and security analysis tools at their remote data center facilities. This holistic view of Port Mirroring sessions for traffic analysis from all their remote data centers was a superior approach. Arista\u2019s centralized DMS, DANZ Monitoring Fabric was better than disparate and expensive tools at each remote location. A final customer win was looking for real-time in-house video streaming and editing capabilities. Video would be stored on their storage arrays, which could be connected at 100 gigabit Ethernet and then accessed and rendered by the clients, be they PCs or Max with 25 gigabit Ethernet. Arista\u2019s core strength in the media vertical comes from its deep buffer virtual output queuing architecture with our R3 platforms. The simplicity, scalability, and flexibility aligns this \u2013 shows this elegant design and highlights our strength in the media and entertainment vertical. So, as you can see, this is a recurring theme in all our customer wins, where Arista is deploying innovative solutions based on a consistent architecture, allowing each and every customer to modernize their network with the power of our platform. And with that, I'd like to hand to Ita, our CFO for financial metrics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance Q2 2023 is based on non-GAAP, excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q1 were 1.351 billion, up 54% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of 1.275 billion to 1.325 billion. We continue to experience improvements in component supply in the quarter, supporting more consistent levels of manufacturing output and some improvements in lead time. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 13.5% of revenues for the first quarter, down from 15.8% in Q4. It's largely reflected accelerated growth in product revenues, while services and software continue to grow on a more consistent basis. International revenues for the quarter came in at 236 million or 17.5% of total revenue, down from 23.5% last quarter. This quarter report a reduction, largely reflected on unusually high contribution from our EMEA and region customers in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to see outsized growth in the U.S. largely due to ongoing domestic strength of our cloud type and customer. Overall gross margin in Q1 was 60.3% in-line with our guidance of approximately 60%. We continue to recognize incremental supply chain costs in the period, combined with the healthy cloud mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were 257.5 million or 19.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at 235.3 million. R&D spending came in at 164.8 million or 12.2% of revenue, up from 153.2 million last quarter. This primarily reflected increased headcount and new product introduction cost in the period. Sales and marketing expense was 75.9 million or 5.6% of revenue, compared to 67.4 million last quarter with increased headcount costs and higher variable compensation expenses. Our G&A costs came in at 16.8 million or 1.2% of revenue consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was 556.8 million or 41.2% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable 17.7 million and our effective tax rate was 21.2%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of 452.5 million, a 33.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 315.6 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.43, up 70% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments ended the quarter at approximately 3.33 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased $82.3 million of our common stock at an average price of $111.9 per share. We've now repurchased $825.5 million or 7.8 million shares at an average price of $106 per share under our current billion dollars board authorization. This leaves 174.5 million available to repurchase in future quarters. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, stock price, and other factors. Now turning to operating cash flow for the first quarter. We generated approximately [275 million] [ph] of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance, partially offset by ongoing investments in working capital. DSOs committed 57 days down from 67 days in Q4, reflecting a strong collections quarter with good linearity of billings.  Inventory turns were 1.3x down from 1.6x last quarter. Inventory increased to 1.7 billion in the quarter, up from 1.3 billion in the prior period, reflecting the receipt of components from our purchase commitments and a slight increase in switch related finished goods. Our purchase commitment at the end of the quarter were 2.9 billion, down from 3.7 billion at the end of Q4. We expect this number to continue to decline in future quarters as component lead times improve and we work to optimize our supply positions. Our total deferred revenue balance was 1.092 billion, up from 104 billion in Q4. The majority of the deferred revenue balance and services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenue balance was flat to last quarter. Accounts payable days were 55 days, up from 43 days in Q4 protecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 5.6 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. As we move through 2023, we expect to resolve the final [indiscernible] the supply chain, allowing for more consistent manufacturing output and improving lead times to our customers. We do however expect these reduced lead times to also result in reduced visibility. The customers no longer needing to make purchase decisions so far in advance of deployment. In addition, we expect some moderation in customer spending, especially with our cloud titan customers following year of accelerated demand in 2022. All of that being said, we believe customer engagements and current deployments across business support the current consensus revenue growth rate for 2023 of approximately 26%. In terms of quarterly trends, you should expect moderating year-over-year growth as the year progresses with more difficult prior year comps. On the gross margin front, beginning in Q2, we expect to see some steady improvement as we consume fewer broker parts and have the opportunity to optimize manufacturing output, while maintaining a healthy contribution from our cloud customers. Now, turning to spending and investments, we continue to monitor the overall maximum environment carefully will prioritize our investments as we move through the year. This would include a focus on targeted hires and R&D and go to market as the team sees the opportunity to acquire talent. On the cash front, I will continue to focus on supply chain and working capital optimization. We should expect some continued growth in inventory on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we receive components from our purchase commitments. With all of this in the backdrop, our guidance of the second quarter is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non- recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately 1.35 billion to 1.40 billion; gross margin of approximately 61%, operating margin at approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 317 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious, kind of the commentary around the hyperscale cloud as component lead times shrink, how would you characterize if at all, you know the visibility in that vertical? And specifically how maybe that's evolved or changed relative to let's say the commentary or the thoughts a quarter ago? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Hey, Aaron. I'll kick it off, and maybe Anshul can help me. As you know, historically visibility with the cloud titans issue, if you take out \u2013 if you subtract the last two years, which were largely supply chain related, was typically two quarters, right? And for a period of time last year and the year before, we were starting to get four quarters of visibility. As our lead times are improving, our visibility is also shrinking, especially with that segment because they can make decisions closer to our lead times. So, I would say our visibility has reduced from last year to this year by two quarters and is roughly six months. Liz Stine : Thank you, Aaron. We can go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Your line is open. Antoine Chkaiban : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. So, at the CMZ, I think you provided an AI intensive network stand of 2 billion, 3 billion in the next few years. And during last earnings, [Broadcom] [ph] said that their Ethernet switch chips deployed in AI was well over 200 million in 2022 and did forecast that this could grow to well over 800 million in 2023. So, I imagine that that would correspond to 4 billion or 5 billion in revenues. This is therefore already well above the [TAM] [ph] that you estimated. Am I missing anything or did the TAM expand considerably more than you are anticipating at the CMD? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Hi, this is Anshul. As you know, there's a lot of talk about AI and it's a very exciting topic in many ways. First, you have to separate out numbers that Broadcom's giving you versus where our customers will deploy systems, right? There's an offset of when they ship chips versus when they can ship systems and often by a quarter sometimes [indiscernible] as long as a year, right, given the lead times and so on that are going on in the market. Second, I think AI is still in its infancy. I don't think we know really how big it will be. It's clearly on a very good trajectory to keep on growing. And there is a great opportunity for us for sure and we're doing very well with some of our top customers as Jayshree talked about in the primary script as well. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And just to add to what Anshul said, our forecast of 2 billion to 3 billion is more in the 2025 arena. Market analysts are already showing larger numbers than that, 2025 to 2027 arena. I think market analysts are already projecting it's double that. And certainly Broadcom is enthusiastically looking at their chip deployments. But again, as Anshul alluded, by the time Broadcom has a chip, the chip gets built into a system by us, and then the system gets deployed by our cloud customers. It can be 1 to 2 years. Antoine Chkaiban : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind, can we just dive in \u2013 dig a bit deeper into the inventory number, I think getting a few questions on that. Obviously, a material step-up in the inventory in the quarter, particularly as you mentioned lead times for your products in now six months, do we sort of conclude that your lead times will take a step function down if you have this much inventory at this point? And a fleet, if your visibility into demand is starting to come in a bit, why, sort of maybe help me about why the inventory continues to, sort of move up higher from here rather than sort of start to come down in-line with your visibility into demand? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Hi, Samik. This is Ita. When you think about the purchase commitments that we have and that we made some time ago, right? We're going to have to continue to work through those as we go through the rest of this year, particularly on some key components there were long lead times We had to place commitment for, kind of this year well earlier last year in order to secure those that supply. So, those components will continue to come into inventory and obviously they'll go out of inventory, as well as we build products, etcetera. So, we have a healthy deployment pipeline in front of us on the system side, but we are still going to gather components based on when those purchase commitments were made on the timing of those purchase commitments. So, if you look at the total of inventory plus purchase commitments, it came down in excess of 400 million this quarter. We will continue to, kind of work that down over time, but you will see the shift from purchase commitments into inventory parts and then obviously we'll sell that inventory. Jayshree Ullal : And Samik just to add to, you know, we're not managing the business as just in time inventory. As Ita said, we have 72-week lead time still on many of our components even with the supply chain improvements. So, we have to plan ahead, and if we want to get products to our customers in 6 to 12 months, assume a position on the inventory, and especially do so on common components where we feel confident that there is demand and we will continue to fulfill that demand this year and next year. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. I just want to follow-up, basically on the question on AI inventories and sort of revenue growth expectations for the second half. So, if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like you think given tough comps and sort of spending patterns from the Titan Group it\u2019s going to come down, bring revenue growth down to about 15% in the second half on a year-over-year basis. And yet, as you just mentioned, inventory still need to come down. So, how do we square that with, sort of the optimism in the marketplace that looks like you took your TAM up from about 40 billion to about 50 billion for data center and campus in the deck. I'm just trying to square the deceleration that you're talking about versus, sort of the expanded TAM that you're also, kind of highlighting in the deck? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Hey, David. I think first of all, the TAM we took up was for 2027, not Q3, Q4, 2023, just to be clear. And I think we continue to feel very optimistic about our long-term demand in enterprise cloud and AI. So, we shouldn't confuse the comps and difficulty of comparing Q3 2022 with Q3 2023 with our long-term demand and TAM. Both are valid statements. But as you know, the cloud is a volatile market and the titans will spend a lot one year and then spend a little less the other year as they're digesting it and deploying it. So, if you look across multiple years, we're going to have the strong demand and [do well] [ph]. Anshul Sadana : And David, this is very consistent with what we talked about last quarter, right? I mean we're \u2013 because of the comps and the pattern and the comps, we're going to grow quarter-by-quarter growing each quarter consecutively, but you will see that deceleration just because of how last years, kind of revenue trended as well. So, it doesn't say anything new here. In fact, we probably took up the overall number a little bit to get to the 26%. Jayshree Ullal : Right. We said 25 in November, now we're saying 26. David Vogt : Right. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe just zeroing in, kind of on the cloud titans vertical. You mentioned kind of reduced visibility, but just wanted to clarify, you know, had you seen any changes in orders or any push outs, kind of within the quarter of orders or \u2013 and within, kind of your near-term guidance of orders that you thought were going to take place that are maybe getting pushed out? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Meta, I'll let Anshul answer the question, but I would say, it's sort of a give and a take. Some things are getting pushed out and some are getting pulled, the silver lining is clearly AI. That's not getting pushed out, but some of the deployments of cloud regions are getting pushed out. Anshul, you want to add to that? Anshul Sadana : Meta, if I can add some more color to key areas that we've been tracking. I know we're only going to talk about AI. This [BPI market] [ph] is backbone, which is what started the 400-gig cycle in the first place. Those deployments are progressing as expected as well. So that part is steady state. And obviously, AI is growing compared to what we knew before. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sebastien Naji with William Blair. Your line is now open. Sebastien Naji : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just given this discussion around generative AI, maybe can you frame for us the advantages of Ethernet for building out these AI network fabrics and any metrics you might have that highlight these advantages versus something like InfiniBand? Jayshree Ullal : Sure. I think I said this before, but I think the Number 1 advantage of Ethernet is the fact that you're building a standard space, multi-vendor, highly interoperable network, where everything from troubleshooting to familiarity when you're connecting to the GPU clusters is very well known. So from a best-of-breed horizontal approach, Ethernet can win every time and [Ethernet technologies] [ph] generally struggle. Having said that, the vertical approach that InfiniBand adopted for high-performance computing can be applied to GPU clusters as well. So, I think it all depends on the customers' clusters and how large they are and the larger they become, the more it favors Ethernet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Tal Liani : Hi guys, thanks very much. I want to ask about non-cloud titans, the other part. Last year, it grew about 14.5% and it was supposed to grow \u2013 by your guidance, kind of supposed to grow much faster this year? What happened this quarter? And again, you don't provide exact numbers even qualitatively, what happens this quarter with non-cloud titan, how is demand shaping up when it comes to orders, I'm trying to neutralize the supply chain issue? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, good question. Enterprise demand is pretty strong and steady. In fact, I would go as far as saying the customer activity has been just as strong as last year. And some of these macro things we hear about, we are experiencing less of it perhaps because we are a small fish in a big ocean, right? So that said, obviously, our revenue has a high component to cloud titan concentration in Q1. So, the demand doesn't translate into direct revenue contribution in a specific quarter. But I think you will see a number far greater than the 15% through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng : Hey good afternoon. Thank you for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the endorsement of consensus at 26% year-over-year growth. I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're assuming as it relates to AI production deployments because you did talk about that trial that was underway. And any other areas of optionality that you would call out perhaps the DIY to branded switches within web scale cloud titans? Any updates there would be helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, Michael. As we said, the 7,800 is Arista's flagship AI platform. And we expect the better part of last year, maybe even the year before, Anshul, and you could correct me, doing a tremendous amount of simulation on how we work with GPU clusters and different types of stuff, network interface cards, the performance, the [indiscernible] list, dealing the diversity traffic, the latency, the transaction. And we believe that this will be a critical year in seeing those trials come into production. So, we do expect AI to be meaningful this year as opposed to not material the last couple of years. And we believe the 7,800 will be the flagship product for that. Anshul Sadana : And if I can just answer your other indirect question. Your question was how are we doing at these white boxes? Jayshree Ullal : We ship [the boxes] [ph] Anshul Sadana : We said this before. I think we are maintaining status quo. We're doing very well with our customers. They're not afraid, and we don't believe the market is sitting back to white box [indiscernible]. In fact, the core development efforts are even more intense than before. But I think largely speaking, we achieved status quo, I think that's where the market stays for now. Michael Ng : Thanks, Jayshree. Thanks, Anshul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open. Alex Henderson : Great, thanks. I've got a question that I want to split into two pieces. The first one is, as you're looking at market share in the AI arena, does the networking piece, gain share within the AI wallet budgets? And then second, I know that you've had a very significant share advantage in high-speed. You've gained significant share from your competitors for every year that I can remember. And I guess the question is, will AI drive an acceleration in your share given your dominant experience so far in delivering it? So, share within the CapEx wallet and then share within the AI market? Two related questions. Jayshree Ullal : Alex, let me go back to your high-speed acceleration question first, and then we\u2019ll talk about the market share in AI because we're still kind of grappling with what is the market for AI right now. In terms of high speed, I think \u2013 we've now got some [killer use cases] [ph] for 400 and 800-gig with AI. So, you will see our strength going from strength to strength with 100, 200 in some cases and now 400 and 800 with AI being killer application driving our high-speed acceleration. We feel more confident of it now. Otherwise, you could argue what is the use case for 400 and 800-gig. So that makes us very positive. Specific to AI wallet shift, quite honestly, the greatest component of AI today is the processers, that is 80%, maybe 90% of the spend and the applications, obviously, that go with that. So, if they're vertically integrated, we may not see as much of it, but if customers choose the horizontal best of breed we\u2019ll absolutely get our share of wallet there. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I just want to go back to this reduced visibility that you're seeing with the cloud titan. I guess, is it your sense that you just had extra-long visibility at four quarters and now going back to two quarters, which is normal or do you think there's a risk that it actually ends up an outright pause at some point given these companies did have a really big spending cycle with you in the last 4 or 5 quarters already. So, I'm just wondering, like is this a return to normalcy or do you think there's risk that we end up in a pause with one or both of them the way we've been in 2019? Thanks. Anshul Sadana : Hi, Amit This is Anshul. Our customers have been waiting for 2.5 years for this moment. So, they can return back to normalcy. Supply chain is recovering. These customers follow component lead times very closely as well to a great extent. We're coming back to where we used to be pre-COVID levels, nothing different \u2013 nothing more than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam, an Independent Analyst. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thank you for taking my question. Anshul, I wanted to ask you a question on Broadcom's recent introduction of the Jericho3-AI chip, and it kind of reminds me of the time when they first introduced the Jericho2 and 2C and you were the earliest adopters of that technology and that led to your significant gains in the leaf-spine architecture. So, is the Jericho3 a similar upgrade cycle? And should we think about the same advantages you guys are enjoying in this forthcoming cycle as you did in the previous cycle? Anything you can tell us in terms of the comparison? Anshul Sadana : So a good way to look at this market and the introduction of G3, G3 AI, you know 400 gig is not going to end quickly and suddenly get replaced with Jericho3. 400-gig will go on for some time, customers will take time to make changes. And so, especially when they don't need more bandwidth just yet.  At the same time, you'll see a quick adoption of 800-gig technology and there\u2019s a complementary chip that was also announced with [indiscernible] and Jericho3 AI, the AI teams will absolutely consume these as quickly as the market can get them out there. And you may have read some white papers that were also published along with the announcement, which showed that Jericho3 AI is scaled to very large clusters, we can scale to 4,000 GPUs quickly at 800-gig, and the cluster performs at 10% better throughput than InfiniBand. So that is why there's such needs for this technology out there, and everyone thanks us to get it. But just remember, the chips have just been announced. It takes time to get the chips, build systems, ship it to customers, [indiscernible] with the trials, and then go to the volume production. Jayshree Ullal : It's a very exciting multiyear journey, and we really value our partnership with Broadcom, but what you're seeing here is 100 gig for mainstream enterprises, 400 gig for the cloud and 800 gig and beyond for AI use cases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt Niknam : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just to go back to the macro discussion. I'm just wondering, were there any regions, customer verticals where you maybe saw some greater-than-usual slowness or lengthening sales cycles, particularly later in the quarter? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Matt, I'd say that usually, we see a very strong activity in the month of March, but in Q1, we did see some seasonality in certain regions, especially internationally. And I don't know how \u2013 one quarter, this is a trend base, but we're definitely watching this. Matt Niknam : Okay. And has that changed at all in early April? Jayshree Ullal : Too early to say. No. You mean has it changed in the sense it's improved in April. Is that your question? Matt Niknam : That's right. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, April is good so far. Matt Niknam : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with Rosenblatt. Your line is now open. Michael Genovese : Thanks for taking the question. Just one question for me. So basically, when \u2013 it's about timing on AI. And when do we think switching will inflect? And I guess maybe the actual question is, what's your outlook on 2024 cloud spending? I mean we've talked a lot about the next six months, but I went about 2024, how are we thinking about that right now? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Can we tell you six months before 2024 spending because we don't know. We don't have the visibility. Anshul Sadana : A little early for that yet, Mike. Michael Genovese : But what about on the timing of switches? I mean, as you go through all of these GPUs or processing units now, training, all of these things, when do you think the timing for switching deployments will inflect positively? Jayshree Ullal : You're asking specific to AI or cloud titan spending? Michael Genovese : Well, specific \u2013 I mean, AI is clearly happening now, but 80% to 90% of the spending is in stuff that you don't do. When do you think that there will be a significant uptick in that percentage of switching deployments in AI cluster data centers? Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Well, as I said, I think last year was the year of trials. This year, we'll see some production and it will certainly accelerate in 2024 and 2025 specific to AI, but again, that's a small spend relative to our larger cloud spend, where we'd like to see more visibility on how the cloud regions are getting built out, et cetera. Michael Genovese : That\u2019s fair. Thanks for clarifying. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey ladies, nice quarter and Anshul as well, of course. Purchase commitment, I wanted to circle back there as well, it's moving down as you guys anticipated. But obviously, you guys are a much larger business than you were pre-pandemic. So, I guess, how are you guys thinking about the level of normalcy of purchase commitments as we, kind of work through this. And obviously, Ita, you talked about that we'll see sequential impacts to cash flow still on the inventory as we, kind of convert that purchase commitment to inventory. Is that something that should reverse then in early 2024? And how should we, kind of think about free cash flow conversions for this year then? Ita Brennan : Yes. Look, I think if I have my ways, the purchase commitment number will come down significantly over the next, I don't know, 12 to 18 months right, because we don't need it once we start to see some of these component lead times come in. So, we need to \u2013 obviously to manage that. Some have long lead times that we do want to receive, and you will see that grow in inventory, some, we'll look to reposition, if we can. But obviously, there's a keen focus on kind of managing that number now. But the net of it is, I think you grow inventory through the year, it will consume some cash, and then it will flip in 2024, where we'll actually start to, kind of generate more cash as we start to bring that inventory number down. Do we ever go back to kind of where we were before? I think probably not. I mean we probably will carry a little bit more inventory and more buffers, having just gone through what we went through the last couple of years, but it should certainly get \u2013 come down from where it is today. James Fish : And any thoughts on the free cash flow conversion for the year? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think for this year, inventory is a consumer of cash. So, it's probably \u2013 it's hard to know exactly what that looks like, but I think every quarter, we'll increment that inventory balance as we go through the year, that will concern some cash. But I mean the P&L is highly cash positive with the guidance that we've put out. So, I think we'll still be generating a healthy amount of cash, but we will build inventory balance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Hi, thanks. Hi ladies, nice quarter. Ita, I wanted to dig into the comments on gross margin where you expect them to improve through the year? [Two things] [ph] there. Number one, what \u2013 now the supply chain is getting better. What is it in the supply chain that's still expensive that's hurting you on the gross margin side? And how does that get mitigated? And second, the improvement that you anticipate, is that just a reflection of the mix, meaning cloud perhaps moderating to your point or is most of the improvement driven again by supply chain \u2013 better pricing on the supply chain side? Ita Brennan : Yes. I mean I think in Q1, we were still consuming broker parts and other parts that we had purchased prior, right? Because I mean, obviously, you have to prepare for the quarter, that should get better in Q2 and then even more so as we go through the rest of the year, where we'll stop consuming those legacy, if you like, broker parts that you have in the pipeline. So, that will definitely help. The other thing that's important is now that we don't have the soft start of the [indiscernible] and stuff, we can focus on manufacturing, we can focus on driving manufacturing, driving efficiencies there, et cetera. So, we should see some improvements come out of that as we go through the year. I'm not assuming a whole lot of a change in the mix of the business, maybe a little bit more, but not a lot, just because we have a deployment pipeline for cloud, right? That is the discussion that we're having about cloud is more when do they need to place the orders for the next deployment. Now that there isn't deployments in front of us right now, right? So, I think that's an important distinction, right? So, I think we are pretty happy with how the cloud business is, kind of flat out through the rest of the year. The question becomes when do they place new orders [indiscernible] shorter lead times and when can we see what that \u2013 those new orders will look like? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Ita, I guess, more specific for you. Could you share any thoughts around OpEx with respect to R&D and sales and marketing? And how those have evolved through the year, given the visibility and supply and what you're seeing out there? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yes. I think we talked about a little bit in the script, but when we are continuing to hire, and we are continuing to make some investments, and we'll continue to do that, certainly within the envelope as we think about the business for the year today, we will continue to do that. It probably doesn't grow quite as fast as the top line, we'll see. But we are continuing to increment that quarter-over-quarter, and you'll see us continue to grow those investments. But again, it's headcount around R&D and go-to-market and really looking for good talent and places where we win an opportunity, right? But we will continue to invest, just given the envelope of business that we have in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. Can I ask a two-parter on the adjacencies. First, just curious on the campus side. Obviously, you guys have been growing nicely there. How do you think that tends to be more macro sensitive? So, how do you view being able to grow the same level in that sector when there becomes more natural headwinds like we're starting to see? And then on the routing side, I'm curious now that you're out with the full platform. Jayshree, if you \u2013 or Anshul, if you could just give us a little view of kind of what feedback has been and what you think kind of the revenue path would look like for increased routing business? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Tim, I think on the campus side, the TAM is somewhere between 10 billion and 15 billion. So, I don't want to make macro an excuse because I think we have some fantastic demand because of our fantastic products. That said, obviously, the way we will see the campus demand manifest as we may see longer decision cycles as the macro continues. But the actual interest in our products is just very solid, very good because we're still operating \u2013 we're still waiting for our first 1 billion here in the next few years. So, I think it's looking good. On the [wind routing] [ph], Anshul, you want to add some comments. It's been a very exciting launch, a lot of demand, it\u2019s still too early, right? Anshul Sadana : There's a lot of disruption happening in the market, even at the edge, right? When you talk about campuses, when you go and talk about what's inside the building, but there's an edge that connects to the outside, too. We have plenty of interest from our customers in this area. It is a bit too early. We just announced this offering. So, too early to jump up and down and say it's plus of membership. We'll watch it how it grows. But having the integrated solution is important to go after the broader enterprise market. Jayshree Ullal : Our existing customers \u2013 they see the natural affinity to our CloudVision and EOS tax. So that would be the natural spot. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Thanks for taking the question. Can you speak at least qualitatively about how much backlog you're using up at this point? And how long do you expect to continue working down backlog orders on a quarterly basis? Ita Brennan : Yes. I'd love to talk about backlog, Erik. I don't think we're going to do that. Look, I think it all comes back to lead times, right? The lead times is the driver of all else, right? We had [extensive lead times] [ph], customers had to place orders to those lead times. As lead times improved customers started to shorter lead time, that will slowly kind of navigate our way back to a more normal visibility window and lead time window right. I think we're taking the first steps of that now, right? But that's going to take time to get there. But that's what will happen as lead times will naturally bring visibility back to something more normal. But that's going to take some time. We're in the very beginning of that. Erik Suppiger : Is that a multiyear process? Ita Brennan : I don't know when we're back to normal. It will take time to get there. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We've pretty much said it will take us the back half of 2023. So, I think normal is early next year. Erik Suppiger : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one. If we could get a metric, the RPO value. And in terms of my question, it does seem as if you've had a number of announcements around some software capabilities around your campus and enterprise-focused products. And it feels like you've sort of built up a critical mass. I'm wondering how you look at that strategy in terms of its maturity and its readiness in terms of the software behind the campus portfolio, if there's anything still missing? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Thanks, Simon. I think most of our software is not stand-alone software. It's bundled either in CloudVision or EOS. There's very few stand-alone pieces, of course, as the MDR and the DANZ Monitoring Fabric. Specific to the campus, I would say they tend to look at it more as a solution where they bring in wired, wireless, they want an automation framework with CloudVision. They want some security capabilities. In RSA, we announced some of the missing gaps we filled. Historically, we've partnered with other vendors for Network Access Control and Arista introduced its first one. I'll talk about it more next quarter. But I think some of the gaps we are now starting to fill ourselves. But in the campus, it always tends to be a combination of platforms and software never stand-alone software alone. Simon Leopold : Yes. The RSA announcement was actually, sort of where my question was coming from. It felt like that was in my mind, maybe one of the final gaps, and that's what I'm really trying to understand here. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I was going to save this for next quarter, but I'll just give you the condensed version is the Arista Guardian for network identity, Agni, means fire in Indian language, Sanskrit. So, we'll spread some of the ice with our fire. Simon Leopold : Sounds good. And just the RPO value, do you have that handy? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think it's up about between 50 million to 60 million quarter-over-quarter. It did pick up a little bit on the software and services side, but not in that range. Still small numbers, a long way to go, yes. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, Two number questions. One is, could you just give us an idea on campus revenues in 1Q 2023, and that's going to trend in 2023? And then for cloud titans, is that expected to grow, grow double digits? Any kind of reference that you could make for what cloud titan is going to do for the balance of 2023? Ita Brennan : Yes. I don't think we're going to try to prevent the vertical split. I think what we said is, we think our two biggest customers will be at least 10% customers for the year, but it's not all we've really said on that front. Jayshree Ullal : And we feel good about that here. They're good partners, and despite all the volatility, we'll have a good year with them. And on campus, I think I gave you a number for 750 million by 2025. I'll stick with that, and we'll give that to you towards the end of the year when we really achieve something. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one last question, please. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. I guess just following on, on some of the questions about visibility and customers. Any evidence of customers building inventory of your products whether that's just stand-alone inventory or whether it's inventory that's maybe installed in the network, but not being fully utilized. I guess what I'm really asking is, any thoughts about excess inventory rather than just, kind of the normal buffers that are out there? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : I think you asked the question well and you almost answered it. It's just normal buffers. There's nothing excess in inventory we're seeing. Nothing abnormal. Ita Brennan : [And supply] [ph], there\u2019s so constrained. George. I mean, you are just guiding to \u2026 Jayshree Ullal : Gosh, if they have some, we'd like to know how they got it. George Notter : Thanks so much. Liz Stine : This concludes the Arista Networks first quarter 2023 earnings call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ending June 30, 2023. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks for 2023 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management, and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization, and the benefits of acquisition, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz, and happy last day in July, everyone. We delivered revenues of $1.46 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of a $1.58. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 15.2% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 61.3% was influenced by improving supply chain overheads and higher enterprise contribution. We do expect gross margins consistently improve every quarter this year and stabilize in 2024. International contribution registered at 21%, with the Americas at 79%. As we surpass 75 million cumulative cloud networking ports, we are experiencing three refresh cycles with our customers, 100 gigabit migration in the enterprises, 200 and 400 gigabit migration in the cloud and 400 going to 800 gigabit for AI workloads. During the past couple of years, we have enjoyed significant increase in cloud CapEx to support our cloud titan customers for their ever-growing needs, tech refresh, and expanded offerings. Each customer brings a different business and mix of AI networking and classic cloud networking for their compute and storage cluster. One specific cloud titan customer has signaled a slowdown in CapEx from previously elevated levels. Therefore, we expect near-term cloud titan demand to moderate, with spend favoring their AI investments. We do project, however, that we will grow in excess of 30% annually versus our prior Analyst Day forecast of 25% in 2023. The AI opportunity is exciting. As our largest cloud customers review their classic cloud and AI networking plans, Arista is adapting to these changes, thereby doubling down on our investments in AI. Arista is a proud founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium that is on a mission to build open, multi-vendor AI networking at scale based on proven Ethernet and IP. There are a lot of software and EOS considerations for AI. AI traffic and performance demands are different as it comprises of a small number of synchronized high bandwidth flows, making them prone to collisions that slow down the job completion time of AI cluster. As they connect thousands of GPUs, generating billions of parameters for petascale cloud clusters, Arista's EOS capabilities must also scale along with our AI spine and leaf platforms to achieve that consistent performance and throughput. Arista has been developing EOS features such as intelligent load balancing and advanced analyzers to report and rebalance flows that can achieve predictable performance. Customers can now pick and choose programmable packet header field for better entropy and efficient load balancing of their AI workloads. Network visibility is also important in the training phase for large datasets to improve the accuracy of large language models. Arista's new AI Analyzer monitors and reports traffic counters at microsecond-level windows to detect and address microbursts. Our AI strategy and platforms are resonating well with our early customers. Presently, in tech 2023, we are in the middle of trials for back-end AI networks, leading to pilots in 2024. We expect larger clusters and production deployments in 2025 and beyond. In the decade ahead, AI networking will become an extension of cloud networking to form a cohesive and seamless front-end and back-end network. In the non-cloud enterprise category, we continue to experience good momentum in both data center and campus. Let me illustrate with a few customer wins. The first is a -- is an international new classification win where the customer was seeking to modernize their legacy campus. Their endpoints included large and small campus locations, internal communication devices, various IoTs, CCTV, display boards, and much more. The customer mandated a fully automated workflow. Arista presented a highly optimized best-of-class cognitive campus where there is a single binary EOS image across all campus platforms, complete with a universal API and built-in automation features. The customer was set on a path to continued campus modernization. The next enterprise win involves both data center and campus with advanced EVPN L3 VPN over VXLAN routing architectures instead of the traditional Layer 2 extension. Distributed AVA sensors were strategically positioned within the network to capture and analyze traffic at critical points. This zero-trust approach emphasizes strict mitigation throughout the network as opposed to relying solely on silo security. The integration of real-time streaming telemetry and visibility [at pivot] (ph) capabilities proved to be paramount in obtaining this operational acceptance. The final win was in a large public sector, connecting redundant data centers to hundreds of campus locations with a large routing environment. They were challenged with complex MPLS routing that was hard to operate across the WAN and campus network. An upgrade of any magnitude implied several million dollars, impacting change controls to touch on all their sites. Arista demonstrated that the customer could use a single spine for both LAN and WAN to dramatically simplify and automate the whole environment within 30 days. This 80% reduction in total cost of ownership was made possible with Arista's modern cloud operating model. You can see a recurring theme here across all these customer wins, which is the power of our platform innovation, quality, and support with a low TCO and a single cloud vision and EOS software stack. Arista is diversifying its business to transform the enterprise to a modern network operating model. Before I hand to Ita, I would like to share with you that Ita is planning to retire sometime next year in 2024. She has had a stellar career at Arista as our Chief Financial Officer. Ita has been our business partner and friend for the past eight years. She has displayed the Arista away, always prioritizing our customers, employees and shareholders. Ita has demonstrated and delivered both growth and profitability with a very, very small G&A investment, often only 1.5% of revenue. These type of pristine financials are so rare in a fast-growing tech company and only possible with a shared vision between the CFO and CEO. Ita, thank you for your steady leadership and contribution. Undoubtedly, we will miss you next year when you retire. Over to you for financial metrics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree. That\u2019s very kind. It\u2019s been an amazing experience working with you and the whole Arista team over the last eight years. Now back to the numbers. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results are provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $1.46 billion, up 38.7% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 15.2% of revenue the quarter, up from 14.9% in Q1. International revenues for the quarter came in at $304.4 million or 20.9% of total revenue, up from 17.5% last quarter. This quarter-over-quarter increase largely reflected a healthy contribution from our enterprise customers in EMEA and APAC and some reduction in domestic shipments to our cloud titan customers which were unusually robust in the prior quarter. Overall gross margin in Q2 was 61.3%, in line with our guidance of approximately 61% and up from 60.3% last quarter. We continue to see incremental improvements in gross margin quarter-over-quarter with higher enterprise shipments and better supply chain costs, somewhat offset by the need for some additional inventory reserves as customers refined their forecasted product mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $287.3 million or 19.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $257.5 million. R&D spending came in at a $188.5 million or 12.9% of revenue, up from $164.8 million last quarter. This primarily reflected increased headcounts and higher new product introduction costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $79.6 million or 5.5% of revenue compared to $75.9 million in the last quarter with increased headcount and products demo costs. Our G&A costs came in at $19.1 million or 1.3% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $606.5 million or 41.6% of revenue. Other income and expense in the quarter was a favorable $31.6 million and our effective tax rate was 21.4%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $501.2 million or 34.4% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 316.5 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.58, up 46% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.7 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased $30 million of our common stock at an average price of $137.2 per share. We've now repurchased $855.5 million or 8 million shares at an average price of a $107 per share under our current $1 billion Board authorization. This leaves $145 million available for repurchase in future quarters. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Now turning to operating cash performance in the two quarter. We generated approximately $434.1 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance, partially offset by ongoing investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 49 days, down from 57 days in Q1, reflecting a strong collections quarter with good linearity of billings. Inventory turns were 1.2 times, down from 1.3 times last quarter. Inventory increased to $1.9 billion in the quarter, up from $1.7 billion in the prior period, reflecting the receipt of components from our purchase commitments and an increase in switch related finished goods. Our purchase commitments at the end of the quarter were $2.2 billion, down from $2.9 billion at the end of Q1. We expect this number to continue to decline in future quarters as component lease times improve, and we work to optimize our supply position. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1.085 billion, down from $1.092 billion in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenue balance declined approximately $33 million from last quarter. Accounts payable days were 57 days, up from 55 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. To recap, global supply chain disruptions over the last couple of years necessitated elongated planning horizons and customer demand signals. The crawler results are true, improving lead times and now driving shorter planning horizons and demand signals, delaying when customers need to place new orders. This is particularly true of our cloud titan customers who following a year of elevated purchases, is now rapidly changing technology roadmaps and priorities before providing visibility to future demand later in the year. On the supply side, we expect to continue to ship against previously committed deployment plans for some time, targeting supply improvements where most needed, but also careful not to create redundant customer inventory. In spite of the return to shorter lead times, reduced visibility, we are executing well with gradual incremental improvements to our 2023 outlook, which now calls for year-over-year growth in excess of 30%. On the gross margin front, we expect continued progress through the end of the year, reflecting supply chain and manufacturing benefits while maintaining a reasonably healthy cloud contribution. Now turning to spending and investments. We continue to monitor the overall macro environment carefully. We'll prioritize our investments as we move through the year. This will include a focus on targeted hires and R&D and go-to-market as the teams seek the opportunity to add talent. On the cash front, while we'll continue to focus on supply chain and working capital optimization, you should expect some continued growth in inventory through the end of the year. Also, as a reminder, our 2023 tax payments have been deferred to October and will represent a significant use of cash in that quarter. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, and other non-recurring item is us follows. Revenues of approximately $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion, gross margin of approximately 62%, operating margin at approximately 41%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, with diluted shares of approximately 318 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of William Ng with Goldman Sachs. Mike Ng : Hey, this is Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Thanks for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the outlook for -- in excess of 30% year-over-year growth this year on revenue? What's gotten better relative to last earnings call? If you could talk about it in the context of cloud titans versus enterprise, that would be helpful. I'm just trying to reconcile the revenue upgrade versus the commentary about near-term cloud titan growth moderating. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think it's pretty clear that from quarter-over-quarter, our enterprise momentum continues to get stronger and better. And our cloud is strong. However, it's got two components now. There's the classic cloud networking and then the AI. So we're reconciling how we double down more on AI, which we are feeling stronger and stronger about. And even on the cloud, you know that the last two years have just been out of this world and phenomenal. So while it's moderating, it\u2019s still pretty good. Liz Stine : Thanks, Mike. Mike Ng : Thanks, Jayshree. Liz Stine : Question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : Thank you. Jayshree, I was hoping you could dig more into some of the comments around AI. It sounds like there's -- a large pipeline there, and you talked about kind of the stages with 2025 being the big growth area. I'm curious if you can just talk a little bit about a few things related to that. One, do you see that the move to AI expanding or diversifying more your cloud titan or your cloud customers? And second, can you talk about kind of the next year or two the entire -- the InfiniBand versus Ethernet debate? I think you guys have been trialing some Ethernet inside clusters. Can you just give us an update on how you think that competition between those two technologies? How you think that's going to play out? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Thank you, Tim. Maybe my answer will be shorter than your question. But I think the gist of what I'd like to, first of all, say is majority of Arista's participation has been in the front end of the network. Right? And we're getting a chance for the first time ever to play in the back end. So when we think AI, there's clearly some ramifications of bandwidth on the front end of the network, but we're not counting that. So we're truly thinking of something that's incremental, brand new, lot of work to do in testing, proving, pilots, trials before we get into production. Today, I would say in the back end of the network, there are basically three classes of networks. One is very, very small networks that are within a server where customers use PCIe, CXL. There's proprietary NVIDIA-specific technologies like NVLink that Arista does not participate. Then there's more medium clusters, you can think generative AI mostly and inference, where they may well get built on Ethernet. For the extremely large clusters with large language training models, especially with the advent of ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4, you're not talking about not just billion parameters, but an aggregate of trillion parameters. And this is where Ethernet will shine. But today, the only technology that is available to customers is InfiniBand. So, obviously, InfiniBand with 10, 15 years of familiarity in an HPC environment is often being bundled with the GPUs. But the right long-term technology is Ethernet, which is why I'm so proud of what the Ultra Ethernet Consortium and a number of vendors are doing to make that happen. So near-term, there's going to be a lot of InfiniBand, and Arista will be watching that outside in. But longer term, Arista will be participating in an Ethernet AI network. And, neither technology, I want to say, were perfectly designed for AI. InfiniBand was more focused on HPC and Ethernet was more focused on general purpose networking. So I think the work we are doing with the UEC to improve Ethernet for AI is very important. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : We'll take our next question from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Just revisiting kind of the cloud titan commentary, does the change that you're seeing mean that they're completing kind of one upgrade cycle? There might just be time between the next upgrade cycle or are there are real changes to kind of current deployment plans or kind of deployment of the current upgrades? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yeah. Sorry. Jayshree Ullal : Sorry. Meta, were you addressing the question to Ita? Meta Marshall : I guess I was addressing to whoever wants to answer about the kind of commentary on the changes in the cloud titan order. Jayshree Ullal : Go for it, Anshul. Anshul Sadana : Sure. Meta, when you look at the cloud customers, in the last few quarters, especially since the advent of ChatGPT, there\u2019s been a rotation into AI. It's not that they're done with the upgrades or this is one of the upgrades, but they had to reprioritize their business and their deployments for AI. You've seen the competitive battle between the largest or the largest titans in the world trying to get ahead. But we see signs of that slowing. And in the future, we believe they'll be back to adding and refreshing the standard computer infrastructure as well. Jayshree Ullal : I always [Technical Difficulty] for so long eventually you have to eat. So I think we will see a nice mix of AI and classic cloud networking over time. Ita Brennan : Yeah. And I think that the lead time improvements have kind of facilitated them waiting for a little bit longer than what we've gotten used to over the last couple of years. But I think, again, that's kind of -- we're going to start coming within lead time here pretty soon, then we\u2019ll see. Yeah. Anshul Sadana : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Meta. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Ben Bollin : Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Ita, congrats. I had a question for you. I was hoping you could speak to where you see lead times presently, and you talked about taking a little bit more managed approach to inventory levels at customers. Could you talk about some strategies that you employ to manage that and where you might see -- where you think inventory levels are within those accounts? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yeah. I think, look, the lead times are mixed across products. I mean, our goal certainly is to try to get back to, like, a six-month lead time here, maybe the end of the year or certainly early year. But I think it is currently mixed across products. The commentary around customer inventory itself, we've been very diligent all the way through this process, the supply chain process of trying to make sure we understood demand when it showed up and that it was being put into reasonable deployment schedules and deployment plans. And we just want to continue to do that as we come through the other side of really that whole supply chain disruption. So it's really more, understanding kind of what customers need, when they need it and, again, being able to prioritize and make sure that we understand that. So it's really a continuation of what doing, honestly, on the other side of the supply chain when you have these -- when you have this kind of accelerated demand, and then we were very focused on deployment schedules and timing. And this is just the other side of that. Again, making sure we understand what's happening. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Antoine Chkaiban : Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Little bit of a longer term question, but can you please provide an update on the opportunity at hyperscalers beyond your two largest customers? Does the accelerated deployment of AI clusters potentially open the door to business with the other two hyperscalers as the complexity of the network is increasing rapidly? Anshul Sadana : So this gets asked very often, how we're doing that, and we continue to do well with them. As I mentioned before, not all titans are the same in terms of size. Some are small and we do very well with them, but they're just not as big as our two largest customers. And others who have the potential, we're still doing very well technologically with them but we haven't seen the opportunity materialize. It\u2019s not that we're losing to anybody. It's just nothing has changed. And we continue to invest with them, and we believe the opportunity is still ahead of us. Jayshree Ullal : Exactly, Anshul. I think the way to look at our AI opportunity is it's -- there's 10 years ahead of us. And we'll have early customers in the cloud with very large datasets, trialing our Ethernet now. And then we will have more cloud customers, not only Titans, but other high-end Tier 2 cloud providers and enterprises with large datasets that would also trial us over time. So in 2025, I expect to have a large list of customers of which cloud titans will still end up being some of the biggest, but not the only ones. Liz Stine : Thanks, Antoine. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Hello. Yep. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter here. I guess my question is really, there's been a fair bit of debate, I mean, investors on what does calendar \u201824 looks like for Arista. And the fear, always, it could look like calendar \u201820 when you had some cloud digestion. I realized it's really early for you to guide \u201824, but if you just sort of think about the puts and takes into next year, that would be helpful. And maybe, Jayshree, you could talk about how do you think Arista is different today versus in the calendar \u201919 and the \u201820 time frame, that would be helpful? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. That's a really good question. Stay tuned for our 2024 guide when we have our Analyst Day sometime in November. But qualitatively speaking, we're a very different company today than three years ago. Clearly, we've doubled down on our cloud titans and you'll that they're getting stronger and stronger. But even in the cloud titans, Anshul and the team have worked to have a number of use cases. It isn't just one. And the addition of AI to that use cases just gave us a whole lot of broad opportunity from front end to back end. Right? So to me, the holistic and seamless and cohesion between the front end and back end will get even more important as time goes on in cloud titans. We also see that we're stronger in Tier 2 providers and, of course, the broader enterprise. Both of these were not as strong for us three years ago, and they also represent AI opportunities, but as you know, they represent campus, routing, classical data center opportunities, and allow us to go target a much larger TAM, again, three years ago, it was probably $30 billion. Three years later, it's well north of $50 billion. So I feel we are much more diversified, and while we deeply appreciate M&M, we got a lot more candy beyond that. Liz Stine : Thank you, Amit. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hi, Ita. I have to ask you a tough one before you go, so you have good days for the rest few years. How much of the growth this time is coming from backlog drawdown? Can you give us some information about the order trends rather than revenues? And the reason why I'm asking it is because your guidance for 3Q is 25% growth. When I look at 4Q, it's the implied 11%, so there is a sharp deceleration in growth in 4Q and I'm wondering if it's a function of backlog -- end of elevated backlog? Thanks. Ita Brennan : I mean, look, we haven't talked about backlog and orders. I think we've talked more just in terms of deployments and deployment slots. And, if you think back to the -- to my commentary, I mean, we do believe that there are ongoing deployments that will go well into 2024. Right? So it's not, again, I don't necessarily sign up the terminology of the backlog and the drawdown, et cetera. So given how the orders and the patterns, it's very difficult [stopping that language] (ph). But I think in terms of deployments, you will have deployments that are already planned and scheduled into 2024. I think it will -- we're taking it quarter by quarter through the end of the year, but I'd still go back to my kind of incremental, look at it kind of incrementally quarter-over-quarter and continue to show some improvements as we guide to Q3. So Q4 is, take some similar kind of incremental improvement into Q4, and I think that's the way to think about it for now. But, again, I don't know that it's -- our commentary on kind of demand and lead time stands. Right? I mean, as lead time shorten, you will see some period of time where customers don't need to place orders until you get back into the lead time. And that dynamic is certainly there. And, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll get more visibility into next year. Jayshree Ullal : Tal, I think -- this is Jayshree. I know you asked a difficult question. Look, it\u2019s -- we'll know more as time goes on. And we think the business is strong and whether that comes in strongly in \u201824 or \u201825 or somewhere in between [Technical Difficulty] we shall see. Right? And the reality is it'll be difficult to repeat the last two years of exceptional cloud CapEx for cloud networking. So as they go through that deployment and as they look at AI, and as we bring in the enterprise and Tier 2 clouds, we've got a nice mix of things. And I urge everyone to think of our business as Ita has always alluded to, not in one quarter or even one year, but really a three-year CAGR. And I think our three-year CAGR will continue to be in double digits and good numbers. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Tom. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sebastien Naji with William Blair. Sebastien Naji : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can you maybe just update us on the visibility in your customer base? Is it still around six months, or are we now down closer to three months? And maybe just longer term, do you think that generative AI could help improve that visibility from where it's historically been just given that many of these hyperscalers have what seems like decent visibility into a pretty robust pipeline over the next few years? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. That's a really good -- Sebastien. I -- since we have so many products in the mix, I have to break your question into visibility across multiple areas. Enterprise, I would say six to 12 months, generally speaking. In the cloud, given the reduced lead times on classic cloud networking, it's less than six months. However, on AI, it is greater since it's an early cycle and we have to do a lot more joint development. So you can think of it as, three migrations going on with different visibility patterns. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I can shift gears here a bit to enterprise, Jayshree. And obviously, you're talking about the slowdown on the cloud side here a bit going into 2024. But when you look at enterprise, how do you think about sustaining a growth rate or the slowdown in that growth rate into 2024? What are you seeing in terms of orders on that front to sort of give you visibility into 2024? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Look, I think, Samik, this scenario that we feel pretty good about. And it's an area of great execution from Anshul, Chris Schmidt, Ashwin, and the entire team, where we have really diversified our business globally in the enterprise. We're not just in the high end financials. We're in just about every major vertical, healthcare, transportation, public sector, education, banks, insurances. So I feel enterprise, barring any macro issue, which is the thing we were always worry about for 2024. So If macro doesn't let us down and you don't have to worry about the economy, we will have a strong year in enterprise. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask just on product cycle cadence. There's a lot of focus from one of your key component suppliers in the merchant silicon side around 51.2 terabit silicon, and obviously supporting the 800 gig cycle. I'm curious, how do you think about the timing of that? When do we start to see the materializing deployments of 800 gig and maybe that's tied to AI, maybe it's not, but just curious of when that cycle you believe really starts to kick in? Anshul Sadana : Aaron, we had the same discussion when the world went to 400 gig, switching from 100 gig to 400gig. The reality was customers continue to buy both, 100 gig and 400 gig for different use cases. 51T and 800 gig, especially, are being puller by AI clusters, the AI teams, are very anxious to get their hands on it, move the data as quickly as possible, and reduce the job completion times. So you'll see early traction there. You'll see, as we mentioned, trial study in \u201824 going into volume in \u201825. And that should be the ramp we'll follow for 800 gig. But that does not mean everything they just bought last few years at 400 gig for DCI or the spines and so on for classic clusters are going to get upgrade to 800 gig. I think that's going to be a longer cycle. So you will see 100, 200, 400, and 800 get deployed in parallel as we enter that cycle in \u201824, \u201825. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Aaron. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering on the supply chain, if you can talk about how that's evolved over the last quarter? And as it relates to gross margin, I think you're messaging incremental improvements in 3Q and 4Q. Is that purely a function of easing supply chain, or is there also maybe greater relative contribution from enterprise relative to cloud titans envisioned in the second half of the year as well? Thanks. Ita Brennan : I mean, we're definitely seeing improvement on the supply chain side. We're seeing improvements with freight, improvements with just some of the expedite costs and the things that we were dealing with and we're kind of inventoried and now we're releasing them. So I think we're coming out from underneath that. There is some small shift in mix as well, but it's still a good strong cloud mix this quarter, this year. So, it's not like we're back to a heavy enterprise mix without creating a much smaller part. There's still a very healthy kind of cloud mix in this year. So it's more where we can back out our -- the supply chain stuff that we'd incurred in the past. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. I want to give a shout out, Mark Brillhart, our new Senior VP of Manufacturing, and John McCool, both in Anshul's team, have done a fantastic job of optimizing the supply chain. So those improvements are really playing a role in our quarter-to-quarter gross margins. Matthew Niknam : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Hey, thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow-up around some of the prior questions asked as many might have been asked already. But I know you guys aren't talking about visibility and don't discuss backlog, but is it still fair to assume that we should think about you guys returning to a normal environment from a supply perspective in the early part of next year? And I believe, Ita, you talked about, underneath assuming that hyperscalers or your cloud titans grow double digits for this year. Is it still fair to think about that kind of level for 2023? Ita Brennan : Yes. I think it\u2019s absolutely right? And I think that, we kind of forget that cloud is still an important part of 2023. Right? We're still executing on deployments and planning that we did some time back, right, all the way through this year. So cloud is still a significant piece of the of the business in in 2023. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. And, James, just to confirm, we expect a more normal setting in 2024 in terms of lead times. You're right to assume that. Liz Stine : Thanks, James. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could maybe do a little bit of unpacking in terms of what's driving your enterprise business in that I think the conventional wisdom is that enterprises are challenged by recessionary forces on the cycle, and then the secular challenge around public cloud adoption need slowing. So what do you see happening? How much of this success is related to market share gains? How much to general cycles, products, et cetera, if we could unpack the enterprise traction? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure, Simon. Well, of course, we have market share gains. That is a result of our enterprise traction, I would say. But if you ask me why are we winning in the enterprise, I would say, number one, from an alternative perspective, our customers haven't had one for a very long time. They haven't had a high-quality, high supportive, very, very friendly software experience, a common leaf spine architecture across their data center campus routing in a long, long time. So, I think the architectural shift in the enterprise to move into a modern cloud operating model is the number one reason that Arista has been chosen. They are seeking our architecture for that quality experience. In fact, Anshul and I were just talking about the call. We use the word cloudify a lot, and it\u2019s quite tricky right. Our high-end enterprises are really looking for the cloud principles, but however on their premise. In terms of the shift between workloads in the cloud and workloads on the enterprise, it depends on the customer. You're still seeing some of the mid-market customers want to move their e-commerce workloads on the cloud. But a lot of their mission-critical applications stay on the premise. So, our hybrid strategy continues to dominate the enterprise decisions for the data center. Secondly, our entry into the campus and routing as well as zero-trust security, observability, et cetera. is adding more layers to the cake. So, our product depth and breadth is getting better and better. So, the cloud operating model, the product that depth -- and now actually, we've been at it now for, what do you say, Anshul, three years to five years maybe? So, especially, in United States, we're got more work to do internationally. I would say we've been engaging with these customers -- I remember when Ita and I had a discussion, I want to say five years ago, where she was right and I was wrong, and she persuaded me to invest more in the enterprise. So, I think all these things have gone into really making us who we are in the enterprise. And clearly, we are a gold standard and we have a seat at the table there. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thank you, Simon. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations, Ita. I just want to go back to the point of maybe help bridge the '23 to '24 to '25 commentary that Jayshree mentioned sort of strong double-digit growth. I think in the past you've talked about 15% growth across cycles. And I'm just trying to think through, is there enough in trials and pilots in '24 to kind of get you to that kind of mid-teens growth over the next couple of years? And if not, does that mean that your enterprise business has to remain incredibly robust in '24, upwards of high-teens to low 20% growth next year? I know you're not giving guidance. But trying to kind of walk the bridge to get from where we are today to '25 where you're going to start to see more widespread AI deployments from a revenue recognition perspective. Thanks. Ita Brennan : So, now you want to go to '25 as well. I don't think we're ready to do that. But that's a really good conversation for the Analyst Day honestly. I think, we obviously, are very focused internally. As Jayshree reiterated earlier on, the business is a lot more robust with many different drivers. As you go through that period, cloud will ebb and flow, but it's still a healthy business. It has been a healthy business through those cycles. So, I think we've got a lot of the building blocks, but how we're going to assemble them, maybe we'll save for the for the Analyst Day. Jayshree Ullal : We'll share the legal plan more. But David, rest assured that we are aiming for at least double-digits next year. And so, we'll go from there. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys. And congrats, again. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik Suppiger : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe this is for Anshul. Can you just walk us through kind of how the cloud titans work? We hear a lot about them buying volumes of GPUs right now. At what point do their purchasing of GPUs translate into their demand for switches? How does it work with the trials and so on and so forth? Anshul Sadana : Sure. There is no uniform recipe, but in general, when they're buying GPUs, [Technical Difficulty] to connect. These could be off few quarters depending on their timing of deployments till they build the network [Technical Difficulty] very large things. But it takes some -- a couple of months sometimes, a quarter or more, to fine-tune the cluster and benchmark and test everything before it is actually released to production. So, you can think of that as sort of the basis, a couple of months, a couple of quarters minimum before you can get there. Sometimes it adds up to about a year before you really ramp into production. Liz Stine : Great. Thanks, Erik. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. I guess I wanted to ask about your comments about 2025 participation in AI. Could you walk us through sort of the milestones that you see between now and then in terms of increasing Arista's participation? Certainly, there is new product development, there is market acceptance, I presume. And then also I assume that you participate today with inferencing applications and that's by and large done on Ethernet. I think what we're really talking about is training, correct? So any more color there would be great. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, George. So, I think you can look at 2023 as really a year of planning for AI, because as I said, there's tons and tons of GPUs being purchased. And then the question is how is it being connected. So, depending on whether they are small, medium, or large, they're different technologies, but I'm going to stay focused on the large because that's the biggest problem. You are right to say some of them maybe Ethernet or even a non-networking technology, just an IO or a bus for smaller networks. But generally speaking, we're focusing on things that are much larger than 200 or even 1,000 GPUs. So that's the first thing. So, a lot of planning is going into that. And the planning basically is, how do they get the GPUs, what is their application, what is the size of the cluster, what is the time, what is the large language model datasets, et cetera, and what is their network foundation. In some cases, where they just need to go quick and fast as I explained before, it would not be uncommon to just bundle their GPUs with an existing technology like InfiniBand. But where they're really rolling out into 2025, they're doing more trials and pilots with us to see what the performance is, to see what the drop is, to see how many they can connect, what's the latency, what's the better entropy, what's the efficiency, et cetera. That's where we are today. Now, we expect next year this will translate to some, what I call, pilots, because majority of them will happen in '25, but in '24, you'll start seeing, what do you say, Anshul, maybe 4,000 to 8,000 GPUs, something like that? Anshul Sadana : That's right. In that range. Jayshree Ullal : In that range, okay. 4,000 to 8,000 GPUs at about 400 gig type clusters. So we will actually put some production workloads on it. So, I call them smaller pilots. But the real test of why you buy these expensive GPUs in 2025, when you want to have not just 4,000 to 8,000, but 30,000, 50,000, maybe even 100,000, and this is why 2025 is so critical. And taking -- testing and taking out all the kinks out of the GPUs and networks is important because your network is so -- a good network is so pivotal to getting the most out of your GPUs. If you have idling cycles on those GPUs, you wasted thousands, if not millions, of dollars. And so, I think these next two years are crucial to getting the most out of these expensive GPUs and that's where the network really comes in. Anshul? Anshul Sadana : If I can add one more thing here, what are the milestones to get to these 2025 [large scale] (ph) deployments, there is one key milestone. That has nothing to do with GPUs or our switches, which is does the customer have enough power and the site ready to deploy that many megawatts or gigawatts of capacity. And as you know, getting a 1,500 megawatt site takes a couple of years, which is why this is a floor ramp. This does not certainly turn on the key and you have thousands of GPUs. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, really good point. Simple things like power and space are still vital. Liz Stine : Thanks, George. Operator : We'll take our next question from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Karl Ackerman : Yes. Thank you. Jayshree, there's been some investor concern that hyperscale customers may focus more on white box solutions for 800 gig WAN in the 400 gig cycle. We're aware that some of your customers continue to adopt to dual-sourcing strategy. But if you could just comment on the potential for an upgrade cycle as well as reuse risk on the transition to 800 gig, it will be very helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. So, as you're probably well aware, the white box question has remained with the Arista as one of the most popular questions asked right from the time of our IPO, whether it's a 10 gig, 40 gig, 100 gig, 400 gig, or now you ask it at 800 gig, I think there will always be an element of white box if somebody is just looking to build something and throw in some quick traffic. But for some of these most mission-critical networks, it's less about the box and more about the software stack and how much performance availability, power you really get out of this. So, the cost of putting in the box, if you save something, if you even save something, is far dwarfed by the total OpEx you need to make that box work. So, we continue to believe that we will coexist with white box in some of our cloud titan customers. We will continue to run both SONiC and FBOSS in the case of Microsoft and Meta along with our EOS. But at the end of the day, whether it's a white box or a blue box, it's the software stack that really wins. Liz Stine : Thanks, Karl. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our last question from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks a lot for sneaking me in there. Congratulations, Jayshree and team. I wanted to ask about enterprise again. I think the comments you made around cloud titans were all things that people were able to detect, but the enterprise just seems so much better in terms of the performance and the guide. So, you mentioned that you gained share, but did the market pick up as well? And did you -- do you see that market pickup in demand in the enterprise sustaining into '24? And just kind of more color around enterprise and whether the market picked up in addition to you gaining share. Jayshree Ullal : Hey, Ben. Thank you. What do you mean by the market pickup? I don't follow the question. Ben Reitzes : Did demand pick up? Because the enterprise outperformance was quite a surprise, and clearly the cloud titan commentary was subdued as everybody was able to predict after the last conference call this week. So, I mean, was it all market share or is the market picking up? Is demand picking up across the board? Jayshree Ullal : I would say to you that probably our enterprise demand has always been strong and not subdued, far from that, however, dwarfed by the excellence of our cloud performance. You didn't notice it and now you're noticing it. Liz Stine : Thanks Ben. This concludes the Arista Networks second quarter 2023 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on our Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30, 2023. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlook for 2024 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management, and inflationary pressures on our business, lead time, product innovation, working capital optimization, and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on the call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz, and happy Halloween, everyone. We delivered revenues of $1.51 billion for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.83. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 16.8% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 63.1% was influenced by improving supply chain overheads and higher enterprise contributions. As we have said before, gross margins have consistently improved every quarter this year and will stabilize next year in 2024. International contribution registered at 21.5%, with the Americas at 78.5%. As predicted, Arista's supply chain and lead times are improving steadily in 2023 and we expect it to normalize in 2024. We are now projecting 33% annual growth versus our prior Analyst Day forecast of 25% growth for the 2023 calendar year. During the past year, our cloud titan customers have been planning a different mix of AI networking and classic cloud networking for their compute and storage clusters. Our historic classification of our cloud titan customers has been based on industry definition of customers with or likely to attain greater than 1 million installed compute servers. Looking ahead, we will combine cloud and AI customer spend into one category called cloud and AI titan sector. And as a result of this combination, Oracle OCI becomes a new member of the sector, while Apple shifts to cloud specialty providers. This new cloud and AI titan sector is projected to represent greater than 40% of our total revenue mix due to the favorable AI investments expected in the future. In terms of enterprise momentum, Arista continues to focus on multi-domain modern software with architectural superiority based on our single EOS, Extensible Operating System, and CloudVision stack. This is truly a unique foundation and differentiator. We have demonstrated our strong execution and uncompromised quality with predictable release cadence that our customers have come to enjoy and appreciate. The power of our one consistent software stack across a breadth of use cases, be the WAN routing, campus, branch, or data center infrastructure, is truly unmatched by our industry peers. Let me illustrate with a few customer wins. Our first customer win is an international one where the customer is providing services for their interconnect of high-performance compute, HPC, clusters, which are often its foundation for GPU as a service offering. Arista's Ethernet modular switch coupled with EOS created a perfect combination of a phishing platform with real-time telemetry leveraging our EOS state-driven publish/subscribe model. Our next win showcases our expansion of Arista in the public sector with their AI initiative. This grant-funded project utilizes Arista's simplified operational models with CloudVision. New AI workloads require high scale, high radix, high bandwidth, and low latency, as well as a need for granular visibility. This build out of a single EVPN VXLAN-based 400 gig fabric is based on deep buffer spines and underscores the importance of a lossless architecture for AI networking. This last but not least customer is an example of a campus WAN. Couple of years ago, the customer was looking to do a complete refresh of their aging campus network which comprises of four major headquarter campuses and several remote sites. The customer was able to leverage the Arista Validated Design models, AVD, all the way from data center into the campus network. The customer chose Arista because they were able to offer best-of-breed operational excellence, as well as security with our zero trust AVA sensors for threat mitigation across the entire campus of wired switches. Arista's innovative macro segmentation, MSS, combined with Leaf access and core Spine, delivered a compelling two-tier cognitive campus solution. These three customers illustrate our power of the platform and software innovations for a modern network model with a low total cost of operation. We are pleased with our trajectory, setting the gold standard in our industry with the lowest CVEs and vulnerabilities and the highest Net Promoter Score for cloud networking. And with that, I'd like to hand to Ita, our CFO, for financial specifics. Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 '23 is based on non-GAAP. It excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $1.51 billion, up 28.3% year-over-year, and well above the upper end of our guidance of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 16.8% of revenues in the third quarter, up from 15.2% in Q2. International revenues for the quarter came in at $324.7 million, or 21.5% of total revenue, up from 20.9% last quarter. This quarter-over-quarter increase largely reflected a healthy contribution from our enterprise customers in EMEA and APAC and some reduction in domestic shipments to our cloud titan customers. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 63.1%, well above guidance of approximately 62% and up from 61.3% last quarter. We continue to see incremental improvements in gross margin quarter-over-quarter with higher enterprise shipments and better supply chain costs, somewhat offset by the need for additional inventory reserves as customers refine their forecast product mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were $255.6 million, or 16.9% of revenue, down from last quarter at $287.3 million. R&D spending came in at $164.4 million, or 10.9% of revenue, down from $188.5 million last quarter. It's primarily reflected increased headcount more than offset by lower new product introduction costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $79 million, or 5.2% of revenue, consistent with last quarter, with increased headcount and some reduction in product demo costs. Our G&A cost came in at $12.1 million, or 0.8% of revenue down from last quarter and reflecting the recovery of some bad debt amounts recorded in prior periods. Our operating income for the quarter was $696.2 million or 46.1% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $42.3 million, and our effective tax rate was 21.3%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $581.4 million, or 38.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 317.6 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.83, up 46.4% from the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $4.5 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock in the quarter. To recap our repurchase program to date, we have repurchased $855.5 million, or 8 million shares, at an average price of $107 per share, under our current $1 billion Board authorization. This leaves $144.5 million available for repurchase in future quarters. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, stock price, and other factors. Now, turning to operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated approximately $699 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance combined with some increase in deferred revenue and taxes payable. DSOs came in 51 days, up from 49 days in Q2, reflecting the strong collections quarter and a good linearity of billing. Inventory turns were 1.1 times, down from 1.2 last quarter. Inventory remains flat to last quarter at $1.9 billion, reflecting the ongoing receipt in consumption components from our purchase commitments and an increase in switch-related finished goods. Our purchase commitments at the end of the quarter were $2 billion, down from $2.2 billion at the end of Q2. We expect the overall purchase commitment number to continue to decline as we further optimize our supply positions. However, we will maintain a healthy position related to key components, especially as we focus on new products. Our total deferred revenue balance is $1.195 billion, up from $1.085 billion in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance and services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenues balance increased by $47 million from last quarter. Accounts payable days were 44 days, down from 57 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipt payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $11.2 million. Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Customer planning horizons for new deployments have shortened in concert with steadily improving lead time. On the supply side, we expect to continue to ship against previously committed deployment plans for some time, targeting supply improvements where most needed, but also careful not to create redundant customer inventory. As outlined in our guidance, we expect to make incremental improvements to our 2023 outlook, which now calls for year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 33%. On the gross margin front, we expect gross margins of approximately 63% in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing supply chain and manufacturing benefits while maintaining a reasonably healthy cloud contribution. Turning to spending and investments, we expect to monitor the overall macro environment carefully while engaging in targeted hiring in R&D and go-to-market as the team sees the opportunity to acquire talent. On the cash front, while increases in working capital has begun to moderate in recent quarters, our year-to-date 2023 tax payments have been deferred to October, and this will represent a significant incremental use of cash in the fourth quarter at approximately $352 million. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion; gross margin of approximately 63%; operating margin of approximately 42%; our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, with diluted shares of approximately 319 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Ita. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everybody please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thank you for the question, and congrats on the results. I guess just to keep it simple, Jayshree, if you can give us an update on when we think about the last 90 days, how have the two sort of verticals, cloud titans and enterprise, sort of shown up in terms of momentum of orders and demand relative to where your expectations were 90 days ago? I know some of the cloud companies have talked about their CapEx outlook for next year as well. So, an update on that would be helpful. And on the last call, you did talk about a target for double-digit growth next year. So, how are you thinking in relation to that number still going into the Investor Day? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. Thanks, Samik. First of all, we are looking forward to sharing more detail on Analyst Day. But just to reiterate, our team has always projected at least a double-digit growth for next year and years beyond. So that goal remains unchanged. And we'll share more with you. Coming back to the last 90 days, as you know, as our lead times improve, our visibility declines. But we don't see significant change in improvements or declines in the last 90 days. We continue to see good momentum on enterprise and we continue to see a good expected push on the combination of both cloud and AI together. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Liz Stine : Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Your line is open. Antoine Chkaiban : Thanks very much for taking my question. So, accelerated AI cluster deployment is clearly waiting on traditional infrastructure deployment this year. And I'm keen to hear how sustainable you think this is, because the vast majority of workloads still run on traditional infrastructure, right? So, is it fair to expect a rebound in traditional infrastructure spend next year? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, thank you, Antoine. I'll share some of my thoughts and I'd like to hand it over to Anshul for further thoughts. We've always looked at the cloud network as a front-end and a back-end. And as we said last year, many of our customers are favoring spending more on the back-end with AI, which doesn't mean they stopped spending on front-end, but they've clearly prioritized and doubled down on AI this year. My guess is as we look at the next few years, they'll continue to double down on AI, but you cannot build an AI back-end cluster without thinking of the front-end. So we'll see a full cycle here where, while today the focus is greatly on AI and the back-end of the network, in the future we expect to see more investments in the front-end as well. Anshul Sadana : Jayshree, that's right. You said it's spot on. AI is everyone's priority right now, and the rest will get touched at the right time. Antoine Chkaiban : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Antoine. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt Niknam : Hey, thank you for taking the question. One question, very simple one, on services. Pretty nice improvement, about 13% sequential improvement in the quarter. Seasonally, I think we've seen low-single digits, mid-single digits. Anything you would call out? And how are we thinking about that for the fourth quarter? Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yeah, look, I think every now and again you see kind of a pop on the services line. It's usually either somebody has consumed services faster than they intended to or we've been negotiating a contract and then when we do actually finally sign the renewals contract, there's some flush of prior periods into the quarter. So, if you look back historically, you'll see that happens from time to time. I don't think it changes the kind of fundamental growth and services we've talked about that's kind of mid to maybe a little bit higher teens growth on an ongoing basis year-over-year. I don't think it changes that. It's just you do have these little spikes from time to time. Matt Niknam : Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. I suppose this is a question for Ita, but is the upside in the quarter an outlook coming from a combination of better bookings and working down some of your prior backlog? Just any thoughts in terms of maybe where your backlog may end up relative to normal levels pre-pandemic would be super helpful. Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yeah, Karl, we don't talk about backlogs, specifically. I think what we have said is, as lead times improve, you expect to see some reduction in visibility [because] (ph) customers, the time where they have to pay orders changes over time, right? So I think that we are seeing that dynamic, we've talked about that dynamic that we are -- as lead times get better, we are seeing kind of customer planning horizons are shortening. We will be still deploying, if you listen to my prepared remarks, I mean we are still deploying equipment into next year from plans that we made some time ago, and that's just kind of again working with customers and laying out their plans. But in terms of giving specific numbers, we haven't done that. Liz Stine : Great. Thanks, Karl. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on a nice set of numbers here. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on the enterprise side. You're seeing some really good strength over here clearly. But maybe you can talk about, is the strength more coming from campus versus the data center side, maybe just qualitatively where you're seeing better trends? And really the context of this is I think a lot of your peers are seeing a very severe drop in their growth rates as their backlogs have gone away. You don't seem to be having that issue. So I'm wondering like what is the offset to that and what's enabling the growth? And to the extent, you can talk about campus versus the data center that would be really helpful. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Amit. Again I'll share a few words and I'd love for Anshul to step in and say some too. Look, if you look back three years ago, we started seriously investing in the enterprise. And back in 2020, we had a small enterprise business and it was largely comprised of, as you rightly pointed out, data center and some high-performance compute and low-latency HFT. Can't ever forget our original heritage. But in the last three years, we have made an investment and seen a significant uptake in enterprise customers wanting to do business with Arista. Historically, it's been the high-tech enterprise and the financials. And today, we're seeing a much better cross section of verticals, including healthcare, education, we expect to see more and more distributed enterprises. And to your question on data center versus campus, the answer is yes, to both. We actually see one uniform architecture where you can have a universal spine that connects into a wired leaf, a wireless leaf, a storage cluster, a compute cluster, a border leaf for routing, and WAN transit. It's pretty exciting that Arista is truly and remarkably setting the tone for a two-tier defined architecture across the enterprise, and building that modern operating model based on CloudVision. Anshul Sadana : Amit, this is Anshul here. We have a great team being led by Chris Schmidt and Ashwin Kohli in this space. And now we sell in many, many countries around the world. And as Jayshree mentioned, both data center and campus, customers are coming to us for the automation for the higher quality, for the visibility, that we're able to bring to them across the board in one architecture, one OS, and one CloudVision. That message resonates with every CIO today, and they are no longer worried about Arista being this new kid on the block that's risky move for them. We are, in fact, becoming the de facto and they like it. So, which is why the momentum just continues. It's good execution by the team and getting to more and more customers around the world. Liz Stine : Thank you, Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Thanks for taking the question. Good evening, everyone. Jayshree and Anshul, I was hoping you might be able to comment a little bit about your thoughts as you make progress in the backend network around GPU cluster opportunity, how you see that developing versus what you've shared with us previously? And any color in particular around both pre-existing and the opportunity for net new wins would be helpful. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Again, this is an area that Anshul lives and breathes more than I do, so I'll give you some executive comments. But, Ben, as I see it, the back-end network was something we didn't even see a few months or years ago and was largely dominated by InfiniBand. Today, if I look at the five major designs for AI networking, one of them is still very InfiniBand dominated, all the others we're looking at are adopting a dual strategy of both Ethernet and InfiniBand. So, I think AI networking is going to become more and more favorable to Ethernet, particularly with the Ultra Ethernet Consortium and the work they're doing to define a spec, you're going to see more products based on UEC. You're going to see more of a connection between the back-end and the front-end using IP as a singular protocol. And so, we're feeling very encouraged that especially in 2025, there will be a lot of production rollout of back-end and of course front-end based on Ethernet. Over to you, Anshul. Anshul Sadana : Sure, thanks, Jayshree. Ben, our cloud titan customers, as well as the specialty providers, have been great partners of ours. So, the level of partnership and co-development that's going on in this space is high. It's just like in previous cycles, previous products that we've done with them, there's a lot of fine tuning needed in these back-end networks to get the maximum utilization of GPUs. And as you know, we are good at these [engineering] (ph) projects. So the teams are enjoying it. The activity is much, much higher than before. And the goal is to scale these clusters as quickly as possible so our customers can run their jobs faster. We're feeling good about it. You've heard comments from Jayshree as well in the past, and you'll hear more on the analysts here on this topic, too, but all good on the activity front over here. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : I think one thing to just add is the entropy and efficiency of these large language models and the job completion time is becoming so critical that it's not just about packet latency, it's really about end-to-end latency. And this is something our team, especially our engineers, know a lot about from the early days. So, we're really working this end to end. Liz Stine : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I just want to kind of dovetail off that last question a little bit. I know, Jayshree, last quarter, I think it was you commented that you'd expect to see pilot deployments for these AI opportunities in '24 and then meaningful volume in 2025. First of all, do you reaffirm that view, or has that changed at all? And then on that, can you give us some context of how you see network spend intensity for these AI fabrics relative to, I think in the past, it's been kind of high-single-digit percent of compute spend on networking in classical cloud infrastructure environments? Jayshree Ullal : Well, first of all, Aaron, the first question is easy. I reaffirmed that view and more later on November 9 at our Analyst Day. So, if I tell you everything now, you may not attend that session. Coming back to this networking spend versus the rest of the GPUs and et cetera, I would say it started to get higher and higher with 100 gig, 400 gig, 800 gig, where the optics and the switches are more than 10%, perhaps even 15%, in some cases 20%. A lot of it's governed by the cables and optics too. But the percentage hasn't changed a lot in high-speed networking. In other words, it's not too different between 10, 100, 200, 400, and 800. So, you'll continue to see that 10% to 15% range. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Aaron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi. Jayshree, your tone is definitely better this quarter than last quarter, and you sound more confident in the numbers. And I want to understand if something changed in the last three months that made you more optimistic. I'm looking at the consensus estimates and it looks like the growth rate has been declining for four quarters from like 54% to about 20% next quarter. And then, it troughs at Q1, stays there and recovers after that. Do you agree that we are nearing kind of the end of the down adjustment to the growth rates and then it's going to stabilize and go up from there? Or how do you look at the risks of that not materializing? Jayshree Ullal : What do you think, Ita? Ita Brennan : So, Tal, I think, look, we've been talking about kind of the growth decelerating as we move through the year, just because the comps are so high. I think if you look at the discussion we've had so far about '24, and obviously there's more to come next week, we've talked about double-digit growth. But again, we are expecting that there is some moderation on the cloud side of the business next year. So, I think within the bounds of kind of the plans that we've laid out and discussions that we've laid out, I think we're executing well, right? We're giving you some upside in the guide for '23 and by default almost, some upside in '24, right? So I think we're executing well, but within the bounds of what we talked about. And we do believe that there's moderation of cloud spending as we head into 2024. Jayshree Ullal : And Tal, I think I need to focus on my tone and maybe sing a song or something, because I felt really [enthusiastic] (ph) last quarter and this quarter. Ita Brennan : I would say she was pretty happy last quarter. Jayshree Ullal : I'm a happy kind of gal at the moment. Tal Liani : We read in between the lines, you know? Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tal. Liz Stine : Thank you, Tal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sebastian Naji with William Blair. Your line is open. Sebastian Naji : All right, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the change in revenue breakdown and the inclusion of OCI in this new cloud titan and AI segment. Was this the result of the material change in Arista's wallet share at Oracle, or is that business becoming a larger portion of revenue? Anything you can provide there? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, no, we don't do it based on wallet share of Arista. We do it based on definition. So, I think OCI has become a meaningful top-tier cloud customer, and they belong in the cloud titan category in addition to their AI investments as well. So, for reasons of classification and definition, the change is very warranted. And yes, they happen to be a good customer of Arista. That's nice as well. Sebastian Naji : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Liz Stine : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Jayshree or Anshul, maybe just some commentary on the tier-two and specialty providers, and just what you're seeing in terms of other people kind of building out some of these AI clusters? You classify some of those customers as largely focused on back-end today and those represent opportunities going forward, or just kind of what the discussion is outside of the cloud titans amongst some of these other guys that are building very large networks? Thanks. Anshul Sadana : Sure. Meta, this is Anshul. The tier-two cloud providers are doing exactly what the tier-one is doing, just at a smaller scale. So, the activity is out there. Many companies are trying to build these clusters, maybe not hundreds of thousands of GPUs, but thousands of GPUs together in their real estate if they can get them. But the designs that we're working on with them, the type of sort of features, fine tuning is actually very, very similar to the cloud, just at a smaller scale. So, we're very happy with that activity. And this is across the board. It's very positive to see this in the ecosystem that it's not limited to just four or five customers. Jayshree Ullal : I think they're also waiting for GPUs like everyone else is. So, there's that common problem that we're not the only one with lead time issues. But to clarify the comment on scale, Anshul and I are also seeing some very interesting enterprise projects against smaller scale. So, a lot of customers are trying AI for small clusters, not too different from what we saw with HPC clusters back in the day. Anshul Sadana : Yeah. Meta Marshall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just had one on the OpEx outperformance in the quarter. We saw an unseasonal decline quarter-on-quarter, And I think you mentioned lower product introduction costs that may have helped R&D. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that aspect of it. Any way we should think about product introductions going forward to help us understand the trajectory of OpEx? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Yeah, I mean a lot of it is timing, right? We've got a lot of different projects, a lot of different products kind of filling through the R&D labs right now, so there is going to be some kind of volatility in terms of when the spend shows up, when the proto spend happens, et cetera. So I think we were lower this quarter in Q3 than maybe we even anticipated coming into the quarter. I expect that to come back and kind of the guide for Q4. And again, there may be some volatility in that even going forward, just because it's all about timing, nothing unusual in that. There's just a lot of products kind of going through the R&D labs. Jayshree Ullal : So, Michael, when the chips are down, our spending is down, but when the chips come on hot, our spending gets hot too. So, expect our prototypes to have some high variability and we've got a lot and lot of new products in the pipeline that Andy, Anshul, Ken, you are all working on. So, we expect that number to go up over the next four quarters. Michael Ng : Great, very helpful. Thanks, Jayshree. Thanks, Ita. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Jayshree, at the recent Open Compute Project Conference, Marvell and Broadcom, leading Ethernet switch merchant chip providers sounded very confident in terms of Ethernet adoption at hyperscalers like Meta and Oracle as well. And one of your peers has talked about 500 million in AI orders, whether it's custom chip. So, I was curious about your thoughts on the dynamics between custom chip and merchant switch chip providers, and how does that help Arista? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, Atif, we have been strong proponents in our last 15, 17 years of Arista Korea on merchant silicon. We look for the best of breed chips. It's something my team, engineering team, has built a lot of chips in their past before, but we decided to work with the best of breed companies, Broadcom being one of our favorite and major suppliers. Of course, in the past, we worked with Intel, Cavium, and we don't rule out other suppliers as well. But this is clearly an area where you can't just build one chip, you have to build a portfolio of silicon. And what Broadcom has done in building that portfolio not only for cloud networking, but for campus and AI is impressive. And you have to not just look at performance, you have to look at price, density, power. These are all very important metrics as we look ahead. The root issue here, and we'll share this more with you going forward as well, is not just the merchant silicon, but how you can enable the merchant silicon with the right software and drivers. And this is an area that really Arista excels in. If you just have chips, you can't build a system. But our system-wide features, whether it's in dynamic load balancing or latency analyzer to really improve the job completion time and deal with that frequent communication and generative AI is also fundamentally important. You're going to hear a lot more about this next week, so stay tuned. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes : Yeah, hey, thanks for the question. Jayshree and Ita, can you discuss a little more your gross margin commentary that it should moderate next year from the 63% levels in the back half? I mean, are we talking about it going to the first half '23 kind of levels, or just a little bit of a degradation next year? And what would be the reason behind it? Other than lead times, is there any other mix or other issues that would cause it to go down? Thanks. Ita Brennan : So, Ben, I think what Jayshree commentary, my commentary, is we have been seeing it incrementally improve as we've gone through the year. We expect it to stabilize. So not that we expect it to go down next year, but more that it will stabilize. And then it will become more dependent on customer mix and other thing again, similar to where we've been before. But obviously, we'll provide more outlook on -- discussion on this next week too. But the intention was not to say that we think it starts to decline again. It was more that we think it will stabilize after a period where we've been seeing these incremental improvements. Ben Reitzes : Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Liz Stine : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. I just wanted to hit on the cloud titan vertical or cloud titan AI vertical now if I could. I think, Ita, one of your comments was down a little or something in the quarter. Could you just -- two parts here, talk a little bit about that comment? Is this just timing or are there some different market share dynamics there? And then, secondly, if you could talk a little bit about opportunities at other hyperscalers? I know that's something where there's been trial activity and potential and sounds like it might take a little while, but any updates on other cloud titans that could become larger customers? Thank you. Ita Brennan : Just in terms of cloud, I mean, it's going to be a good cloud year again in 2023 for us, I think, but we did come into the year saying we wanted, if we could to balance supply a little bit towards enterprise. And we have been doing that. There's been some -- you'll see it, it's not a huge mix shift, but there has been some mix shift towards enterprise when we can, and we're pleased that we've been able to do that. Anshul, I don't know if you want to take the other cloud. Anshul Sadana : Sure. Tim, the engagement with other cloud titans who are customers -- our customers is still very positive. They're good customers, as many of you know, in routed layers, backbone, WAN use cases as well. In the next week, we'll touch a little bit more on the whole build versus [by topic] (ph). Liz Stine : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey, ladies, and Anshul, great quarter. Just on the product side, you guys released a new 25 gig offering recently. I guess what's been the early feedback? What kind of differentiates down there? And Jayshree, just to clarify here, when you talk about that double-digit growth rate for next year and years beyond, are you talking about a multi-year CAGR or for '24 specifically and then for '25 and '26 and beyond? Just trying to clarify here. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : All right. Okay. Well, Anshul, you want to answer the product question first? Anshul Sadana : Sure. James, the recent announcement was the launch of our 25 gig ultra-low latency switches. These are the 7130 series. And now the whole world can upgrade the high-frequency trading infrastructure going from 10 to 25. That's very, very low latency. You're talking about, with cross point technology, you're talking about 7 nanoseconds. But we also now introduce layer 2, layer 3 features at about 100 to 130 nanoseconds. Jayshree Ullal : And Anshul, just to put this in perspective, back in the day, it used to be 500 nanoseconds, right? Anshul Sadana : That's right. It only keeps going down. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, faster than the speed of light. And James, just to give you a clarification, I was saying as a company, Ita and myself, Anshul, we're aiming for at least double digits in '24 and years beyond, but I wasn't making any forecasts for exact numbers. James Fish : Helpful. Thanks. Liz Stine : Thank you, James. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, ladies. Quick question on gross margin. Nice improvements there. Ita, maybe you can go into the details of how much room is there more to go? And I'm just kind of wondering with your customers now looking at your excellent financials and your recovering gross margins, what are the odds that pricing pressures start coming back? Something you probably have not seen much in the last couple of years since COVID, now that margins are normalizing, could prices come down potentially, perhaps even for the -- more specifically, to the larger customers of yours? Jayshree Ullal : Ittai, I'll just start by saying prices are always coming down. As we go from one feed factor to another, between the SerDes technology and the density, the dollar per gigabit is always coming down. So, pricing pressure doesn't change independent of our growth margin. We're always in competitive deals. Where the value really comes in, and again, as I alluded to this, is CapEx versus OpEx. We expect pricing to be reasonably stable, but we expect the operational cost to be significantly advantageous with Arista technology. The total, the TCO, because of singular cloud vision, because of our software-driven approach, because of the fact that we have single-digit vulnerabilities while our industry peers have 100 to 500 of them in a given five-year factor, these are all now paying -- customers and enterprises especially are very fatigued with the poor quality of our competitors and are paying a lot of attention to that and willing to pay for that quality. Anshul Sadana : Ittai, as Jayshree mentioned, I want to emphasize this. The market is very competitive and it has been ever since we started. The gross margin that we report is not the reason why customers try to negotiate price and the gross margin is simply a result of what we've been executing on. I think the [indiscernible]. Ittai Kidron : Very good, thank you. Liz Stine : Thank you, Ittai. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you would be able -- willing to comment on your customer concentration year-to-date. I appreciate it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but given sort of where you were in 2022, I'd just like to get a better understanding of what essentially the progress has been in 2023. And in that context, how big is enterprise as a percent of revenue this year, year-to-date versus where it was last year? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Simon, we're very proud of our customers, even if they're concentrated, we love it. And as you know, the last year, we had some outsized concentration. If I recall the numbers, Meta was at 26% and what was Microsoft, Ita? Ita Brennan : Microsoft was 17%. Jayshree Ullal : 16% or 17%. While we expect, due to many of the CapEx news you've seen and shift in AI spending, that it's possible they come down, but they're still going to be very strong north of 10% contributors to our 2023 results. And we continue to -- even as the denominator may get larger in the forthcoming years, we continue to look at them as two very important and strategic customers for us. Liz Stine : Thanks, Simon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Simon's question, maybe put it a little bit differently. So, if I think about your market sector trend update, how much of the shift to that 40% to 45% cloud and AI titans reflects the inclusion of new AI use cases going forward and the shift of Oracle combined with maybe some normalization at Meta and Microsoft? Can kind of help us think through the dynamics there? And if it looks like shares going to be unchanged with the enterprise and financials, does that suggest to you that those markets are going to grow comparably over the long-term across the cycle? Is that the right way to look at it? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, David, your analysis is really deep on this one. Let me just say how innocently we reported this, which is Oracle is a greater than $1 million installed server company right now. And both their cloud spend as OCI and AI is significant, both as a company and for Arista. But we're not making any assumptions and that will vary every year, of course, on the mix of Microsoft or Oracle or any other for that matter. We're simply saying AI is going to become such an important component of all our cloud types that it's now a combined vertical. Don't read too much more into it. Ita Brennan : Yeah, it's more of a forward-looking impact, to be honest. Historically, this doesn't really change the trends that we've been talking about previously. It's really more about the future and how do you think AI will impact these numbers going forward. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, AI is too small to impact as much right now, it's right, you know that. But as it starts to become important, then this combined will go north of the 39% we have normally forecast. David Vogt : Great. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and congrats. I know you don't want to talk about backlog, but can you give us a sense at what point or what time you think your book to bill will return back to 1 or greater than 1, or when will your lead times reach normalized level? And then I have a quick follow-up after that. Ita Brennan : We're definitely not going to talk about book to bill if we don't talk about backlog, Erik. So, look, I think honestly we're making improvements. Jayshree talked about how lead times are much improved, right? So, we'll continue to do that. That's a positive thing for the customers and for the business. And we're still not back to kind of the turn business that we had some time ago. We're making progress, but we're still out there. Jayshree Ullal : I'm very -- I just want to add that I'm very proud of the progress the team has made. When you look back a few years ago, we were short of components, we were making multi-year purchases. There was a risk of a very large exposure, because you can't get all these forecasts right. And then obviously the mix changes from time to time, especially with the cloud and AI. So, it's very hard to measure our business on book to bill and backlog at a given time. But if you have to look at it as an overall multi-year trend. Erik Suppiger : Can you comment then on just when will the lead times be at a normalized level? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, and I think we said this. It's been improving consistently and we expect it to be normalized just like our gross margins in 2024. Erik Suppiger : All right, very good. Thank you. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg. Your line is open. Woo Jin Ho : Oh, great. Thanks. I made the cut. Happy Halloween, folks. So, I think there was a mention on merchant silicon earlier in the Q&A. And one of your merchant silicon partners has actually moved up the stack towards a surface provider routing. I'm just curious if there's any intention on going after that piece if that chip is made available to you? Anshul Sadana : Sure. Woo Jin, I believe you are referring to the latest announcement at Broadcom on their 25.6T Jericho chip that was announced recently. Woo Jin Ho : Yeah, the Qumran3D. Anshul Sadana : Qumran3D, exactly. So, it's the same family, same features. And as you know, we've been a great partner of Broadcom for a long time, and we'll continue to build new products. This is not a new entry, so to speak. We've been building these products that can be used as switches or routers for a while, and the bandwidth just doubled going to now 25.6T. You can expect some products from us in the future with those variants as well, but really nothing really changes. Just innovation continues and merchant silicon continues to succeed. Jayshree Ullal : And the investments, Woo Jin, we have made in our routing stack over the last 10 years, I want to say, has just gotten better and stronger. Powering the internet, powering the cloud, powering the AI, these are hard problems. And they require thousands of engineers of investment to build the right VXLAN, BGP routing, EVPN, et cetera. So, it's not just the chip, it's how we enable the chip to do these complicated routing algorithms. Woo Jin Ho : Great. Thank you. Liz Stine : Thanks, Woo Jin. Thank you.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website, following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; Ita Brennan, Arista's outgoing Chief Financial Officer; and Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista's incoming Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31st, 2023. If you'd like a copy of this release, you can access it online from our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2024 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. 2023 has been another memorable year for Arista. We gave initial guidance of 25% year-over-year revenue growth and instead achieved well beyond that at 33.8%, driving revenue to $5.86 billion, coupled with a record non-GAAP earnings per share for the year of $6.94, up in excess of 50% annually. Back to some Q4 specifics. We delivered revenues of $1.54 billion for the quarter, with a non-GAAP record earnings per share of $2.08 due to a one-time favorable tax rate. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 17% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 65.4% was influenced by improving supply chain and greater enterprise mix. International contributions for the quarter registered at 22.3%, with the Americas at 77.7%. This was one of our strongest-performing international quarters in recent history. Shifting to annual sector revenue for 2023. Cloud titans contributed significantly at approximately 43%. Enterprises, including financials was strong at approximately 36%, while the providers were at 21%. Both Meta and Microsoft are greater than 10% customer concentration at 21% and 18%, respectively. Despite multiple CapEx reductions last year and the normal volatility of cloud titan and AI pivot, we cherish our privilege status with both M and M. Speaking of AI, in fall of 2023, Andy and I attended the 50th golden anniversary of Ethernet at the Computer History Museum. It truly is a reminder of how familiar and widely deployed Ethernet is with the speed increasing by orders of magnitude from a shared collision 2.95 megabits for file printed share to a terabit Ethernet switching in the AI and ML era. AI workloads are placing greater demand on Ethernet, as they are both data and compute-intensive across thousands of processes today. Basically, AI at scale needs Ethernet at scale. AI workloads cannot tolerate the delays in the network, because the job can only be completed after all flows are successfully delivered to the GPU clusters. All it takes is one culprit of worst-case link to throttle an entire AI workload. Three improvements are being pioneered by Arista and the founding members of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium to improve job completion time. Number one, packet spraying. AI network topology needs packet spraying to allow every flow to simultaneously access all parts of the destination. Arista's developing multiple forms of load balancing dynamically with our customers. Two is flexible ordering. Key to an AI job completion is the rapid and reliable bulk transfer with flexible ordering using Ethernet links to optimally balance AI-intensive operations, unlike the rigid ordering of InfiniBand. Arista is working closely with its leading vendors to achieve this. Finally, network congestion. In AI networks, there's a common incast congestion problem whereby multiple uncoordinated senders can send traffic to the receivers simultaneously. Arista's platforms are purpose-built and designed to avoid these kind of hotspots, evenly spreading the load across multi-packs across our virtual output queuing, VoQ lossless fabric. In terms of annual 2023 product lines, our core, which consists of cloud, AI and datacenter products, are built upon our highly differentiated Arista Extensible Operating software system stack. It is successfully deployed across 10, 25, 100, 200 and 400 gig speeds. Our cloud networking products deliver power-efficient, high availability zones without doubling the cost of redundancy as datacenters demand insatiable bandwidth capacity and network speeds for both the front-end and back-end storage and compute clusters. The core drove approximately 65% of our revenue. We continue to gain share in our highest performance switching of 100, 200 and 400 gig ports to obtain the number one position, at approximately 40-plus percent, according to industry analysts. We have increased our 400-gig customer base from 600 customers in 2022 to approximately 800 customers in 2023. We expect both 400 and 800 gigabit Ethernet will emerge as important pilots for AI back-end GPU clusters. We are cautiously optimistic about achieving our AI revenue goal of at least $750 million in AI networking in 2025. Our second market is network adjacencies comprised of routing, replacing routers and our cognitive campus workspaces. We continue to make progress in campus aiming for the $750 million revenue by 2025 that we have shared at many Analyst Days. Our investments in cognitive wired and wireless, zero-touch provisioning and the introduction of AGNI, Arista Guardian for Network Identity as well as AVA sensors for threat mitigation is resonating well with our campus customers. The post-pandemic campus is seeking network-as-a-service overlay and zero-trust network embedded in with high availability, observability and consistency across our OS and management domains. We are also successfully deployed in many routing edge and peering use cases. Just in 2023 alone, we introduced six EOS software releases across 600 new features and 50 platforms. In fall of 2023, we introduced our WAN routing system with a focus on scale, encryption and WAN transit routing capabilities. It has positioned us well, giving our customers a seamless enterprise LAN and WAN portfolio. The campus and routing adjacencies together contribute approximately 19% of revenue. Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, DANZ Monitoring Fabric or DMF observability and advanced threat sensors for network detection and response. Arista's subscription-based network services and software contributed approximately 16% of the total revenue. We surpassed 2,400 cumulative customers with CloudVision, pivotal to building a modern operating model for the enterprise. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are counted inside the core or adjacent markets. While 2023's headline has been mostly about AI we are pleased with the momentum of enterprise and provider customers as well. Arista continues to diversify its business globally with multiple use cases and verticals. We have more than doubled our enterprise revenue in the last three years and we are becoming the gold standard for client to cloud to AI networking with one EOS and one CloudVision foundation. Our million-dollar customer logos increased steadily in 2023 at approximately 35% as a direct result of our campus and enterprise momentum. Three principles continue to differentiate us as we are poised to be a market-share gainer in the enterprise. One, best-in-class, highly available proactive products with resilience and hitless upgrades at multiple levels. Two, zero-touch automation for predictive client-to-cloud one-click operations that relies less on human staff or manual operations and is instead software-driven. And finally, prescriptive insights based on AIML autonomous virtual assist AVA algorithms for increased security, observability and root cause analysis. Our foundational and network data lake architecture and the ability to gather, store and process multiple modalities of network data is the only way to reconcile all the incongruent silos for network operators. While legacy vendors that are 30 to 40 years old are aiming for consolidation, Arista remains the only pure-play networking innovator earning top spots in Forrester Wave's programmable switching and customer validation in Gartner's voice of customer for campus in 2023. In December 2023, we conducted one of our largest customer events called Innovate in Vegas. Well, not my most favorite location, our customers and prospects founded very exciting and compelling for their network transformation initiatives. They resonate deeply with our Arista 2.0 vision, building best-of-breed, data-driven networking platforms. In summary, as we wrap up another fantastic year in 2023, I am so proud of the team's execution across multiple dimensions. They have all worked tirelessly to improve our operational metrics such as lead times, gross margin and on-time shipments. Simply put, we outpaced the industry in quality, support and innovation. We set the direction for the future of networking, working intimately with our strategic customers. Despite limited visibility at this time, we reiterate our double-digit growth of 10% to 12% from Analyst Day, aiming for approximately $6.5 billion in 2024. With that, I'd like to turn it one last time to review our financial metrics with Ita Brennan. Ita? Ita Brennan : Thanks, Jayshree and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2023 results and our guidance for Q1 2024 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results are provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $1.54 billion, up 20.8% year-over-year and towards the upper end of our guidance of $1.50 to $1.55 billion. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 17% of revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 16.8% in Q3. International revenues for the quarter came in at $343.5 million, or 22.3% of total revenue, up from 21.5% last quarter. This quarter-over-quarter increase largely reflected a healthy contribution from our in-region EMEA customers. Overall gross margin in Q4 was 65.4%, well above our guidance of approximately 63%, and up from 63.1% last quarter. As a recap for the year, we continue to see incremental improvements in gross margin quarter-over-quarter with higher enterprise shipments and better supply chain costs, somewhat offset by the need for additional inventory reserves as customers refined their forecast product mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $262.7 million or 17.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at $255.6 million. R&D spending came in at $165 million or 10.7% of revenue, consistent with last quarter, reflecting lower level of new product introduction costs versus what we experienced in the first half of 2023 and what we expect for the first half of 2024. This reflects the timing of prototype and other costs associated with the development of next-generation products. Sales and marketing expenses were $83.4 million or 5.4% of revenue, up from $79 million last quarter, with increases -- increased sales compensation and travel costs. Our G&A costs came in at $14.3 million or 0.9% of revenue, up from $12.1 million last quarter, reflecting some seasonal fourth-quarter spending. Our operating income for the quarter was $744 million or 48.3% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $54.5 million and our effective tax rate was 16.8%. This slower-than-normal quarterly tax rate reflected the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of the statute limitations and some true-up of jurisdictional earnings mix. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $664.3 million or 43.1% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 318.85 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.08, up 47.5% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock in the quarter. To recap our repurchase program to date, we have repurchased $855.5 million or 8 million shares at an average price of $107 per share under our current $1 billion Board authorization. This leaves $144.5 million available for repurchase in future quarters. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, stock price, and other factors. Now turning to operating cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $526.5 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance combined with some increase in deferred revenue offset by reductions in taxes payable. DSOs came in at 61 days, up from 51 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of shipments and seasonal strength in service renewal billings. Inventory turns were 0.07 times, down slightly to 1.1 last quarter. Inventory increased slightly to $1.95 billion, reflecting the ongoing receipt and consumption of components from our purchase commitments and an increase in switch-related finished goods. Our purchase commitments at the end of the quarter were $1.59 billion, down from $2 billion at the end of Q3. We expect to continue to reduce our overall purchase commitment number. However, we will maintain a healthy position related to key components, especially as we focus on new products. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1.51 billion, up from $1.195 billion in Q3. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenue balance increased approximately $153 million over last quarter. This was ahead of our expectations for the quarter and yet again shows that this balance can move significantly on a quarterly basis. As of now, we expect this balance to decline somewhat in Q1 '24, but still be up significantly from Q3 '23 levels. Accounts payable days were 72 days, up from 44 days in Q3 and second, the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6 million. I would now like to turn the call back to Jayshree. Jayshree? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ita, first of all, for an incredible eight and a half years as our Chief Financial Officer. We're going to miss you a lot and wish you all the best in your next innings. And if you ever miss an earnings call, please come, we'll invite you for one. Now, to describe our Q1 2024 guidance, it's my pleasure to introduce our incoming Chief Financial Officer, Chantelle Breithaupt for her very first earnings call at Arista. Welcome, Chantelle. Chantelle Breithaupt : Thank you, Jayshree. Ita, congratulations on all that you've achieved during your tenure with Arista. Your partnership during our transition is greatly appreciated. Since joining Arista, I've been impressed by both the outstanding leadership team and the highly innovative engineering team who both serve a set of marquee customers that are redefining the future of networking. Arista began shipping products in 2008 and in 15 years, the annual bandwidth of the datacenters has grown 350 overall. In just the past two years, the annual bandwidth has doubled with Arista shipping a cumulative 75 million ports in that timeframe. Our acceleration of the data center switching market in recent quarters is evidenced by our market-share gains in the 20-plus percent range of both ports and dollars. I am thrilled to be joining Arista in such an exciting time. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 and the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain confident with our Analyst Day view which calls for fiscal year 2024 revenue growth of 10% to 12%. This reflects our outlook for moderated cloud spending after multiple years of accelerated growth combined with a continued growth trajectory in the enterprise business. For gross margin, we reiterate the range for the fiscal year of 62% to 64%, with Q1 '24 expected to be at the lower end due to a heavier cloud mix including some expected release of deferred revenue. In terms of spending, we expect to invest in gross spending faster than revenue. In line with our Analyst Day view, with an operating margin of approximately 42% in 2024. This incremental investment may include go-to-market resourcing and increased new product introduction costs to support our product roadmap. This latter trend is already evident in Q1 \u201824 as R&D is expected to rebound from the unusually low levels in the second-half of 2023. On the cash front we will continue to work to reduce our working capital investments and drive some further reduction in inventory as we move through the year. Our structural tax rate is expected to remain at 21.5%, back to the usual historical rate up from the unusually low one-type rate of 16.8% experienced last quarter Q4 FY '23. With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first-quarter, which is based on our non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows. Revenues of approximately $1.52 billion to $1.56 billion, gross margin of approximately 62%, and operating margin at approximately 42%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with approximately 319.5 million diluted shares. In summary, I am excited to lead Arista 2.0 journey as CFO. We will migrate our best of breed products to best of breed data-driven platforms, enabling our impressive TAM of $60 billion. With that, I now turn the call back to Liz for Q&A. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Chantelle. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the Arista earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And, Ita, it's been great working with you. Wish you the best in retirement. I guess my question is, Jayshree, just obviously the focus on AI and the build-out of the backend networks based on 400 and 800 gig ethernet, I'm just curious, like, as we progressed through these last three months, how has your views evolved? And just remind us of the cadence of kind of product cycles that really set the table for risk in this AI opportunity as we move through \u201824 and particularly into \u201925? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Aaron. And yes, we will all miss, Ita. So our AI performance continues to track well for the $750 million revenue goal that we set last November at Analyst Day. To give you some color on the last three months, I would say, difficult to project anything in three months. But if I look at the last year, which may be - the last 12 months, is a better indication we have participated in a large number of AI bids. When I say large, I should say they're large AI bids, but they're a small number of customers actually to be more clear. And in the last four out of five AI networking clusters we have participated on Ethernet versus InfiniBand, Arista has won all four of them for Ethernet, one of them still stays on InfiniBand. So these are very high-profile customers. We are pleased with this progress. But as I said before, last year was the year of trials. This is the year of pilots. And true production truly sets in only in 2025. Operator : Great. Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi. I'm trying to find a -- because we don't have the backlog contribution of last year, I'm trying to kind of dissect the numbers and see what's the correlation with core data center business and traditional compute? So if server sales cycle is low and we see some declines in servers, does it mean that at least in the short run, excluding the backlog contribution, there is also a decline in the orders? Just how does it work between server demand and switching demand? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. So, Tal, first of all, as you know, Ita and I, or Chantelle and I, would never really comment on bookings, orders. We find these all to be kind of useless metrics, because ultimately what matters is what we ship, which is revenue. But just to sort of answer your question on ratio of CPUs, or for that matter, GPUs in the future to the network, typically, we have to have the CPUs or GPUs come in before we can outfit the network. They kind of go hand in hand, but as you know, in AI, we've been waiting for the GPUs and in the last couple of years, they've been waiting for everything with a long lead time. But I would say generally in the leaf architecture, they go hand in hand where you have to create a rack of 1,000 servers or whether they're CPUs and GPUs. And generally they look to rack and stack the cable, the CPUs and the network together. On the spine, which connects all of our leaf, that decision can be made independently even if the processors are not available. So on the leaf, it's more correlated, on the spine it's not. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sebastian Naji from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sebastian Naji : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to start and echo everyone's commentary and wish you the best, Ita. It's been a pleasure. My question has to do with white box. People have been talking about the threat for white box since Arista's been around and it hasn't really impacted Arista's ability to grow. Can you maybe articulate why you believe in the world of AI networks? More of the market would not move to white box or vice versa maybe why more of the market would move away from white box? Jayshree Ullal : It's a good question, Sebastian, Thank you. Look, I think white box is here to stay for a very long time if somebody just wants a throwaway commodity product. But how many people want throwaway commodity in the data center? They're so mission critical. And they're even more mission critical for AI. If I'm going to spend multi-million dollars on a GPU cluster, then the last thing I'm going to do is put a toy network in, right? So to put this sort of in perspective, we will continue to coexist with the white box. There will be use cases where Arista's blue box or a standalone white box can run either SONiC or FBOSS, but many times the EOS software stack is really, really something they depend on for availability, analytics, automation. And there's -- you can get your network for zero cost, but the cost of downtime is millions and millions of dollars. So we have always embraced white box, we coexist with it, but it continues to be a relatively small use case in the larger mission critical data centers for enterprise and cloud companies. Liz Stine : Thanks, Sebastian. Sebastian Naji : Thank you, Jayshree. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Niknam : Hey, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a higher level strategy question. We've seen two of your key networking peers scale up through sizable M&A over the last several months. So, can you talk a little bit about how you view the value of such scale in order to maybe better serve and target both the cloud and AI titan as well as enterprise verticals? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah, no, but Matt, that's a good question. I think on the cloud and AI, we feel pretty bulked up to deal with those customers because they don't look for size and bulk, they look for, as you know, networking innovation capabilities and this has been Arista's heritage for 10 years and will continue to be with the AI cycle for the next foreseeable 10 years. On the enterprise there are multiple markets and size helps. I think if you are targeting the early adopters, Arista has traditionally done very, very well there. And the last three years is a good example of how well we've done there, both in the data center and in the campus. If you look at the next category of sort of the, not necessarily the screaming early adopters, but maybe the fast followers, I think Arista will continue to do well there in the large enterprise. We are so underserved and under penetrated in both the Fortune 1000 and the Global 2000. We got a long, long ways to go. We probably have 20% of those customers. We've got 80% of them left to go. And I'm not even talking about the mid-market and the SMB, which is a whole other market that we are underserved in. So absolutely, we need to make more investments in enterprise there. When I look at what Anshul, Chris Schmidt, Ashwin are doing, this is exactly where we're doubling down. This is exactly where we doubled down in the last three years post pandemic. And we have more than doubled our revenue and increased our logo presence because of this investment in the enterprise. I can't comment about consolidation of vendors, but when vendors don't grow, five plus five sometimes is 10. But to be careful on integration, five plus five can sometimes be seven too. So that's somebody else's responsibility, not mine. I think we can get a lot of organic growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Jayshree, maybe just a question. You noted limited visibility and understand that this early during the year. But would you say that it's timing of when some of these back-end pilots scale into production, is it kind of level of front-end spending? Is it enterprise projects? Just like where you're finding just more commentary on the visibility comment? And then second question, you guys noted on the gross margin, but it's a portion of mix and kind of supply chain costs coming down. But just, if there's any one bias towards what led to the gross margin upside in the quarter. Thanks. Ita Brennan : Yeah, maybe I'll take that last one first. I mean a lot of the upside in the fourth quarter was really just customer mix, right? I mean we were weighted heavily towards enterprise in Q4, not for any particular reason. It just happened to be that way and that kind of dropped the margins higher. Jayshree Ullal : And, Meta, to answer your question on enterprise and AI activity, I think Arista continues to drive the concept of EOS, multi-domain routing, campus, high availability, mission-critical enterprises for multiple verticals. We're making good progress there and this is going to be the part of our mainstream innovation and go-to-market. On the AI side, we continue to track well. I think we're moving from what I call trials, which is connecting hundreds of GPUs to pilots, which is connecting thousands of GPUs this year, and then we expect larger production clusters. I think one of the questions that we will be asking ourselves and our customers is how these production clusters evolve? Is it going to be 400, 800 or a combination thereof? The role of Ultra Ethernet Consortium and standards and the ecosystem all coming together, very similar to how we had these discussions in 400 gig will also play a large part. But we're feeling pretty good about the activity. And I think moving from trials to pilots this year will give us considerable confidence on next year's number. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe, Ita, for you, and I'll miss having you on here, by the way, congrats on retirement. Ita Brennan : Thank you. James Fish : But what's causing the delay being able to ship that we saw that product deferred revenue jump as much as we did or should we think about this as normal to see this level of jump in Q4 is based on what you've disclosed in the past? It doesn't seem like this is a normal jump. I guess what's the hang-up and with supply chain starting to go the other way, it's quite more readily available. Could we actually see the price increases you guys have enacted in the past now have to be given back at some point in '24 or '25? Ita Brennan : Yeah, Jim, I think the deferred, if you think back to how this works, I mean obviously, it's been shipped for it to actually be in deferred, right? So I think that's -- it's just timing. And we've talked about this over the past. I'm sure Chantelle is going to talk about it again, in the future, right, is that it really is just purely timing of shipments and where we have some new type projects, new capabilities that we're trialing with the customer, that's causing it to get caught in the deferred. But it's not a fundamental underlying driver of the business. I think on pricing and the very little that's happening in terms of pricing adjustments, that's kind of out of the order, just normal pricing environment where we continue to compete for business. I don't think there's anything particularly different there that we've seen. James Fish : Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and congrats to you as well, Ita, I'll miss you. And, Chantelle, good luck, of course, to you in your new role. I guess a couple ones for me. First of all, on the cloud mix, it kind of declined a little bit on the year. Maybe you can tell us what are your underlying working assumptions for '24? And then more broadly on the '24 guide, Chantelle, Ita, it feels like you're talking about $600 million increase year-over-year in revenue. It feels like half of it can already come from the AI networking, given your '25 targets, and you seem very comfortable about your '25 targets, and I would think your '24 should be comfortable as well. So why -- if I assume that $200 million, $300 million come from AI networking this year, why should the rest of the business generate only $300 million to get to your annual targets? Why such an aggressive conservatism here on the guide? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, Ita, let me take the first question, and then I'll pass it over to Ita and Chantelle for what you call conservatism. So first of all, our cloud mix is very strong, very good. But I think what you should take away from this is not that our cloud mix came down, but our enterprise did really, really well. And since 100% is the total pie when something does really well, then the others look less so. So we're doing well on all three sectors and we're very proud of the enterprise momentum. AI is going to come. It is yet to come -- certainly in 2023, as I've said to you many, many times, it was a very small part of our number, but it will gradually increase. Okay, which of one of my fantastic CFOs wants to take the conservatism question? Chantelle Breithaupt : I'll start the [indiscernible], thank you for the well wishes. I think coming into 2024, it's a balanced view in the sense that we want to have multiple options to get to our year and so we'll work through what those mixes are and how to get to that performance that we've laid out for our guidance. I think that Jayshree very eloquently put in the sense of '23, '24, '25 on what we expect from AI going from trials to pilots to production. And so we'll work through what that means in 2024. But I think to change anything in Q1 at this time, we're just going to go a quarter at a time, especially with me coming in and we'll see how the year progresses. Ittai Kidron : All right. Good luck. Chantelle Breithaupt : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Henderson : Ita, I can't believe you're leaving us. I'm going to miss you. Go ahead. Jayshree Ullal : No, she said she will miss you. Alex Henderson : I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. Ita Brennan : Go ahead, Alex. Ask your question. Alex Henderson : So, the question I have really is what are you hearing from the field, particularly in the enterprise segment. There's been a lot of noise about indigestion of large amounts of volume that have been shipped to various companies. And clearly, there's some concern that there's some oversupply over the last year into the enterprise market. And I think you've talked to a lot of CEOs. What are they telling you in terms of where their IT spending intentions are for '24? Where are they saying the spending is going relative to the networking gear versus alternative spending priorities? Thanks. Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question, Alex. I certainly talk to a lot of CIOs and CEOs. And if I rewind the clock to January last year, I think price was a lot spookier then. We were going through this whole financial crisis, Silicon Valley Bank, this, that, the other. And if I now fast forward to a year later, our momentum in the enterprise is actually stronger now than it was a year ago. So all this [Technical Difficulty] customers are looking for that innovation, modern network model, CI/CD principles, bringing DevOps, NetOps, SecOps, all of this together. And so Arista continues, in my view, with the large TAM we have in the enterprise of at least $30 billion out of that $60 billion to find the opportunity to really deliver that vision of client to cloud, break down the operational silos. And I would say today, the CIOs recognize us as the pure-play innovator more than any other company. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Thank you for taking my question. Jayshree, thanks for providing that comments on the four wins against InfiniBand. Now your networking competitor announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on Ethernet AI enterprise solutions last week. Can you talk about what this means for your Ethernet back-end business, if anything? Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. I don't understand the announcement as well as probably my competitor does. I think it has more to do with UCS and Cisco validated designs. Specific to our partnership, you can be assured that we'll be working with the leading GPU vendors. And as you know, NVIDIA has 90% or 95% of the market. So, Jensen and I are going to partner closely. It is vital to get a complete AI network design going. We will also be working with our partners in AMD and Intel. So we will be the Switzerland of XPUs, whatever the GPU might be, and we look to supply the best network ever. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. Yeah, Ita, going to miss you as well, good luck. So I wanted to follow up a little bit more on that AI, Jayshree. You talked about those wins. Could you just talk a little bit about -- a little bit more color there. Do you think these deployments are going to be more sole-sourced or will there be multiple vendors? Did you face kind of a different competitive landscape than normal in these? And what are you thinking about breadth of this business? I'm sure it's a lot of the really large customers as you said right now. But can you talk a little bit about how you see this moving into whether it's other service providers or the enterprise vertical? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Okay. So let me just step back and say the first real consultative approach from Arista is to provide our expertise on how to build a robust back-end AI network. And so the whole discussion of Ethernet become -- versus InfiniBand becomes really important because as you may recall, a year ago, I told you we were outside looking in, everybody had an Ethernet -- everybody had an InfiniBand HPC cluster that was kind of getting bundled into AI. But a lot has changed in a year. And the popular product we are seeing right now as the back-end cluster for our AI is the Arista 7800 AI spine, which in a single chassis with north of 500 terabits of capacity can give you a substantial number of ports, 400 or 800. So you can connect up to 1,000 GPUs just doing that. And that kind of data parallel scale-out can improve the training time dimensions, large LLMs, massive integration of training data. And of course, as we shared with you at the Analyst Day, we can expand that to a two-tier AI leaf and spine with a 16-way CMP to support close to 10,000 GPUs nonblocking. This lossless architecture for Ethernet and then the overlay we will have on that with the Ultra Ethernet Consortium in terms of congestion controls, packet spring and working with a suite of UEC mix is what I think will make Ethernet the default standard for AI networking going forward. Now will it be sole source [indiscernible], I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that our cloud networking isn't sole sourced. So probably our AI won't be too. But today's models are moving very rapidly, relying on a high bandwidth, predictable latency, the focus on application performance requires you to be sole sourced initially. And over time, I'm sure it'll move to multiple sources, but I think Arista is very well positioned for the first innings of AI networking, just like we were for the cloud networking decade. And one other thing I want to say is, although a lot of these customers are doing AI pivots, these AI pivots will result in revisiting the front-end cloud network, too. So this AI anatomy is being really well understood. And if you take a deep look at the center piece of it, which is all the GPUs, they have to connect to something very reliable and this is really where we come in. And so this -- being actively involved has -- is going to pay a lot of dividends, but we're still very much in our first innings of AI. Tim Long : Great. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks for the question. And obviously, Ita, it's been great working with you. Thanks for all you've done for us. I wanted to ask about your guidance and the conservatism from another lens here. With regard to 2024, since your November 9 Analyst Day, some things have changed. Microsoft, Meta and Google have all raised their CapEx forecast for 2024. Obviously, your guidance for 2024 stays the same, and I know you're usually conservative. And then for 2025, AMD upped their TAM very significantly for AI and -- by a multiple. And I guess they're seeing something that many of us are seeing with regard to the future demand. And you've kept your guidance at $750 million. I just -- with that backdrop and the changes since November 9 and you guys keeping your guidance, and I understand you're conservative, do you mind addressing your conservativism or your guidance from those lenses, both with regard to '24 and '25, Jayshree? Jayshree Ullal : So, Ben, I'm going to let my two CFOs speak to the conservatism, and then I'll add more color, how about that? Who wants to go first? Ben Reitzes : Okay, great. Chantelle Breithaupt : Hey, Ben. Nice to meet you. It\u2019s Chantelle. I think that change from November to January, February time frame, I don't think would change our guidance on the year. Kind of similar to the question before. I think that our guide right now resembles where we think we're at in the sense of what will materialize in '24, we'll take it one quarter at a time. The reflections of the changes you're mentioning, the timing of that, we have to wait and see. There's no guarantee that's within our 12-month guidance time frame, and we'll watch and wait and see, but Jayshree? Ita Brennan : Yeah. I think that says it all. I mean, all the drivers that you mentioned are great drivers, the timing of everything that's always complex, right? So we'll take it a quarter at time and see how things play out. Jayshree Ullal : And look, if our conservatism changes to more optimism in the second half or more likely in 2025, we'll keep you posted. Ben Reitzes : All right. Thanks a lot. Take care. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you for squeezing me in. Good evening from Paris. So there have been several companies with the optimal supply chain that indicate the market for 800 gig and early deployments of 1.6T ports will begin to inflect later this year for actually front-end networks. And so I guess why would I be wrong to conclude that your hardware sales would be a leading indicator of that? And I guess, as a result, shouldn't cloud titan revenue grow at least in line with your outlook for 2024 of double-digit growth? Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Yeah. Thank you, Karl. Again, I'll step -- history is a good indicator of future. And if you look at our 400-gig, everybody asked me the same question. They said, how come 400 gig isn\u2019t taking off in 2019 or '20? And it turned out it took our ecosystem several years and of course, the pandemic didn't help when it was optics or NICs for the whole entire thing to come together. And I don't doubt we will have trials for 800 gig this year, but I think real production, 800 gig will happen in 2025. I'd like to be proven wrong and maybe it'll come in sooner in which case, like I said, we'll let you know. But at the moment, this is our best case prediction. Liz Stine : Thanks, Karl. This concludes the Arista Networks Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We have posted a presentation, which provides additional information on our results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Arista.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; and Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2024. If you would like a copy of this release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2024 and beyond. Our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.  These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Amidst all the network consolidation, Arista is looking to establish ourselves as the pure-play networking innovator, for the next era, addressing at least a $60 billion TAM in data-driven client-to-cloud AI networking.  In terms of Q1 specifics, we delivered revenue of $1.57 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.99. Services and Software Support Renewals contributed strongly at approximately 16.9% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins of 64.2% was influenced by improved supply chain and inventory management, as well as favorable mix of the enterprise.  International contribution for the quarter registered at 20% and with the Americas strong at 80%. As we kick off 2024, I'm so proud of the Arista team work and our consistent execution. We have been fortunate to build a seasoned management team for the past 10 to 15 years. Our core founders are very engaged in the company for the past 20 years. Ken is still actively programming and writing code, while Andy is our full-time chief architect for next-generation AI, silicon and optics initiatives. Hugh Holbrook, our recently promoted Chief Development Officer, is driving our major platform initiatives in tandem, with John McCool and Alex on the hardware side.  This engineering team is one of the best in tech and networking that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. On behalf of Arista though, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for Anshul Sadana's 16-plus wonderful years of instrumental service to the company in a diverse set of roles. I know he will always remain a well-wisher and supporter of the company. But Anshul, I'd like to invite you to say a few words. Anshul Sadana : Thank you, Jayshree. The Arista journey has been a very special one. We've come a long way from our startup base to over an $80 billion company today. Every milestone, every event, the ups and downs are all etched in my mind.  I've had a multitude of roles and learned and grown more than what I could have ever imagined. I have decided to take a break and spend more time with family, especially when the kids are young. I'm also looking at exploring different areas in the future. I want to thank all of you on the call today, our customers, our investors, our partners and all the well wishes over these years. Arista isn't just a workplace. It's family to me. It's the people around you that make life fun. Special thanks to Arista leadership, Chris, Ashwin, John McCool, Mark Foss, Ita and Chantelle, Marc Taxay, Hugh Holbrook, Ken Duda and many more. Above all, there are 2 very special people I want to thank. Andy Bechtolsheim for years of vision, passion, guidance and listening to me. And of course, Jayshree. She hasn't been just my manager, but also by mentor and coach for over 15 years. Thank you for believing in me. I will always continue to be an Arista well-wisher. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Anshul, thank you for that very genuine and hard-sell expression of your huge contributions to Arista. It gives me goosebumps hearing your nostalgic memories. We will miss you and hope someday you will return back home.  At this time, Arista will not be replacing the COO role and instead flattening the organization. We will be leveraging our deep bench strength of our executives who stepped up to drive our new Arista 2.0 initiatives. In particular, John McCool, our Chief Platform Officer; and Ken Kiser, our Group Vice President, have taken standard responsibility for our cloud, AI, tech initiatives, operations and sales.  On the noncloud side, 2 seasoned executives have been promoted Ashwin Kohli, Chief Customer Officer; and Chris Schmidt, Chief Sales Officer, will together address the global enterprise and provider opportunity. Our leaders have grown up in Arista for a long time with long tenures of a decade or more.  We are quite pleased with the momentum across all our 3 sectors : Cloud and AI Titans, Enterprise and Providers. Customer activity is high as Arista continues to impress our customers and prospects with our undeniable focus on quality and innovation. As we build our programmable network on delays based on our Universal Leaf/Spine topology, we are  are also constructing network, as I said, the suite of overlays such as zero-touch automation, security, telemetry and observability. I would like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder, CTO and recently elected to the Arista Board to describe our enterprise NaaS strategy, as we drive to our enterprise campus goal of $750 million in 2025.  Over to you, Ken. Kenneth Duda : Thank you, Jayshree, and thanks, everyone, for being here. I'm Ken Duda, CTO of Arista Networks. Excited to talk to you today about NetDL, the Arista Network Data Link and how it supports our Network-as-a-Service strategy.  From the inception of networking decades ago, networking has involved rapidly changing data. Data about how the network is operating, which paths through the network our best and how the network is being used. But historically, most of this data was to simply discarded as the network changes state and that which was collected can be difficult to interpret because it lacks context. Network addresses and port numbers by themselves, provide a little insight into what users are doing or experiencing.  Recent developments in AI have proved the value of data. But to take advantage of these breakthroughs, you need to gather and store large data sets, labeled suitably for machine learning. Arista is solving this problem with NetDL, we continually monitor every device, not simply taking snapshots, but rather streaming every network event, every counter, every piece of data in real time, archiving a full history in NetDL.  Alongside this device data, we also collect flow data and inbound network telemetry data gathered by our switches. Then we enrich this performance data further with user, service and application layer data from external sources outside the network, enabling us to understand not just how each part of the network is performing, but also which users are using the network for what purposes. And how the network behavior is influencing their experience.  NetDL is a foundational part of the EOS stack, enabling advanced functionality across all of our use cases. For example, in AI fabrics, NetDL enables fabric-wide visibility, integrating network data and NIC data to enable operators to identify misconfigurations or misbehaving hosts and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. But for this call, I want to focus on how NetDL enables Network-as-a-Service. Network-as-a-Service or NaaS is Arista's strategy for up-leveling our relationship with our customers, taking us beyond simply providing network hardware and software by also providing customers or service provider partners with tools for building and operating services. The customer selects the service model, configure service instances and Arista's CV NaaS handles the rest, equipment selection, deployment, provisioning, building, monitoring and troubleshooting.  In addition, CV NaaS provides end user self-service, enabling customers to manage their service systems, provision new endpoints, provision new virtual topologies, set traffic prioritization policies, set access rules and get visibility into their use of the service and its performance. One can think of NaaS as applying cloud computing principles to the physical network, reusable design patterns, scale autonomous operations, multi-tenant from top to bottom with cost-effective automated end user self service.  And we couldn't get to the starting line without NetDL, as NetDL provides a database foundation of NaaS service deployment and monitoring. Now NaaS is not a separate SKU, but really refers to a collection of functions in audition. For example, Arista Validated Designs or AVD, is a provisioning system. It's an early version of our NaaS Service Instance Configuration tool. Our AGNI services provide global location independent identity management needed to identify customers within NaaS. Our UNO product or Universal Network Observability, will ultimately become the service monitoring element of NaaS. And finally, our NaaS solution has security integrated through our ZTN or Zero Trust Networking product that we showcased at RSA this week.  Thus, our NaaS vision simultaneously represents a strategic business opportunity for us, while also serving as a guiding principle for our immediate CloudVision development efforts. While we are really excited about the future here, our core promise to our investors and customers is unchanging and uncompromised we will always put all these first. We are incredibly proud of the amount of success customers have had deploying our products because they really work. And as we push hard building sophisticated new functions in the NetDL and NaaS areas, we will never put our customers' networks at risk by cutting corners on quality. Thank you. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ken, for your tireless execution in the typical Arista way. In an era characterized by stringent cybersecurity, observability is an essential perimeter and imperative. We cannot secure what we cannot see. We launched CloudVision and UNO in February 2024 based on the EOS Network Data Link Foundation that Ken just described for universal network observability. CloudVision UNO delivers fall detection, correction and recovery. It also brings deep analysis to provide a composite picture of the entire network with improved discovery of applications, hosts, workloads and IT systems of record.  Okay. Switching to AI. Of course, no call is complete without that. As generative AI training tasks evolve, they are made up of many thousands of individual iterations. Any slowdown due to network and critically impact the application performance, creating inefficient wait stage and idling away processor performance by 30% or more.  The time taken to reach coherence known, as job completion time is an important benchmark achieved by building proper scale-out AI networking to improve the utilization of these precious and expensive GPUs. Arista continues to have customer success across our innovative AI for networking platforms.  In a recent blog from one of our large Cloud and AI Titan customers, Arista was highlighted for building a 24,000 node GPU cluster based on our flagship 7,800 AI Spine. This cluster tackles complex AI training tasks that involve a mix of model and data penalization across thousands of processors and ethernet is proving to offer at least 10% improvement of job completion performance across all packet sizes versus InfiniBand.  We are witnessing an inflection of AI networking and expect this to continue throughout the year and decade. Ethernet is emerging as a critical infrastructure across both front-end and back-end AI data centers. AI applications simply cannot work in isolation and demand seamless communication among the compute nodes, consisting of back-end GPUs and AI accelerators and as well as the front end nodes like the CPUs, alongside storage and IP/WAN systems as well.  If you recall, in February, I shared with you that we are progressing well in 4 major AI Ethernet clusters, that we won versus InfiniBand recently. In all 4 cases, we are now migrating from trials to pilots, connecting thousands of GPUs this year, and we expect production in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs in 2025. Ethernet at scale is becoming the de facto network at premier choice for scale-out AI training workloads.  A good AI network needs a good data strategy, delivered by our highly differentiated EOS and network data lake architecture. We are, therefore, becoming increasingly constructive about achieving our AI target of $750 million in 2025.  In summary, as we continue to set the direction of Arista 2.0 networking, our visibility to new AI and cloud projects is improving and our enterprise and provider activity continues to progress well. We are now projecting above our Analyst Day range of 10% to 12% annual growth in 2024. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chantelle for the very first time as Arista's CFO, to review financial specifics and tell us more. Warm welcome to you, Chantelle. Chantelle Breithaupt : Thank you, Jayshree, and good afternoon. The analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2024 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.  Total revenues in Q1 were $1.571 billion, up 16.3% year-over-year and above the upper end of our guidance of $1.52 billion to $1.56 billion. This year-over-year growth was led by strength in the enterprise vertical with cloud doing well as expected.  Services and subscription software contributed approximately 16.9% of revenue in the first quarter, down slightly from 17% in Q4. International revenues for the quarter came in at $316 million or 20.1% of total revenue, down from 22.3% in the last quarter. This quarter-over-quarter reduction reflects the quarterly volatility and includes the impact of an unusually high contribution from our EMEA in-region customers in the prior quarter.  In addition, we continue to see strong revenue growth in the U.S. with solid contributions from our Cloud Titan and Enterprise customers. Gross margin in Q1 was 64.2%, above our guidance of approximately 62%. This is down from 65.4% last quarter and up from 60.3% in Q1 FY '23. The year-over-year margin accretion was driven by 3 key factors : Supply chain productivity gains led by the efforts of John McCool, Mike Capes and his operational team, a stronger mix of Enterprise business and a favorable revenue mix between product, services and software.  Operating expenses for the quarter were $265 million or 16.9% of revenue, up from last quarter at $262.7 million. R&D spending came in at $164.6 million or 10.5% of revenue, down slightly from $165 million last quarter. This reflected increased head count offset by lower new product introduction costs in the period due to timing of prototypes and other costs associated with our next-generation products.  Sales and marketing expense was $83.7 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared to $83.4 million last quarter, with increased head count costs offset by discretionary spending that is delayed until later this year. Our G&A costs came in at $16.7 million or 1.1% of revenue, up from 0.9% of revenue in the prior quarter. Income from operations for the quarter was $744 million or 47.4% of revenue.  Other income for the quarter was $62.6 million, and our effective tax rate was 20.9%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $637.7 million or 40.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 319.9 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.99, up 39% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $5.45 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $62.7 million of our common stock. And in April, we repurchased an additional 82 million for a total of $144.7 million at an average price of $269.80 per share. We have now completed share repurchases under our existing $1 billion Board authorization, whereby we repurchased 8.5 million shares at an average price of $117.20 per share. In May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.2 billion stock repurchase program, which commences in May 2024 and expires in May 2027. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent upon market and business conditions, stock price and other factors.  Now turning to operating cash performance for the first quarter. We generated approximately $513.8 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance, partially offset by ongoing investments in working capital. DSLs Came in at 62 days, up from 61 days in Q4 driven by significant end of quarter service renewals. Inventory turns were 1, flat to last quarter. Inventory increased slightly to $2 billion in the quarter, up from $1.9 billion in the prior period, reflecting the receipt of components from our purchase commitments and an increase in switch-related finished goods.  Our purchase commitments at the end of the quarter were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion at the end of Q4. We expect this number to level off as lead times continue to improve but will remain somewhat volatile as we ramp up new product introductions. Our total deferred revenue balance was $1.663 billion, up from $1.506 billion in Q4 of fiscal year 2023. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  Our product deferred revenue balance decreased by approximately $25 million versus last quarter. We expect 2024 to be a year of significant new product introductions, new customers and expanded use cases. These trends may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increase the volatility of our product deferred revenue balances.  As mentioned in prior quarters, the deferred balance can move significantly on a quarterly basis independent of underlying business drivers. Accounts payable days were 36 days, down from an unusually high 75 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.4 million.  Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. I have now had a quarter working with Jayshree, the leadership team and the broader Arista ecosystem, and I am excited about both our current and long-term opportunities in the markets that we serve. The passion for innovation, our agile business operating model and employee commitment to our customers' success are foundational. We are pleased with the momentum being demonstrated across the segments, Enterprise, Cloud and Providers.  With this, we are raising our revenue guidance to an outlook of 12% to 14% growth for fiscal year 2024. On the gross margin front, given the expected end customer mix combined with continued operational improvements, we remain with the fiscal year 2024 outlook of 62% to 64%.  Now turning to spending and investments. We continue to monitor both the overall macro environment and overall market opportunities. which will inform our investment prioritization as we move through the year. This will include a focus on targeted hires and leadership roles, R&D and the go-to-market team as we see opportunities to acquire strong talent.  On the cash front, while we will continue to focus on supply chain and working capital optimization, we expect some continued growth in inventory on a quarter-by-quarter basis, as we receive components from our purchase commitments. With these sets of conditions and expectations, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion, gross margin of approximately 64% and operating margin at approximately 44%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 320.5 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz for Q&A. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Chantelle. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Unknown Analyst : It's Adrienne for Atif. I was hoping you could comment on your raised expectations for the full year with regards to customer mix it sounds like from your gross margin guidance, you're seeing a higher contribution from Enterprise, but I was hoping you could comment on the dynamics you're seeing with your Cloud Titans. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So as Chantelle and I described, when we gave our guidance in November, we didn't have much visibility beyond 3 to 6 months, and so we had to go with that. The activity in Q1 alone, and I believe it will continue in the first half, has been much beyond what we expected. And this is true across all 3 sectors, Cloud and AI Titans, Providers and Enterprise. So we're feeling good about all 3 and therefore, have raised our guidance earlier than we probably would have done in May. I think we would have ideally liked to look at 2 quarters, Chantelle, what do you think, but I think we felt good enough. Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. No, I think we saw because of the diversified momentum and the mix of the momentum that gave us confidence. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess, Jayshree and Chantelle, I appreciate the sort of raise in guidance for the full year here. But when I look at it on a half-over-half basis in terms of what you're implying. If I'm doing the math correct, you're implying about a sort of 5%, 6% half-over-half growth, which when I go back and look at previous years, you're -- probably there's only 1 year out of the last 5 or 6 that you've been in that sort of range or below that.  Every other year it's been better than that. I'm just wondering you mentioned the Q1 activity that you've seen across the board, why are we not seeing a bit more of a half-over-half uptick than in sort of the momentum in the back half? Jayshree Ullal : It's like anything else. Our numbers are getting larger and larger. So activity has to translate to larger numbers. So of course, if we see it improve even more, we'll guide appropriately for the quarter.  But at the moment, we're feeling very good just increasing our guide from 10% to 12% to 12% to 14%. As you know, Arista doesn't traditionally do that so early in the year. So please read that as confidence but cautiously confident or optimistically confident, but nevertheless confident. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. We will move on to the next question from George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I want to key in on something I think you guys said earlier in the monologue. You mentioned that Ethernet was 10% better than InfiniBand. And I -- my notes are incomplete here. Could you just remind me exactly what you were talking about there? What is the comparison you're making to InfiniBand? And just anything, I'd love to learn more about that. Jayshree Ullal : Certainly, George. Historically, as you know, when you look at InfiniBand and Ethernet in isolation, there are a lot of advantages of each technology. Traditionally, InfiniBand has been considered lossless and Ethernet is considered to have some loss properties.  However, when you actually put a full GPU cluster together along with the optics and everything, and you look at the coherents of the job completion time across all packet sizes, data has shown that and this is data that we have gotten from third parties, including Broadcom, that just about in every packet size in a real-world environment independent of the comparing those technologies, the job completion time of Ethernet was approximately 10% faster.  So you can look at these things in silos. You can look at it in a practical cluster and in a practical cluster we are already seeing improvements on Ethernet. Now don't forget, this is just Ethernet as we know it today. Once we have the ultra Ethernet consortium and some of the improvements you're going to see on packet spring and dynamic load balancing and congestion control, I believe those numbers will get even better. George Notter : Got it. I assume you're talking about RoCE here as opposed to just straight up Ethernet, is that correct? Jayshree Ullal : In all cases, right now, pre UEC, we're talking about RDMA or Ethernet, exactly. RoCE version too, which is the most deployed NIC you have in most scenarios. But with [indiscernible] RoCE, we're seeing 10% improvement, Imagine when we go to UEC. George Notter : I know you guys are also working on your own version of Ethernet, presumably, it blends into the UEC standard over time. But what do you think the differential might be there relative to InfiniBand? Do you have a sense on what that might look like? Jayshree Ullal : We have metrics yet, but it's not like we're working on our own version of Ethernet, we are working on the UEC compatible and compliant version of Ethernet. And there's 2 aspects of it. What we do on the switch and what others do on the NIC, right? So what we do on the switch, I think, will be -- we've already built an architecture we call it, the Etherlink architecture that takes into consideration the buffering, the congestion control, the load balancing and largely, we'll have to make some software improvements.  The NICs, especially at 400 and 800 is where we are looking to see more improvements because that will give us additional performance from the server onto the switch. So we need both half to work together. Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Benjamin Reitzes : I was wondering if you can characterize how you're seeing NVIDIA in the market right now. And are you seeing yourselves go more head to head? How do you see that evolving? And if you don't mind also, I think NVIDIA moves to a more systems-based approach potentially with Blackwell. How you see that impacting your competitiveness with NVIDIA? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Thanks, Ben, for a loaded question. First of all, I want to bank NVIDIA and Jensen. I think it's important to understand that we wouldn't have a massive AI networking opportunity if NVIDIA didn't build some fantastic GPUs. So yes, we see them in the market all the time, mostly using our networks to their GPUs and NVIDIA is the market leader there, and I think they've created an incremental market opportunity for us that we are very, very reduced by.  Now do we see them in the market? Of course, we do. I see them on GPUs. We also see them on the RoCE or RDMA ethernet NIC side. And then sometimes we see them, obviously, when they're pushing InfiniBand, which has been, for most part, the de facto network of choice. You might have heard me say, last year or the year before, I was outside looking into this AI networking.  But today, we feel very pleased that we are able to be the scale-out network for NVIDIA's, GPUs and NICs based on Ethernet. We don't see NVIDIA as a direct competitor yet on the Ethernet side. I think it's 1% of their business. It's 100% of our business. So we don't worry about that overlap at all. And we think we've got 20 years of founding to now experience to make our Ethernet switching better and better at both on the front end and back end. So we're very confident that Arista can build the scale up network and work with NVIDIA scale-up GPUs. Thank you, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : I guess, Jayshree, given some of the executive transitions you've seen at Arista, can you just perhaps talk about [indiscernible] you can, the discussion you've had with the Board around your desire, your commitment to remain the CEO, does anything [indiscernible] that would be really helpful.  And then if I just go back to the job completion data that you talked about, given what you just said and the expected improvement, what are the reasons a customer would still use InfiniBand versus Switch more aggressively with Ethernet? Jayshree Ullal : Well, first of all, you heard Anshul, I'm sorry to see Anshul decide to do other things. I hope he comes back. We've had a lot of executives make a U-turn over time, and we call them boomerangs. So I certainly hope that's true with Anshul. But we have a very strong bench. And we've had -- we've been blessed to have a very constant bench for the last 15 years, which is very rare in our industry and in the Silicon Valley.  So while we're sorry to see Anshul make a personal decision to take a break, we know he'll remain a well-wisher. And we know the bench strength, below Anshul will now step up to do greater things. As for my commitment, to the Board, I have committed for multiple years. I think it's the wrong order. I wish Anshul had stayed and I had retired, but I'm committed to staying here for a long time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Antoine Chkaiban : So as you can see NVIDIA introduced in-network computing capabilities with NVSwitch, performing some calculations inside the switch itself. Perhaps now is not the best time to announce new products, but I'm curious about whether this is something the broader merchant silicon and Ethernet ecosystem could introduce at some point? Jayshree Ullal : Antoine, are you asking what is our new products for AI? Is that the question? Antoine Chkaiban : No, I'm asking specifically about in-network computing capabilities, NVSwitch can do some matrix multiply and add inside the switch itself. And I was wondering if this is something that the broader merchant silicon ethernet ecosystem could introduce as well? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. So just for everyone else's benefit, a lot of the in-network compute is generally done as closest to the compute layer as possible, where you're processing the GPU. So that's a very natural place. I don't see any reason why we could not do those functions in the network and offload the network for some of those compute functions. It would require a little more state and built in processing power, et cetera, but it's certainly very doable. I think it's going to be 601 and half a dozen of the other. Some would prefer it closest to the compute layer and some would like it network-wide for network scale at the network layer. So the feasibility is very much there in both cases, Antoine. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Anshul, we'll miss having you around. I echo my sentiments there, but I hope to see you soon. Jayshree, how are you guys thinking about timing of the 800 gig optics availability versus kind of use in systems? And you keep alluding to kind of next-gen product announcements for multiple quarters, not just this one, but -- should we expect this to be more around adjacent use cases, the core, including AI or Software, kind of take us in the product road map direction, if you can? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. James, you might remember like deja vu, we've had similar discussions on 400 gig too. And as you well know, to build a good switching system, you need an ecosystem around it, whether it's the NICs, the optics, the cables, the accessories. So I do believe you'll start seeing some early introduction of optical and switching products for 800 gig, but to actually build the entire ecosystem and take advantage, especially in the NICs, I think will take more than a year. So I think probably more into '25 or even '26.  That being said, I think you're going to see a lot of systems I had this discussion earlier. You're going to see 601 and half a dozen of the other, you're going to see a lot of systems where you can demonstrate high rating scale with 400 gig and go East West much wider and build large clusters that are in the tens of thousands. And then once you need -- once you have GPUs that source 800 gig, which even some of the recent GPUs don't, then you'll need not just higher ratings, but higher performance. So I don't see the ecosystem of 800 gig limiting the deployment of the AI networks. That's an important thing to remember. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. W. Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Do you expect Arista to see a knock-on effect from AI networking in the front end or at the edge as customers eventually deploy more AI workloads based -- I'm sorry, biased towards inferencing. And then maybe help us understand how we might be able to size this, if that's the case? Jayshree Ullal : Simon, just [indiscernible] in your question. We haven't [indiscernible] consideration, that's Phase 2 production. But you're absolutely right to say as you have more back end than the back end has to connect to something, which typically rather than reinventing IP and adaptive routing, you would connect to the front end of your compute and storage and WAN networks.  So while we do not take that into consideration and our $750 million projection in 2025, we naturally see the deployment of more back-end clusters resulting in a more uniform compute, storage, memory, overall front-end, back-end holistic network for AI coming in the next phase. So I think it makes a lot of sense. We -- but we first want to get the clusters deployed and then we'll do the -- a lot of our customers are fully expecting that holistic connection. And that's one -- by the way, one of the reasons they look so favorably at us. They don't want to build these disparate silos and islands of AI clusters. They really want to bring it in terms of a full uniform AI data center. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Maybe I'll flip James' question and just kind of ask what do you see as kind of some of the bottlenecks from going to -- from pilots to ultimate deployments? It sounds like it's not necessarily 800 gig. And so is it just a matter of time? Are there other pieces of the ecosystem that are -- that need to fall into place before some of those deployments can take place? Jayshree Ullal : I wouldn't call them, Meta, bottlenecks. I would definitely say it's a time-based and familiarity-based situation. The Cloud everybody knows how to deploy that, it's sort of plug and play in some ways. And -- but even in the Cloud, if you may recall, there were many use cases that emerged. . The first use case that's emerging for AI networking is, let's just build the fastest training workloads and clusters. And they're looking at performance. Power is a huge consideration, the cooling of the GPUs is a huge part of it. You would be surprised to hear a lot of times, it's just waiting on the facilities and waiting for the infrastructure to be set up, right? Then on the OS and operating side, and Ken has been quiet here. I'd love for him to chime in. But there's a tremendous amount of foundational discovery that goes into what do they need to do in the cluster. Do they need to do some hashing? Do they need to do load balancing? Do they need to do this set Layer 2, Layer 3? Do they need visibility features? Do they need to connect it across the WAN or interconnect? So -- and of course, as you rightly pointed out, there's the whole 400 to 800. We're -- but we're seeing less of that because a lot of it is familiarity and understanding how to operate the cluster with the best job completion time and visibility, manageability and availability of the GPUs, Nobody can tolerate downtime. Ken, I'd love to hear your point of view on this. Kenneth Duda : Yes. Thanks, Jayshree. Look, I think that what's lacking people's deployment is the availability of all the pieces. And so there's a huge pent-up demand for this stuff and we see these clusters getting built, as fast as people can build the facilities, get the GPUs and get the networking they need. I think that we're extraordinarily well positioned here because we've got years of experience building scaled storage clusters in some of the world's largest cloud players and storage clusters are not identical to AI clusters but they have some of the same issues with managing a massive scale back-end network that needs to be properly low-balanced, needs a lot of buffer to manage bursts.  And so -- and then some of the congestion management stuff we've done there is also useful in AI networks. And in particular, this InfiniBand topic keeps coming up. And I'd just like to point out that Ethernet is about 50 years old. And over those 50 years, Ethernet has come head-to-head with a bunch of technologies like Token ring, SONET, ATM, FDDI, HIPPI, Scalable Coherent Interconnect, [ Mirrornet ]. And all of these battles have one thing in common. Ethernet won. And the reason why is because of Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is quadratic in the number of nodes of the interconnect. And so anybody who tries to build something which is not Ethernet, is starting off with a very large quadratic disadvantage. And any temporary advantage they have because of the -- some detail of the tech cycle is going to be quickly overwhelmed by the connectivity advantage you have with Ethernet. So I think exactly how many years it takes for InfiniBand to go to [ waver ] fiber channel, I'm not sure, but that's where it's all headed. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company. Benjamin Bollin : Jayshree, you made a comment that back when we had guidance in November, you had about 3 to 6 months of visibility. Could you take us through what type of visibility you have today? And maybe compare and competes the different subsets of customers and how they differ? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Ben. That's a good question. So let me take it by category, like you said. In the Cloud and AI Titans in November, we were really searching for even 3 months visibility, 6 would have been amazing. Today, I think after a year of tough situations for us where the Cloud Titans were pivoting rather rapidly to AI and not thinking about the Cloud as much.  We're now seeing a more balanced approach where they're still doing AI, which is exciting, but they're also expanding their regions on the Cloud. So I would say our visibility has now improved to at least 6 months and maybe it gets longer as time goes by. On the Enterprise, I don't know. I'm not a bellwether for macro, but everybody else is citing macro, but I'm not seeing macro. What we're seeing with Chris Schmidt and Ashwin and the entire team is a profound amount of activity in Q1, better than we normally see in Q1. Q1 is usually they come back from the holidays. January slow. There's some East Coast storms to deal with, winter is still strong. But we have had one of the strongest activities in Q1, which leads us to believe that it can only get better for the rest of the year, and hence, the guide increase from an otherwise conservative team of Chantelle and myself, right? And then the Tier 2 cloud providers, I want to speak to them for a moment because not only are they strong for us right now, but they are starting to pick up some AI initiatives as well. So they're not as large as close as the Cloud Titans, but the combination of the Service Providers and the Tier 2 Specialty Providers is also seeing some momentum. So overall, I would say our visibility has now improved from 3 months to over 6 months. And in the case of the Enterprise, obviously, our sales cycles can be even longer. So it takes time to convert into wins. But the activity has never been higher. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : It was very encouraging to hear about the migration of trials to pilots with ANET's production roll out to support GPUs in the range of, I think you said 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs for 2025. And First, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the key determinants about where we -- how we end up in that range, high end versus low end? And then second, assuming $250,000 per GPU, that would imply about $25 billion of compute spending. ANET's target of $750 million would only be about 3% of the high end. And I think you've talked about 10% to 15% networking as a percentage of compute historically. So I was just wondering if you could talk about what I may be missing there, if there's anything to call out in those assumptions. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Thank you, Michael. I think we could do better next year. But your point is well taken that in order to go from 10,000 of GPUs to 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, a lot of things have to come together. First of all, let's talk about the data center or AI center facility itself.  There's a tremendous amount of work and lead time that goes into the power, the cooling, the facilities. And so now when you're talking this kind of production as opposed to proving something in the lab, that's a key factor. The second one is the GPU, the number of GPUs, the location of the GPUs, the scale of the GPUs, the locality of these GPUs, should they go with Blackwell should they build with a scale up inside the server or scale out to the network. So the whole center of gravity, what's nice to watch which is why we're more constructive on the 2025 numbers is that the GPU lead times have significantly improved, which means more and more of our customers will get more GPUs, which in turn means they can build out to scale our network. But again, a lot of work is going into that.  And the third thing I would say is the scale, the performance, how much ratings they want to put in. And then I'll give a quick analogy here. We ran into something similar on the Cloud when we were talking about 4-way CMP or 8-way CMP or these railways designs that is often called and the number of NICs you connect to go 8-way or 4-way or 12-way or switch off and go to 800 gig the performance and scale will be the third metric. So I think power GPU locality and performance of the network are the 3 major considerations that allow us to get more positive on the rate of production in 2025. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : I got to ask one more on AI. Sorry to beat a dead horse. But as we think about the stronger start to the year and the migration from trials to pilot specific in relation to AI, is there a ramp towards getting to that $750 million next year? And I guess more importantly, is there any material contribution baked into this year's outlook? Or is there any contribution that may be driving the 2 percentage point increase relative to the prior guide for '24. Jayshree Ullal : Chantelle, you want to take that? I've been talking of AI a lot. I think you should. Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes, I can take this AI question. So I think that when you think about the $750 million target that has become more constructive to Jayshree's prepared remarks, that's a glide path. So it's not 0 in '24, It's a glide path to '25. So I would say there is some assumed in the sense of it's a glide path, but it will end in 2025 at the $750 million in the glide path, not a hockey stick. Yes. Jayshree Ullal : It's not 0 this year Matt. for sure. Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sebastien Naji with William Blair. Sebastien Cyrus Naji : I've got a non-AI question here. So maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the incremental investments that you're making within your go-to-market this year, particularly as you look to grab some share from competitors. A lot of them are going through some type of disruption, one or the other acquisitions, et cetera. And then what you might be doing with the channel partners to land more of those mid-market customers as well? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Sebastian, we're probably doing a little more on investment than we have done enough progress on channel partners, to be honest. But last couple of years, we were getting very apologize about our lead times. Our lead times have improved. So we have stepped up our investment on go-to-market, where I'm expecting Chris Schmidt and Ashwin's team to grow significantly and judging from the activities they've had and the investments they've been making in '23 and '24, we're definitely going to continue to pedal to the metal on that. I think our investments in AI and Cloud Titans remain about the same because while there is a significant technical focus on the systems engineering and product side, we don't see a significant change on the go-to-market side. And on the channel partners, I would say, where this really comes to play and this will play out over multiple years, it's not going to happen this year is on the campus.  Today, our approach on the campus is really going after our larger Enterprise customers. We got 9,000 customers, probably 2,500 that we're really going to target. And so our mid-market is more targeted at specific verticals like health care, education, public sector. and then we appropriately work with the channel partners in the region, in the country, to deal with that.  To get to the first billion, I think this will be a fine strategy. As we aim beyond $750 million to $1 billion, and we need to go to the second billion, absolutely, we need to do more work on channels. This is still work in progress. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I'm going to shift gears away from AI actually. Jayshree, if we look at the server market over the past handful of quarters, we've seen unit numbers down quite considerably. I'm curious, as you look at some of your larger Cloud customers, how you would characterize the traditional server side and whether or not you're seeing signs of them moving past this kind of optimization phase and whether or not you think a server refresh cycle in front of you could be a incremental catalyst to the company? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I think if you remember, there was this one dreadful year where we -- one of our customers skipped a service cycle. But generally speaking, on the front-end network now, we're going back to the cloud. And we do see service refresh and service cycles continue to be in the 3 to 5 years.  For performance upgrades, they like 3, but occasionally, some of them may go a little higher. So absolutely, we believe there will be another cloud cycle because of the server refresh. And the associated use cases because once you do that on the server, there's appropriately the regional spine and then the data center interconnect and the storage and some much ripple effect from that server use case upgrade.  That side of compute and CPU is not changing. It's continuing to happen. In addition to which we're also seeing more and more regional expansion. New regions are being created and designed and outfitted for the cloud by our major Titans. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Karl Ackerman : Jayshree, you spoke about how you are not seeing any slowness in Enterprise. I'm curious whether that is being driven by the growing mix of your software revenue? And do you think the deployment of AI Networks on-prem can be a more meaningful driver for your Enterprise and financial customers in the second half of fiscal '24? Or will that be more of a fiscal '25 event? Jayshree Ullal : Well, that's a very good question. I have to analyze this some more. I would say our Enterprise activity is really driven by the fact that Ken has produced some amazing software quality and innovation. And we have a very high quality, universal topology, where you don't have to buy 5 different OSs and 50 different images and operate this network with thousands of people. It's a very elegant architecture that applies to the data center use case that you just outlined, for Leaf/Spine. The same Universal Spine can apply to the campus. It applies to the wide area. It applies to the branch. It applies to security. It applies to observability. And you bring up a good point that while the enterprise use cases for AI are small, we are seeing some activity there as well. Relative to the large AI Titans, they're still very small.  But think of them as back in the trial phase I was describing earlier, trials, pilot production, -- so a lot of our enterprise customers are starting to go in the trial phase of GPU clusters. So that's a nice use case as well. But the biggest ones are still in the data center campus and the general purpose Enterprise. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : So Jayshree, I have a question about -- I want to go back to AI, the road map and the deployment schedule for Blackwell. So it sounds like it's a bit slower than maybe initially expected with initial customer delivery late this year. How are you thinking about that in terms of your road map specifically and how that plays into what you're thinking about '25 in a little bit more detail. And does that late delivery maybe put a little bit of a pause on maybe some of the cloud spend in the fall of this year as there seems to be somewhat of a technology transition going on towards Blackwell away from the Legacy product? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. We're not seeing a pause yet. I don't think anybody is going to wait for Blackwell necessarily in 2024 because they're still bringing up their GPU clusters. And how a cluster is divided across multiple tenants, the choice of host, memory, storage architectures, optimizations on the GPU for collective communication, libraries, specific workloads, resilience, visibility, all of that has to be taken into consideration.  All this to say, a good scale-out network has to be built, no matter whether you're connecting to today's GPUs or future Balckwells. And so they're not going to pause the network because they're waiting for Blackwell. they're going to get ready for the network, whether it connects to a Blackwell or a current H100.  So as we see it, the training workloads and the urgency of getting the best job completion time is so important that they're not going to spare any investments on the network side and the network side can be ready no matter what the GPU is. Liz Stine : Thanks, David. This concludes the Arista Networks First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; and Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal second quarter ending June 30, 2024. If you would like a copy of this release, you can access it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2024 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization and the benefits of acquisitions which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on the call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. As a pure-play networking innovator with greater than $70 billion TAM ahead of us, we are pleased with our superior execution this quarter. We delivered revenues of $1.69 billion for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.10. Services and Software Support renewals contributed strongly at approximately 17.6% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 65.4% was influenced by outstanding manufacturing discipline realizing cost reductions. International contribution for the quarter registered at 19%, with the Americas strong at 81%. As we celebrated our tenth anniversary at the New York Stock Exchange with our near and dear investors and customers, we are now supporting over 10,000 customers with a cumulative of 100 million ports deployed worldwide. In June 2024, we launched Arista's Etherlink AI platforms that are ultra-Ethernet consortium compatible, validating the migration from InfiniBand to Ethernet. This is a rich portfolio of 800-gig products, not just a point product but in fact, a complete portfolio that is both NIC and GPU agnostic. The AI portfolio consists of the 7060 x6 AI [ph] switch that supports 64800 gig or 128 400-gig Ethernet ports with a capacity of 51 terabits per second. The 7800 R4 AI Spine is our fourth generation of Arista's flagship 7800, offering 100% nonblocking throughput with a proven virtual output queuing architecture. The 7800 R4 supports up to 460 terabits in a single chassis, corresponding to 576800 gigabit Ethernet ports or 1,152 400 gigabit port density. The 7700 R4 AI distributed Etherlink Switch is a unique product offering with a massively parallel distributed scheduling and congestion-free traffic spraying fabric. The 7700 represents the first in a new series of ultra-scalable intelligent distributed systems that can deliver the highest consistent throughput for very large AI clusters. Let's just say once again, Arista is making Ethernet great. First, we began this journey with low latency in 2009 time frame. And then there was cloud and routing in the 2015 era, followed by WAN and Campus in the 2020 era and now AI in our fifth generation in 2025 era. Our Etherlink portfolio is in the midst of trials and can support up to 100,000 XTUs in a 2-tier design built on our proven and differentiated extensible OS. We are quite pleased with our progress across Cloud, AI, Campus and Enterprise customers. I would like to invite Ashwin Kohli, our newly appointed Chief Customer Officer, to describe our diverse set of customer wins in 2024. Ashwin, over to you. Ashwin Kohli : Many thanks, Jayshree. Thank you for inviting me to my first earnings call. Let me walk everybody through the 4 global customer wins. The first example is an AI enterprise win with a large Tier 2 cloud provider which has been heavily investing in GPUs to increase their revenue and penetrate new markets. Their senior leadership wanted to be less reliant on traditional core services and work with Arista on new, reliable and scalable Ethernet fabrics. Their environment consisted of new NVIDIA H100s [ph]. However, it was being connected to their legacy networking vendor which resulted in them having significant performance and scale issues with their AI applications. The goal of our customer engagement was to refresh the front-end network to alleviate these issues. Our technical partnership resulted in deploying a 2-step migration path to alleviate the current issues using 400-gig 7080s, eventually migrating them to an 800-gig AI Ethernet link in the future. The second next win highlights our adjacencies in both campus and routing. This customer is a large data center customer which has deployed us for almost a decade. The team was able to leverage that success to help them demonstrate our value for the global campus network which spans across hundreds and thousands of square feet globally. The customer had considerable dissatisfaction with a current vendor which led them to a last-minute request to create a design for their new corporate headquarters. Given only 3 months' window, Arista leveraged the existing data center design and adapted this to the campus topology with a digital twin of the design in minimal time. CloudVision was used for visibility and life cycle management. The same customer once again was struggling with extreme complexity in their routing environment, as well with multiple parallel backbones and numerous technical complexities. Arista simplified their routing network by removing legacy routers, increasing bandwidth and moving to a simple fixed form factor platform router. The core spine leverages the same U.S. software, streamlining their certification procedures and instilling confidence in the stability of the products. Once again, CloudVision came to the rescue. The third example is the next win in the international arena of a large automotive manufacturer that due to its size and scale, previously had more than 3 different vendors in the data center which created a very high level of complexity both from a technical and also from an operational perspective. The customer's key priority was to achieve a higher level of consistency across their infrastructure which is now being delivered via a single U.S. binary image and CloudVision solution from Arista. Their next top priority was to use automation, consistent end-to-end provisioning and visibility which can be delivered by our CloudVision platform. This simplification has led the customer to adopt Arista beyond the data center and extend the Arista solution into the routing component of the infrastructure which included our 7500 R3 spine platforms. This once again shows a very clear example of the same Arista 1 EOS and One CloudVision solution delivering multiple use cases. And Jayshree, this last win demonstrates our strength in service provider routing space. We have been at the forefront of providing innovative solutions for service provider customers for many years. As we all know, we are in the midst of an optical and packet integration. As a result, our routers support industry-leading dense 400-gig Zero Plus [ph] coherent pluggable optics. In this service provider customer example, we provided a full turnkey solution, including our popular 7280 R3 routers and our newly announced AWE 7250 WAN router as a BGP route reflector along with CloudVision and professional services. We showcased our strength in supporting a wide variety of these pluggable coherent optics, along with our SR and EVP and solutions which allowed this middle mine service provider customer to build out a 400-gig state-wide backbone at cloud scale economics. Thanks, Jayshree and back over to you. Jayshree Ullal : Well, thank you, Ashwin and congratulations. Hot off the press is our new and highest Net Promoter Score of 87 which translates to 95%. Hats off to your team for achieving that. It's so exciting to see the momentum of our enterprise sector. As a matter of fact, as we speak, we are powering the broadcasters of the Olympics, symbolic of our commitment to the media and entertainment vertical. And so it's fair to say that so far in 2024, it's proving to be better than we expected because of our position in the marketplace and because of our best-of-breed platform for mission-critical networking. I am reminded of the 1980s when San [ph] was famous for declaring the network is the computer. Well, 40 years later, we're seeing the same cycle come true again with the collective nature of AI training models mandating a lossless highly available network to seamlessly connect every AI accelerator in the cluster to 1 another for peak job completion times. Our AI networks also connect trained models to end users and other multi-tenant systems in the front-end data center, such as storage, enabling the AI system to become more than the sum of its parts. We believe data centers are evolving to holistic AI centers, where the network is the epicenter of AI management for acceleration of applications, compute, storage and the wide area network. AI centers need a foundational data architecture to deal with the multimodal AI data sets that run on our differentiated EOS network data systems. Arista showcased the technology demonstration of our EOS-based AI agent that can directly connect on the NIC itself or alternatively, inside the host. By connecting into adjacent Arista switches to continuously keep up with the current state, send telemetry or receive configuration updates, we have demonstrated the network working holistically with network interface cards such as NVIDIA BlueField [ph] and we expect to add more NICs in the future. Well, I think the Arista purpose and vision is clearly driving our customer traction. Our networking platforms are becoming the epicenter of all digital transactions, be they campus center, data center, plan centers or AI centers. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chantelle, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial specifics and tell us more. Over to you, Chantelle. Chantelle Breithaupt : Thanks, Jayshree. It really was great to see everyone at the New York Stock Exchange IPO celebration event. Now turning to the numbers. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q2 were $1.69 billion, up 15.9% year-over-year, significantly above the upper end of our guidance of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion. Growth was delivered across all 3 sectors of Cloud, Enterprise and Providers. Services and Subscription Software contributed approximately 17.6% of revenue in the quarter, up from 16.9% in Q1. International revenues for the quarter came in at $316 million or 18.7% of total revenue, down from 20.1% in the prior quarter. This quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by a relatively weaker performance in our APJ region. The overall gross margin in Q2 was 65.4%, above our guidance of 64%, up from 64.2% last quarter and up from 61.3% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in inventory-related reserves. Operating expenses for the quarter were $319.8 million or 18.9% of revenue, up from last quarter at $265 million. R&D spending came in at $216.7 million or 12.8% of revenue, up from $164.6 million in the last quarter. This primarily reflected increased headcount and higher new product introduction costs in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $85.1 million or 5% of revenue compared to $83.7 million last quarter, with a double-digit percentage increase of headcount in the quarter versus the prior year. Our G&A costs came in at $18 million or 1.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at $16.7 million. Our operating income for the quarter was $785.6 million or 46.5% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $70.9 million and our effective tax rate was 21.5%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $672.6 million or 39.8% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 319.9 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.10, up 32.9% from the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at $6.3 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased $172 million of our common stock at an average price of $282.20 per share. Of the $172 million, $82 million was repurchased under our prior $1 billion authorization which is now complete and the remaining $90 million was purchased under the new program of $1.2 billion approved in May 2024. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be depended upon market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Now turning to operating cash performance for the second quarter. We generated $989 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance with a favorable contribution from working capital. DSO came in at 66 days, up from 62 days in Q1, impacted by large service renewals at the end of the quarter. Inventory turns were 1.1x, up from 1 turn last quarter. Inventory decreased to $1.9 billion in the quarter, down from $2 billion in the prior period, reflecting a reduction in our raw materials inventory. Our purchase commitments and inventory at end of the quarter totaled $4 billion, up from $3.5 billion at the end of Q1. We expect this number to stabilize as supplier lead times improve but we'll continue to have some variability in future quarters as a reflection of demand for our new product introductions. Our total deferred revenue balance was $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenue increased approximately $253 million versus last quarter. As a reminder, we expect 2024 to be a year of new product introductions, new customers and expanded use cases. These trends may result in increased customer trials and contracts with customer-specific acceptance clauses and increase the variability and magnitude of our product deferred revenue balances. Accounts payable days was 46 days, up from 36 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million. As we enter the second half of fiscal year 2024, we are encouraged by the momentum that we see in the market. Our existing innovative product portfolio, along with our new product introductions, are well suited for our Cloud, AI Enterprise and Providers customers. We will continue to invest in our R&D and go-to-market through both people and processes. With all of this as a backdrop for fiscal year '24, our revenue growth guidance is now at least 14%. Gross margin outlook remains at 62% to 64% and operating margin is now raised to approximately 44%. Our guidance for the third quarter based on non-GAAP results and excluding any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows : revenues of approximately $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion, gross margin of approximately 63% to 64% and operating margin at approximately 44%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, with diluted shares of approximately 321 million shares. With that, I now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Chantelle. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : As we head into next-generation GPUs with Blackwell and the MVL3672 [ph], there's been some discussion about whether the systems may be less modular in some of its components, particularly for back-end networking. I was just wondering if you could share your views and provide some clarity on the vendor modularity of Blackwell, particularly as it relates to networking? And how that might affect Arista's positioning over the next couple of years, if at all? Jayshree Ullal : Sure. Michael, I think as the GPUs get faster and faster, obviously, the dependency on the network for higher throughput is clearly related. And therefore, our timely introduction of these 800-gig products will be required, especially more for Blackwell. In terms of its connection and modularity with NVLink and 72 port [ph], there's always been a market for what I call scale up, where you're connecting the GPUs internally in a server and the density of those GPUs connecting in the past has been more PCIe and cell and now NVLink and there's a new consortium now for called UAL that's going to specify that, I believe, eventually, by the way, even there, Ethernet will win. And so that density depends more on the AI accelerator and how they choose to connect. As I've often said, it's more a bus technology. So eventually, where Arista plays strongly both on the front end and back end is on the scale out, not on the scale up. So independent of the modularity, whether it's a wrap-based design, a chassis or multiple RU, the ports have to come out Ethernet and those Ethernet ports will connect into scale-out switches from Arista. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I guess the metric that stands out to me the most is the deferred revenue balance up. Looks like 95% in total year-on-year. And it looks like you -- based on what you disclosed, it looks like you're now at about $520 million of product deferred. On the product deferred line, can you help us appreciate how do we think about that number? Is that related to these AI opportunities? Just the cadence of how we should expect the revenue recognition from that again being -- it looks like almost 60% above what was previously the peak level of product deferred. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, good question, Aaron. Let me start generically and of course, I'll hand to my CFO, Chantelle. Product deferred sort of ebbs and flows. It goes in, it comes out. And it's particularly high when we have a lot of new product and new use cases. But it's not extraordinary to see us running a higher product deferred in 1 quarter or in 1 year and then dipping down. So the long term is consistent, the short term can ebb and flow. Do you want to say a few words on that? Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes, thank you, Jayshree. The only thing I would add to that is that the deferred balance is always a mix of customers and use cases. So I wouldn't rotate on any 1 particular intersection of those. It really is a mix of those combined. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Great. Jayshree, last quarter, you had mentioned kind of 4 major AI trials that you guys were a part of. Obviously, you guys -- or Ashwin listed off the list of kind of the 4 wins that you had during the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of maybe if that Tier 2 win was a part of those AI trials? Or just any update on where those 4 AI trials stand or what the current count of AI trials is currently? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. No, I'm going to speak to it and I want to turn it over to Ashwin since he's here with us. First of all, all 4 trials are largely in what I call Cloud and AI Titans. A couple of them could be classified as specialty providers as well, depending on how they end up. But those 4 are going very well. They started out as largely trials. They're now moving into pilots this year, most of them. And with any luck next year, maybe we won't be saying 4 to 5 and we could say 5 out of 5. That's my hope, anyway. But in addition to that, we have tens of smaller customers who are starting to do AI pilots. And Ashwin, you've been smack in the middle of a lot of those, maybe you want to speak to that a little bit? Ashwin Kohli : Yes. Absolutely, Jayshree. Meta, so I just wanted to clarify the example that I shared with you was more around a Tier 2 cloud provider. And if I take a step back, the types of conversations my team is having with customers is either around general-purpose enterprise customers or it's around Tier 2 cloud providers, right which are different to the ones Jayshree's referring to. Jayshree Ullal : And they tend to be early adopters. Ashwin Kohli : Absolutely. Jayshree Ullal : They're about to build an AI cluster. It's a reasonably small size, not classified in thousands or 10 thousands. But you've got to start somewhere. So they started about a few hundred GPUs, would you say? Ashwin Kohli : Absolutely, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Jayshree, you mentioned a $70 billion TAM number in your prepared remarks. Can you help us understand what is in that TAM? And how does that relate to the $750 million AI networking revenue number you have provided for next year? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, I get asked that question a lot. First of all, the TAM is far greater than the $750 million we've signed up for. And remember, that's early years. But that can consist of our data center TAM. Our AI TAM which we count in a more narrow fashion as how much of InfiniBand will move to Ethernet on the back end. We don't count the AI TAM that's already in the front end which is part and parcel of our data center. And then obviously, there's a campus TAM which is very, very big. It's north of $10 billion. And then there's the wide area in routing. So these 4 are the building blocks that I call the campus center, data center, AI center and ran center [ph]. And then laid upon that is some very nice software. If you saw, we had a nice bump in Software and Service renewals this quarter which would be largely centered around CloudVision observability and security. So I would say these are the 4 building blocks and then the 3 software components on top of it. Not -- of course, not to forget the services and support that are part of these TAMs as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Antoine Chkaiban : I'd like actually to ask about the non-AI component of your Cloud and AI segment. What can you tell us about how investments in traditional infrastructure are trending? Because we heard from other vendors that inventory digestion is now easing. So are you seeing that too? Jayshree Ullal : We saw that last year. We saw that there was a lot of pivot going on from the classic cloud, as I like to call it, to the AI in terms of spend. And we continue to see favorable preferences to AI spend in many of our large cloud customers. Having said that, at the same time, simultaneously, we are going through a refresh cycle where many of these customers are moving from 100 to 200 or 200 to 400 gig. So while we think AI will grow faster than cloud, we're betting on classic cloud continuing to be an important aspect of our contributions. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess just a question related to the updated '24 guide and I realize it's at least 14% growth for the year. But your compares actually get much easier in the back half of the year versus what you've had in the first half. So just from an H2 versus H1 basis, is it reasonable to think that growth can actually accelerate for you in the back half of the year? And if it doesn't, why do you think it does not accelerate in the back half? Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. I think that Jayshree and I came to this guide of at least 14% because we do see multiple scenarios as we go through the second half of the year. We do expect to continue to see some acceleration in growth but I would say that from the perspective of the forward scenarios, we are comfortable with at least 14% and we'll come back in Q3 and see where we were able to guide for the rest of the year. Jayshree Ullal : Look at us. We're known to be traditionally conservative. We went from 10 to 12, 12 to 14. And now my CFO says at least 14. So let's see how the second half goes. But I think at this point, you should think we are confident about second half and we're getting increasingly confident about 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : By the way? Jayshree Ullal : Tal, you there? Tal Liani : Yes. Can you hear me? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, yes. Tal Liani : Okay. My question is more in line with kind of the previous question. I calculated the implied growth in the fourth quarter. And I'm getting a much lower growth in the fourth quarter than what we've seen this quarter or next quarter. And I'm wondering if it's -- you said conservatism in the last answer. And the question is, is it just conservatism? Or is there anything special with the fourth quarter that the implied growth is only 9% year-over-year? And it goes across everything. It goes -- the implied growth, revenue growth is lower, the gross margin is lower. So some of it is conservatism but is there anything special with 4Q timing of recognition or seasonality or anything that drives a lower implied guidance? Jayshree Ullal : So Tal, if you go back to November Analyst Day, to call out gross margin lower, I would disagree because I think we're just blowing it off our guide. Our guide was 63 to 64. And we have now shown 2 quarters of amazing gross margin. Hats off to my Mike Capas [ph] and John McCool, Alex and the entire team for really working on disciplined cost reductions. But yet, if you look at mix, in general, the costs and et cetera, I would say you should plan on our gross margins being as we projected. They're not lower. I think we just did exceptionally well the last 2 quarters, so it's relatively lower. That's the first thing. Second, in terms of growth, I would say we always aim for double-digit growth. We came in with 10% to 12%. And again, Q2 is just an outstanding quarter. I don't want to use it as a benchmark for how Q3, Q4 will be. But of course, we're operating off large numbers. We'll aim to do better but we'll have more visibility as we go into Q3 and we'll be able to give you a good sense of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I guess I was just curious about what your expectations were coming into the quarter for product deferred revenue. I guess I'm curious how much you thought would be added to that product deferred category in Q2. And then also, do you have a view on product deferred revenue for Q3? Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. Yes, nothing's changed in our philosophy that we don't guide product deferred revenue. So that's -- there's nothing new there to report. I would say in the sense of coming to this quarter, we -- we don't guide the product deferred revenue. We have an idea in the sense of where we're going to land as we go through the quarter. But I would say that it met expectations from what we were having in our planning forecast process. George Notter : Got it. And I assume these are new products you've shipped to customers, you're waiting for customer acceptance. Any sense for when those customer acceptances might start to flow through? Is that a 2024 event? Is that a 2025 event? How do you think about it? Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. They all have different timings because they're unique to the customer, the use case, AI, classic cloud, et cetera. So they're all unique and bespoke that way. So there's no set trending on that. And so as we roll through the quarters, they'll come off as they get deployed and -- and then that's where we'll land from a forecasting perspective. Jayshree Ullal : And I think it's fair to say if it's AI, it takes longer, if it's classic cloud, it's shorter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : And strong results here. But if I can just ask a question on the commentary that Ashwin had in the prepared remarks. Ashwin, you mentioned the Tier 2 customer, where you're refreshing the front end as I sort of interpreted it to alleviate some of the bandwidth sort of concerns from the back end. How do you think about that opportunity across your customer base? Particularly, how should we think about sort of that as being attached to the $750 million target for back-end revenues that you have for next year? Just help us think about the opportunity that you're seeing with your customers on that side. Ashwin Kohli : Yes, Samik, it's hard to say, right? I mean I don't want to attach the $750 million back to this 1 customer, right? The goal around this 1 customer was to demonstrate our wins in enterprise and in the non-cloud space. But outside that, it would be very hard to go translate that to what's happening within the $750 million, right? I don't know, Jayshree, if you've got any comments around that at all? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I was just going to add that -- there are 4 things Ashwin and the team are seeing in the enterprise and provider sector. I think the migration to 100 gig data center is pretty solidly going on. If anybody is still on a 10 and 40, they're definitely not a early adopter of technology. And some of them are even moving to 400 gig, I would say. Ashwin Kohli : Absolutely, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : So that's on the data center. Campus, I know, in general, is a slow market. But for Arista, we are still seeing a lot of desire. And you heard Ashwin talk about a campus win but they're really frustrated and they're struggling with existing campus deployments. So we feel really good about our $750 million target for next year. The routed ran, again, we're both in Tier 2 and service providers and even in enterprise, there's a lot of activity going on there. And finally, the AI trials you talked about, they tend to be smaller but it's a representation of the confidence the customer has. They may be using other GPUs, servers, et cetera. But when it comes to the mission critical networks, they've recognized the importance of best-of-breed reliability, availability, performance, no loss and the familiarity with the data center is naturally leading to pilots and trials on the AI side with us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Karl Ackerman : So there are several data points across the supply chain that indicate enterprise networking and traditional server units are beginning to recover. I was hoping you might discuss what you are hearing from your enterprise and service provider customers on their commitment to upgrade their services and networking gear over the next couple of quarters. And as you address that, perhaps you could discuss the number of new customers being added in these verticals over the last couple of quarters out of the 10,000 or so that you have today? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Let me take the second question. I think we are adding systematically. We celebrated the 10,000. And so because of -- in the past, we used to add large numbers of customers. Now we're adding many small customers who are pleased with the systematic add of hundreds of customers every quarter and that's going very, very well. On the -- what was your other -- former question? Karl Ackerman : How to think about the adoption or the growth of server and networking gear on for campus environments and what you're seeing there. Jayshree Ullal : Okay. So perhaps it may come as a surprise to you but servers aren't always related to campus. Devices and users are much more related to campus, right? Service tend to be dealing with more data center upgrades. So in the campus, we're tending to see 2 things right now. Greenfield buildings that are -- they're planning for '25, '26 and they're smack in the middle of those RFPs. Or they're trying to create a little oasis in the desert and prove that our post-pandemic campus is much better with a Leaf/Spine topology, wired/wireless connecting to it at leaf and then enabling things like zero-touch automation, method segmentation, capabilities, analytics, et cetera. So the campus is really turning out to in a somewhat sluggish overall market. We are finding that our customers are very interested in modernizing their campus. And again, it has a lot to do with the familiarity with us in the data center and that's translating to more success in the campus. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Ben Bollin : Jayshree, I mean just the bigger picture as you think about back-end network architectures gradually capturing more of the traditional front-end. What do you think that looks like over the next several years? How quickly could that become a more realistic opportunity to capture more of that true fabric of overall compute resources? Jayshree Ullal : Well, I think there are a lot of market studies that point to today is still largely InfiniBand. You remember me, Ben, saying we were outside looking in just a year ago. So step 1 is we're feeling very gratified that the whole world, even InfiniBand players have acknowledged that we are making Ethernet great again. And so I expect more and more of that back end to be Ethernet. One thing I do expect, even though we're very signed up to the $750 million number -- at least $750 million, I should say, next year, is it's going to become difficult to distinguish the back end from the front end when they all move to Ethernet. For this AI center, as we call it, is going to be a conglomeration of both the front and the back. So if I were to fast forward 3, 4 years from now, I think the AI center is a supercenter of both the front end and the back end. So we'll be able to track it as long as there's GPUs and strictly training use cases. But if I were to fast forward, I think there may be many more edge use cases, many more inference use cases and many more small-scale training use cases which will make that distinction difficult to make. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex Henderson : I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the spending biases in the Cloud Titans. Clearly, there's an enormous amount of spending going into the AI front end, back end networking elements as well as the GPUs. But there is a rebounding growth rate of application that is ultimately driving the traditional business that has historically been called the CPU side of the data center. And I'm wondering if they're under-investing in there and that there's going -- whether there's a potential for a catch-up in the spending in that area at some juncture because of the over bias to or whether that investment is ongoing at a reasonable rate, consistent with a moderate acceleration in the application growth? Jayshree Ullal : Alex, it's a very thought provoking question. I would say there's such a heavy bias towards -- in the Cloud Titans towards training and super training and the bigger and better the GPUs, the billion parameters, the OpenAI, ChatGPT and LAMAs [ph] that you're absolutely right that at some level, the classic cloud, what you call traditional, I'm still calling classic, is a little bit neglected last year and this year. Having said that, I think once the training models are established, I believe this will come back and it will sort of be a vicious cycle that feeds on each other. But at the moment, we're seeing more activity on the AI and more moderate activity on the cloud. Alex Henderson : Does the reacceleration of application growth excluding the AI play into that? I mean clearly that... Jayshree Ullal : I think it does. I don't know -- I don't know how to measure it but I think the more AI back end we put in, we expect that to have a pressure on the front end of x percent. We're still trying to assess whether that's 10%, 20%, 30%. And so we do not count that in our $750 million number, to be accurate, to the only GPU native connections. But absolutely, as the 2 holistically come together to form this AI center, I believe the front end will have pressure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jackie Day [ph] for Ben. Wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment. And if you're seeing Spectrum ex from NVIDIA? And if so, how you're doing against it? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Well, first, I just want to say, when you say competitive environment, it's complicated with NVIDIA because we really consider them a friend on the GPUs as well as the mix, so not quite a competitor. But absolutely, we will compete with them on the Spectrum switch. We have not seen the Spectrum except in 1 customer where it was bundled. But otherwise, we feel pretty good about our win rate and our success. For a number of reasons, great software, portfolio products and architecture has proven performance, visibility features, management capabilities, high availability. And so I think it's fair to say that if a customer were bundling with their GPUs, then we wouldn't see it. If a customer were looking for best of breed, we absolutely see it and win it. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Just wanted to circle back on the enterprise side of things. I guess -- is there a way to think about how many replacements you're seeing relative to prior periods? And really, I'm trying to understand if we're starting to see that core enterprise data center network refresh actually pick up versus kind of the share gains that you guys have historically seen. And is there an underlying change in enterprise customer behavior, whether it's for the data center or Jayshree, I know you were talking about the campus earlier. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, James, let me talk and Ashwin, I'm sure you have more to add since you're closer to the problem. I believe we have 3 classes of enterprise customers. The early adopters. And I think in that category, Ashwin's team is seeing a lot of refresh going. They already have 100 gig and they're potentially planning their 400 gig, right? Then the fast followers. And those guys, I think, are still looking at 100-gig migrations, right? And then the real risk averse and we're still getting to know them because our -- this is an untapped opportunity for us, right? And probably a fourth category where some of them are disillusioned with the public cloud and want to repatriate some of their workloads back into the data center. So I would say there's activity in all 4. No saturation, still a lot of opportunity for us largely in the speed upgrades and also in the class of customers and what stage they are. Ashwin, do you want to add anything to that? Ashwin Kohli : Yes. Sure, Jayshree, right? And so to answer your question, from what I'm seeing from customers, they're kind of fed up with being deployed in the data center, specifically, something which is proprietary lock-in, right? Something which is -- does not give them the flexibility to do -- join multiple use cases such as data center, campus, routing and they want something that just works. They want something that is just simple. They want to make sure that when they wake up in the morning, the network is not down. And so Arista today actually has a brand. It has a value for there. And we've actually been delivering this for the last 10-plus years. So James, I would say the message is echoing successfully in our existing customers who are taking Arista not only in the single use case of data center but expanding that across data center, campus, routing, WAN. And then the team is eagerly working with a new set of Global 2000 and Fortune 500 customers to go evangelize a message to them as well. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : Nice numbers, ladies. I wanted to go back to gross margin. Jayshree, Chantelle, if you don't mind, in your prepared remarks, you talked about manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction. I guess I'm wondering why is that not something that carries forward to the next quarter as well? I understand you're trying to be conservative but I'm sure these are not changes that have a very short lifespan that they can carry forward. So why not be a bit more optimistic on what the gross margin outlook should be? Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. No, it's a great question. And so our goal is always to try to do better than our guide. But within that guide, the question is there's -- mostly what's influencing the second half consideration is the expected mix of customers. As you can appreciate, we do have different mixes depending on the demographics of who we're selling to. So I think that's a big part of our second half, why we kept the guide as it is. We will keep looking for variable cost productivity in cost management as we go through and hope to deliver more. But at this point in time, what's mostly built into it is the mix assumption in the second half. Jayshree Ullal : And if you look at -- this isn't just this quarter. John and the team have done a fantastic job for the last year. So yes, I'm going to go back to them and ask for more but I think they will say they've done so much and might be squeezing blood out of a stone. So we'll see if they respond to more cost reductions. But I absolutely agree with Chantelle. It's largely driven by mix. And I think we've taken a lot of the cost reductions out in the last year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I know that you typically hold off on the 10% customer disclosures until the end of the fiscal year. But what I'm hoping to gather is how customer concentration may be evolving from comparison to last year, do you expect with your past customers growing their spending so much that it stays similar or with the diversity of the new opportunities, the concentration you've had historically declined. Any kind of indication you could offer? I'd appreciate it. Jayshree Ullal : I mean, I'll try but you're right to say that we don't know. It's only half the year. I expect both Microsoft and Meta to be greater than 10% customers for us. I don't expect any other 10% concentration. Now in Microsoft and Meta, how they will pivot to AI and how they will reduce the spend and all that things, that movie will play out in the next 6 months. So we'll know better. But at this point, I think you can assume they won't be exactly the same. Some may go up, some may go down. But these are 2 extremely vital customers, strategic customers, we co-develop with them. We partner with them very, very well. And we expect to do well with them, both in cloud and AI, depending on their priorities, of course. Simon Leopold : And does the pipeline suggest you can have new 10% customers next year? Or do you expect sort of a similar concentration next year? Jayshree Ullal : We're not aware of any customer that will approach 10% this year or next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : Maybe we'll go over to the software services, the AI stuff has been beaten up a little bit here. In a good way. You talked a lot about some of the software capabilities. It seems like Arista might be leaning in a little bit more to this revenue line. It's been growing faster than the hardware product the last multiple quarters. So could you talk about kind of sustainability of that strength focus that you guys have on this service software area and what that would mean to growth rate going forward? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the change in question. I appreciate that. I think we will be in the teens for some time because there are 3 building blocks and a lot of this, Ashwin, you know very well. There's the services building block that as product goes up, there's a lot of pressure on us on a percentage of service to be lower, right? So that, while it may -- historically has been in the teens, can be lower. Then the second one is our perpetual software which, again, is a strong function of use cases, particularly things like routing, et cetera, where we've done very, very well. The stronger we do there, the better we do there. An extension of that is CloudVision which can be -- is more a subscription service with CloudVision as a service, either Network-as-a-Service or on the premise. So that's the second building block for us that's going strong. The one I want to point to a little more which could help us is the security [indiscernible]. You may know in May, we introduced the micro and macro segmentation. We also announced UNO, our Unified Network Observability. And while this is new, Ashwin and I have great plans for that and I think this could be a swing factor. As the services components may reduce over time, these new product components may increase. So 17 points, whatever percentage was is a great number. And if we can consistently stay there, I'd be very proud, particularly as our numbers get larger. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sebastien Naji with William Blair. Sebastien Naji : Sorry to bring you guys back to the AI conversation but this 1 is a little bit more high level. I guess, we keep hearing about bigger and bigger API clusters that are being built. And as Arista is working on connecting these larger and larger clusters as they scale, I'm just wondering, does that impact your ability to capture more revenue? Is -- you've talked about 15% of CapEx. Does that maybe change or go up or go down as these clusters that you're having to connect get bigger and bigger? Jayshree Ullal : Yes, so if you look at an AI network design, you can look at it through 2 lenses, just through the compute, in which case you look at scale up and you look at it strictly through how many processes there are. But when we look at an AI network design, it's a number of GPUs or XTUs per workload. Distribution and location of these GPUs are important. And whether the cluster has multiple tenants and how it's divvied up between the host, the memory, the storage and the wide area plays a role and the optimization to make on the applications for the collective communication libraries for specific workloads, levels of resilience, how much redundancy you want to put in, active, link base, load balancing, types of visibility. So the metrics are just getting more and more. There are many more commutations in combination. But it all starts with number of GPUs, performance and billions of parameters. Because the training models are definitely centered around job completion time. But then there's multiple concentric circles of additional things we have to add to that network design. All this to say, a network design-centric approach has to be taken for these GPU clusters. Otherwise, you end up being very siloed and that's really what we're working on. So it goes beyond scale and performance to some of these other metrics I mentioned. Liz Stine : Thanks, Sebastien. Operator, we have time for one last question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Maybe just to bring it back together and maybe both for Jayshree and Chantelle. I guess what I'm trying to think through is this is your product introduction. You have a pretty strong ramp of AI likely next year. But does the guide imply that we're going to start to see a much bigger contribution in Q4 driven by the comments around mix earlier and the gross margin discussion? Because I would imagine early in the stage of their life cycle plus the fact that they're hyperscalers, they're going to be a relatively more modest gross margin profile at the beginning of the glide path versus the end of the glide path. So just any color there in terms of what Q4 might look like from an AI perspective relative to your expectations from a glide path perspective? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Let me just remind you of how we are approaching 2024, including Q4, right? Last year, trials. So small, it was not material. This year, we're definitely going into pilots. Some of the GPUs and you've seen this in public blogs published by some of our customers have already gone from tens of thousands to 24,000 and are heading towards 50,000 GPUs. Next year, I think there will be many of them heading into tens of thousands aiming for 100,000 GPUs. So I see next year as more promising. Some of them might happen this year. But I think we're very much in -- going from trials to pilots, trials being hundreds. And this year, we're in the thousands. But I wouldn't focus on Q4. I'd focus on the entire year and say, yes, we've gone into the thousands. And I'll let Chantelle turn for this glide path, right? So we expect to be single-digit small percentages of our total revenue in AI this year. But we are really, really expecting next year to be the $750 million a year or more. Chantelle Breithaupt : Yes. Yes. I think so. I completely agree, Jayshree. The only thing I would add to it is you have to think of the kind of the matrix we're working within. So we have cloud and enterprise customers and we have very, very different scopes of readiness at those customers. So Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2 next year, they're all eligible for timing for types, et cetera. So we just want to make sure that variability that I spoke to in my prepared remarks is understood in that context. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. I think and simple things like power and cooling are affecting the ability to deploy in massive scale. So there's nothing magic about Q4. There's plenty of magic about the year in its entirety and next year. Liz Stine : This concludes the Arista Networks second quarter 2024 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our results which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations; you may begin. Liz Stine : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; and Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30, 2024. If you would like a copy of this release it online at our website. During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year. longer-term business model and financial outlooks for 2025 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital optimization and the benefits of acquisitions which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Liz and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. We delivered revenues of $1.81 billion for the quarter with a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.40. Services and software support renewals contributed strongly at approximately 17.6% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was influenced by both pressure from cloud titan customer pricing, offset by favorable enterprise margin and supply chain hygiene. International contribution for the quarter registered an approximately 18% with the Americas very strong at 82%. Clearly, Q3 2024 had a lot of bright spots in the quarter and are encouraged by the strength and momentum of the company. At the recent tenth anniversary in June and 2024 celebration and vision event, we covered a lot of ground on what we would have otherwise said in an Analyst Day. So today, I'd like to briefly expand on our Arista 2.0 plans for 2025. We believe that networks are emerging at the epicenter of mission-critical transactions and our Arista 2.0 strategy is resonating well with customers. We are, we believe, the only pure-play network innovator for the next decade. Our modern networking platforms are foundational for transformation from silos to centers of data. This can be a data center a campus center, a WAN center or an AI center. At the heart of this is our state-oriented public subscribed network data lake EOS software stack for multimodal data sets. One simply cannot learn without having access to all this data. So it is all about the data. We provide customers the state foundation for data for AI and machine learning without which AI and ML would just be buzzwords. Arista is well positioned with the right network architecture for client to campus, data center, cloud and AI networking. Three principles guide us and differentiate us in bringing this data-driven networking. Number one, best-in-class, highly available proactive products with resilience and hitless upgrade built in at multiple levels; two, zero-touch automation and telemetry with predictive client to cloud one-click operations with that granular visibility that relies less on number three, prescriptive insights for deeper AI for networking delivering AIOps and algorithms for security, availability and root cause analysis. Networking for AI is gaining a lot of traction as we move from trials in 2023 to more pilots in 2024, collecting to thousands of GPUs and we expect more production in 2025 and 2026. In all vernacular, Arista AI centers are made up of both the back-end clusters and front-end networks. AR traffic differs greatly from cloud workloads in terms of diversity, duration and size of flow. The fidelity of AI traffic flows with the slowest flow matters and one slow flow could slow down the entire job completion time is a crucial factor in networking. Our AI centers connect seamlessly from the back end to the front end of compute, storage, WAN and cluster cloud networks. Arista is emerging as a pioneer in scale-out Ethernet accelerated networking for large-scale training and AI workloads. Our new Ethernet [ph] portfolio with wirespeed 800-gig throughput and non-blocking performance, scales from single tier to session 2 tier networks for over 100,000 GPUs, potentially even 1 million AI accelerators with multiple tiers. Our accelerated AI networking portfolio consists of 3 families with over 20 switching products and not just 1 point switch. At the recent OCP in mid-October 2024, we officially launched a very unique platform that distributed Ethalink7700 to build 2 tier networks for up to 10,000 GPU clusters. The 77 R4 [ph] platform was developed in close collaboration with Meta. And why it may physically look like and be cable like a 2-tier leased [ph] network, desk provides a single-stage forwarding with highly efficient spine fabric, eliminating the need for tuning and encouraging fast failover for large AI accelerator-based clusters. It complements our Arista flagship 7800 AI spine for the ultimate scale with differentiated fare and fully scheduled cell spraying architecture with a virtual output curing fabric saving valuable AI processor resources and improving job completion time. I would like to now invite John McCool, our Chief Platform Officer, to describe our 2024 platform and supply chain innovations after a challenging couple of years. John, over to you. John McCool : Thank you, Jayshree. I'm pleased to report Arista 7700 R4 distributed Ecolink switch, the 7800 R4 Spine, along with the 7060 X6 AI leaf that we announced in June have entered into production providing our customers the broadest set of 800 gigabit per second Ethernet products for their AI networks. Together with 800 gigabit per second parallel optics, our customers are able to connect to 400 gigabit per second GPUs to each port increasing the deployment density over current switching solutions. This broad range of Ethernet platforms allows our customers to optimize density and minimize tiers to best match the requirements of their AI work. As our customers continue with AI deployments, they're also preparing their front-end networks. New AI clusters require new high-speed connections into the existing backbone. These new clusters also increased bandwidth on the backbone to access training data, capture snapshots and deliver results generated by the cluster. This trend is providing increased demand for 7800 R3 400-gigabit solution. While the post-pandemic supply chain has returned to predictability, lead times for advanced semiconductors remain extended from pre-pandemic levels. To assure availability of high-performance switching silicon, we've increased our purchase commitments for these key components. In addition, we will increase our on-hand inventory to respond to the rapid deployment of new AI networks and reduce overall lead times as we move into next year. Our supply chain team continues to work closely with planning to best align receipt of these purchases with expected customer delivery. Next-generation data centers integrating AI will contend with significant increases in power consumption while looking to double network performance. Our tightly coupled electrical and mechanical design flow allows us to make system-level design trade-offs across domains to optimize our solutions. Our experience in co-design with the leading cloud companies provides insight into the variety of switch configurations required for these tightly coupled data center environments. Finally, our development operating software with SDK integration, device diagnostics and data analysis supports a fast time to design and production with a focus on first-time results. These attributes give us confidence that we will continue to execute on our road map in this rapidly evolving AI networking segment. Back to you, Jayshree. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, John and congrats on a very high performance here to you and your new executives [indiscernible] and the entire team. You guys have really done a phenomenal job. Critical to the rapid adoption of AI networking is the Ultra Ethernet consortium specification expected imminently with Arista's key contributions as a founding member. The UEC ecosystem for AI has evolved to over 97 members. In our view, Ethernet is the only long-term viable direction for open standard space AI networking. Arista is building holistic AI centers powered by our unparalleled superiority of U.S. and the depth of automation and visibility software provided by CloudVision. Arista EUS delivers dynamic methods using cluster load balancing for congestion control and smart system upgrades where the traffic for AI continues to flow in the midst of an upgrade. Arista continues to work with AI accelerators of all types and we're agnostic to nice to bring advanced EOS visibility all the way down to the host. Shifting to 2025 goals. As we discussed in our New York Stock Exchange event in June, our TAM has expanded to $70 billion in 2028. And you know we've experienced some pretty amazing growth years with 33.8% growth in '23 and 2024 appears to be heading at least to 18%, exceeding our prior predictions of 10% to 12%. This is quite a jump in 2024, influenced by faster AI pilots. We are now projecting an annual growth of 15% to 17% and next year, translating to approximately $8 billion in 2025 revenue with a healthy expectation of operating margin. Within that $8 billion revenue target, we are quite confident in achieving our campus and by back-end networking targets of $750 million each in 2025 that we set way back 1 or 2 years ago. It's important to recognize though that the back end of AI will influence the front-end AI network and its ratios. This ratio can be anywhere from 30% to 100% and sometimes, we've seen it as high as 200% of the back-end network depending on the training requirements. Our comprehensive AI center networking number is therefore likely to be double of our back-end target of $750 million, now aiming for approximately $1.5 billion in 2025. We will continue to aim for double-digit annual growth and a 3-year CAGR forecast of teams in the foreseeable future of 2024 to 2026. More details forthcoming from none other than our Chief Financial Officer. So, over to you, Chantelle. Chantelle Breithaupt : Thank you, Jayshree. Turning now to more detail on the financials. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 fiscal year '24 is based on non-GAAP, it excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, intangible asset amortization and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues reached $1.81 billion, marking a 20% year-over-year increase. This strong performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 17% of revenues in the third quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in $330.9 million or 18.3% of total revenue down from 18.7% last quarter. This quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects an increased contribution from domestic shipments to our cloud and enterprise customers. Overall, gross margin in Q3 was 64.6%, above the upper range of our guidance of approximately 64%, down from 65.4% last quarter and up from 63.1% in Q3 prior year. This year-over-year improvement is driven by stronger enterprise margins and supply chain discipline in the current quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $279.9 million or 15.5% of revenue, down from last quarter at $319.8 million. R&D spending came in at $177.5 million or 9.8% of revenue, down from $216.7 million last quarter. An item of note is that there were additional R&D-related expenses originally expected in Q3 that are now expected to materialize in the Q4 quarter. R&D had increased low double-digit percentage versus Q3 in the prior year. Sales and marketing expense was $83.4 million or 4.6% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter. Our G&A costs came in at $19.1 million or 1.1% similar to last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $890.1 million or 49.1% of revenue. This was favorably impacted by the shift of R&D-related expenses from Q3 now anticipated in Q4 of this year. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $85.3 million and our effective tax rate was 21.1%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $769.1 million or 42.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 320.5 shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.40, up 31.1% from the prior year. This, too, was favorably impacted by the shift in R&D-related expenses from Q3 to Q4. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $7.4 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased $65.2 million of our common stock at an average price of $318.40 per share. Of the $1.2 billion repurchase program approved in May 2024, $1 billion remains available for repurchase of future quarters. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent upon market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Turning to operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated approximately $1.2 billion of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong earnings performance combined with favorable working capital results. DSOs came in at 57 days, down from 66 days in Q2, reflecting a strong collections quarter combined with contributions from linearity of billing. Inventory turns were 1.3x, up from 1.1% last quarter. Inventory decreased to $1.8 billion in the quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the prior period, reflecting a reduction in our raw materials inventory. Our purchase commitments and inventory at the end of the quarter totaled $4.1 billion, up from $4 billion at the end of Q2. We expect this number to continue to have some variability in future quarters as a reflection of demand for our new product introductions. Our total deferred revenue balance was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our product deferred revenue increased approximately $320 million versus last quarter. Fiscal 2024 continues to be a year of new product introductions, new customers and expanded use cases. These trends have resulted in even contracts with customer-specific acceptance clauses and has and will continue to increase the variability of magnitude of our product deferred revenue balances. Accounts payable days were 42 days, down from 46 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inner receipt payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. In October, we began our initial construction work to build expanded facilities in Santa Clara and we expect to incur approximately $15 million during Q4 for this project. Now, turning to the fourth quarter. Our guidance for the fourth quarter which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts, intangible asset amortization and other nonrecurring items is as follows : Revenues of approximately $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, gross margin of approximately 63% to 64%; operating margin of approximately 44%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% on with diluted shares of approximately 321 million shares on a pre-split basis. On the cash front, while we have experienced good increases in operating cash over the last couple of quarters, we anticipate an increase in working capital requirements in Q4. This is primarily driven by increased inventory in order to respond to the rapid deployment of AI networks and to reduce overall lead times as we move into 2025, mentioned in John's prepared remarks. We will continue our spending investment in R&D, go-to-market activities and scaling the company. Additionally, in Q4 as part of our ongoing commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders and enhancing the accessibility of our stock, we are pleased to announce that Arista's Board of Directors has approved a 4-for-1 [ph] stock split. This decision reflects our confidence in the continued growth and prospects of the company. It's important to note that while the stock split increases the number of shares outstanding, it does not change the intrinsic value of the company nor does it impact our financial performance or strategy. The split is designed to make our stock more accessible and attractive to a wider range of investors, particularly retail investors which we believe will ultimately support broader ownership and improve trading dynamics. Transitioning now to fiscal year 2025. As Jayshree mentioned, we are putting revenue growth of 15% to 17%. The expected revenue mix is forecasted to have an increased weighting of cloud and AI customers, placing the gross margin outlook at 60% to 62% and operating margin at approximately 43% to 44%. Our commitment remains to continue to invest in R&D, go-to-market and the scaling of the company as we forecast to reach approximately $8 billion in revenue in 2025. We reiterate our double-digit growth forecast in the foreseeable future and a 3-year revenue CAGR goal of mid-teens for fiscal year '24 through '26. We are excited by the current and future opportunities to serve our customers as the pure-play networking innovation company and to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz? Liz Stine : Thank you, Chantal. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. To allow for greater participation, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : A strong set of results, but if I can ask one on the guidance, if you don't mind. Jayshree, you're guiding here to the $750 million of TI target that you had issued previously and you're also guiding to sort of meet your campus revenue target. So if I take those two into account, it does imply that the ex-sort of AI and ex campus business is only growing single digits next year. This is on the sort of yields of coming through a double-digit year in 2024 where you comped backlog digestion in 2023. So just maybe have parse through that as to why there's a significant desecration [ph] in the non-AI sort of noncampus business implied in the numbers? And what maybe is driving that sort of -- in your expectations, what's driving that outlook? Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Samik. As you know, our visibility only extends to roughly about 6 months, right? So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves on how much better we can do and that's kind of how we started 24 either and we were pleasantly surprised with the faster acceleration of AI pilots. So we definitely see that our large cloud customers are continuing to refresh on the cloud, but are pivoting very aggressively to -- so it wouldn't surprise me if we grow faster in AI and faster in campus in the new center markets and slower in our classic markets called that data center and cloud. And this is the best we can see right now. It doesn't mean we couldn't do better or worse. But as far as our visibility goes, I think this represents a nice combination of all our different customer segments and all our different product sectors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Antoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. Antoine Chkaiban : Can you maybe provide an update on the 4 major AI trials that you gave in the past? How are things progressing versus your expectations as of 90 days ago. And when do you expect the move to production to happen? And what kind of scale are we talking about? Jayshree Ullal : That's a good question. Arista now believes we're actually 5 out of 5, not 4 out of 5. We are progressing very well in 4 out of the 5 clusters. 3 of the customers are moving from trials to pilots this year, inspecting those 3 to become 50,000 to 100,000 GPU clusters in 2025. We're also pleased with the new Ethernet trial in 2024 with our fifth customer. This customer was historically very, very InfiniBand driven. And we are now moving in that particular fifth customer, we are largely in a trial mode in 2024 and we hope to go to pilots and production. There is 1 customer who -- so 3 are going well. One is starting. The fifth customer is moving slower than we expected. They may get back on their feet. In 2025, they're awaiting new GPUs and they've got some challenges on power cooling, et cetera. So three, I would give an A. The fourth one, we're really glad we won and we're getting started and the fifth one, I'd say, steady state, not quite as great as we would expect -- have expected them to be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : NVIDIA in the last quarter the launch of the Spectrum X, it shows that in data center switching their market share went from like 4% to 15%. Does it mean that you're seeing increased competition from NVIDIA? And is it competing with you on the same spot? Or is it more competing with white boxes? And the second question is about white boxes. What is the outlook for white box participation in Gen AI? Is it going to be higher or lower than in front-end data centers? Jayshree Ullal : Okay, thanks, Tal, which question do you want me to answer? Tal Liani : Let's go with NVIDIA. Give me the gift of... Jayshree Ullal : Somebody else may ask the question anyway. So you'll get your answer. But just to answer your question on NVIDIA. First of all, we view NVIDIA as a good partner. If we didn't have the ability to connect to their GPUs, we wouldn't have all this AI networking demand. So thank you, NVIDIA -- thank you, Jensen, for the partnership. Now as you know, NVIDIA sells the full stack and most of the time, it's with InfiniBand and with the [indiscernible] acquisition, they do have some Ethernet capability. We personally do not run into the Ethernet capability very much. We run into it, maybe 1 or 2 customers. And so generally speaking, Arista has looked upon as the expert there. We have a full portfolio. We have full software. And whether it's the large scale-out Ethernet working customers like the Titans or even the smaller enterprises, we're seeing a lot of smaller GPU plus of enterprise, Arista is looked upon as the expert there. But that's not to say we're going to win 100%. We welcome NVIDIA as a partner on the GP and a fierce competitor and we look to compete with them on the Ethernet switching. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I'll tag team with Tal. So we'll partner once again here. I do want to sort of look at this competition or competitive landscape broadly. In that what I'm trying to understand is how it may be changing with the advent of AI, to not just hearing from you about white box but also competitors like Cisco and Juniper and Nokia. So really an update on the competitive landscape would be helpful. Jayshree Ullal : Thank you, Simon. That's a nice broad question. So since you asked me specifically about AI as opposed to cloud, let me parse this problem into 2 halves, the back end and the front end, right? At the back end, we're natively connecting to GPUs. And there can be many times, we just don't see it because somebody just muddles it in the GPU in particular, NVIDIA. And you may remember a year ago, I was saying we're outside looking in because most of the bundling is happening within [indiscernible], I would expect on the back end, any share Arista get, including that $750 million is incremental. It's brand new to us. We were never there before. So we'll take all we can get, but we are not claiming to be a market leader there. We're, in fact, claiming that there are many incumbents there with InfiniBand and smaller versions of Ethernet that Arista is looking to gain more credibility and experience and become the gold standard for the back end. On the front end, in many ways, we are viewed as the gold standard to competitively. It's a much more complex network. You have to build a leaf-spine architecture. John alluded to this, there's a tremendous amount of scale with L2, L3, EVPN, VXLAN, visibility, telemetry, automation routing at scale, encryption at scale. And this, what I would call accelerated networking portfolio complements NVIDIA's accelerated compute portfolio. And compared to all the peers you mentioned, we have the absolute best portfolio of 20 switches and 3 families and the capability and the competitive differentiation is bar none. In fact, I am specifically aware of a couple of situations where the AI applications aren't even running on some of the industry peers you talked about and they want to swap theirs for ours. So feeling extremely bullish with the 7,800 flagship product, the newly introduced 700 that we worked closely with Meta, the 7060, this product line running today mostly at 400 gig because a lot of the ecosystem isn't there for 800. But moving forward into 800, this is why John and the team are building the supply chain to get ready for it. So competitively, I would say, we're doing extremely well in the front end -- and it's incremental on the back end. So -- and overall, I would classify our performance in AI coming from being a now 12 years ago to where we are today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Ben Reitzes : I wanted to ask a little bit more about the $750 million in AI for next year. Has your visibility on that improved over the last few months. I wanted to reconcile your comment around the fifth customer not going slower than expected. And it sounds like you're now in 5 on 5, but wondering if that fifth customer going slower is limiting upside or limiting your visibility there? Or has it actually improved and it's gotten more conservative over the last... Jayshree Ullal : Somebody has to bring a conservative end, but I think we're being realistic. So I think you said it right. I think on 3 out of the 5, we have good visibility, at least for the next 6 months, maybe even 12. John, what do you think? John McCool : Yes. Jayshree Ullal : On the fourth one, we are in early trials, we got improving to do. So let's see, but we're not looking for 2025 to be the bang up year on the fourth one. It's probably 2026. And on the fifth one, we're a little bit stalled which may be why we're being careful about predicting how they'll do. They may step in nicely in the second half of '25, in which case, we'll let you know. But if they don't, we're still feeling good about our guide for '25. Is that right, Chantelle? Chantelle Breithaupt : I totally agree. It's a good question, Ben. But I think out of the 5 the way Jayshree categorized them, I would completely agree. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Karl Ackerman : Jayshree, could you discuss whether the programs are engaged with on hyperscalers? Will it be deploying your new EtonLink switches and AI spine products on 800-gig ports. In other words, have these pilots or trials been on 400 gig and production beyond 800 gig. And I guess if so, what's the right way to think about the hardware mix of sales of 800 gig in '25? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. That's a good question. I mean, just going back to again, it was always hard to tell that 100 and 400 because somebody can take their 400 and break it into breakouts of 100 -- so I would say today, if you ask John and I, a majority of the trials and pilots are on 400 because people are still waiting for the ecosystem at 800, including the NIC and the UEC and the packet spring capabilities, et cetera. So while we're in some early trials on 800, majority of 400. Majority of 2024 is 400 gig. I expect as we go into 25, we will see a better split between 400 and 800. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company. Ryan Koontz : I was hoping we could touch base on your campus opportunities a bit. Where are you seeing the most traction in terms of your applications? Is this primarily from your strength in kind of core moving big bits around the campus core or are you seeing WiFi? Can you maybe just update us on the campus applications and verticals you're seeing the most traction in? Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Ryan, let me try and step back and say -- tell you that our enterprise opportunity has never been stronger. As a pure-play innovator, we are getting invited more and more into enterprise deals even though sometimes we don't often have the sales coverage for it. And what I mean by that is, I think Arista is being sought for a network design that doesn't have 5 operating systems and different silos and not just the get code. And there's an awful lot of competitive fatigue and add to the fact that there's an awful lot of consolidation going on and a lot of our peers in the industry are looking at other things, whether it's observability or bringing other products together. So our enterprise opportunity now, we don't just characterize as data center; there's data center, there's campus center, there's WAN center and of course, there's a little bit of AI in there, too. So now let me address your campus question more specifically. Clearly, one of the first place as everybody went on our campus is the universal spine [ph]. They go, oh, okay, I can have the same spine from my data center and campus. This is so cool. So that activity has already started and a big part of our $750 million projection comes from the confidence that they've already put in a platform and a foundation to get ready for more spine. Then if Sanjay Kumar [ph], our VP, GM for Campus was here, he'd say, but Jayshree, you need to measure the edge ports which is the power Ethernet, the wired and the WiFi. And this is super important, John McCool you are smiling or laughing. John McCool : Sanjay Kumar. Jayshree Ullal : Sanjay Kumar, yes. And so he would say, you got to get that right. And so number one, we're in the spine; two, we're making stronger progress on the wired. Our weakest partly because we are data center folks and we're still learning how to sell radio is the WiFi that we plan to fix that and this is where the extra coverage will come in. So I would say more of our strength is coming into wired and spine. We are doing very well in pockets of WiFi, but we need to do better. Chantelle, you want to add something? Chantelle Breithaupt : Just to take the second part, I think you were asking about some of the verticals in your question. I just wanted to add some of the verticals. I think where we're seeing some strength data center and campus, I would say financials, health care, media, retail, Fed and sled [ph]. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, Fed and sled [ph], that's a good one. This is historically an area we have not paid attention to the federal market we're getting very serious about, including setting up its own subsidiary. So Chantelle, you've been a huge part of pushing us there. So, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess I'm hoping you could spend some time on the sizable acceleration we're seeing both on your total deferred number, but also the product deferred number is going up pretty dramatically. Jayshree, historically, when product default goes up in such a dramatic manner, you actually end up with really good revenue [ph] in the out years and you're guiding for revenue that you decelerate in '25. Maybe just help me connect like what's the delta, why product different what makes the acceleration that we historically has. Jayshree Ullal : I'm going to let Chantelle the expert answer the question, but I will say one line. Remember, in the case of those examples you're quoting, the trials were typically, I don't know, 6 to 12 months this can be multiple years and can take a lot longer to manifest. It may not all happen in 2025. Over to you, Chantelle. Chantelle Breithaupt : I think, yes. So thank you, Jayshree. So part of it is the type of use case, the type of customers, the mix of product that goes in there, they all have bespoke time frames, Jayshree referred to, you're starting to see those lengthen. And the other thing, too, is that this is what we know now as you move through every quarter, there are deferred in and out. So this is what we know at this time. And it's a mix of the variables that we told you before. And then as we move through '25, we'll continue to update. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Jayshree, I just wanted to get a sense of, clearly, you keep -- clearly have these 4 main trials and have added a fifth. But just how are you thinking about kind of adding other either Tier 2 opportunities or sovereigns or just kind of some of these other customers that are investing heavily in AI and kind of how do you see those opportunities developing those for Arista? Jayshree Ullal : This is a good question. So we're not saying these are the [indiscernible]. But these are the 5 we predict can go to 100,000 GPUs and more. That's the way to look at this. So there are largest AI titans, if you will. And they can be in the cloud, hyperscaler Titan group, they could be in the Tier 2 as well, by the way, very rarely would they be in a classic enterprise. By the way, we do have at least 10 to 15 trials going on in the classic enterprise too, but they're much smaller GPU counts, so we don't talk about it. So we're folding on the big 5 to the point that they really skew our numbers and they're very important to establish our beachhead, our innovation and our market share in AI, but there's definitely more going on. In terms of specifically your question on Tier 2 and will there be more there will be more, but these are the 5 we see in that category and they're spread across both the Tier 1 Titan Cloud as well as the Tier 2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sebastien Naji with William Blair. Sebastien Naji : Yes. Just specifically on the Ethernet or Etherlink [ph] portfolio, could you maybe rank order or comment on what you see as the opportunity across each of the 3 families a single-tier lease spine and then the tolling switch as we're going into 2025 and beyond. Jayshree Ullal : I'll take a crack at it, but John helped me out here because this is clearly a guestimate. It's probably 1 we should say no comment, but we'll try to give you color. On the Etherlink [ph], I would say the fixed 7060 switches in terms of units are very popular because it's a single switch. It's 1 our customers are familiar with. It's based on an intense partnership with Broadcom. So we've done Tomahawk 1, 2, 3, 4 and here we are on 5, right? So I would say, volume-wise, that's the big one. Going into the other extreme, the 7800 in volume may be smaller, but in dollars, is extremely strategic and this is where we feel competitively again, working with our partners in Broadcom with the Jericho and [indiscernible] family. This is just -- what would you say, John, a real flagship, right? John McCool : Yes, that\u2019s right. Jayshree Ullal : In dollars, that's the stealer, if you will. And then the 7,700 is kind of the best of both worlds that gives you all the capabilities of the 7,800 in a mini configuration up to 10,000 GPUs. It's brand new. So -- but I think it's going to -- and competitively, there's no peer for this. Nobody else does this, but us with a scheduled fabric in a single stage. We did this in a very close collaboration, John, with Meta, right? So you guys have been working together, John, for 18 months, 2 years, I would say. So I think we know less about how to qualify that, but it could be very promising and it could be a fast accelerator in the next couple of years. John McCool : Yes, I can. Jayshree Ullal : Just to add to that, John? John McCool : 7,700; yes, people are interested in the very large scale is attractive for the 700. Between the 7060 and the 7800, we do see people that are optimizing a mix of both of those products in the same deployment so they can get the minimum number of tiers but have the maximum amount of GPUs that fit their use case. So we do see a lot of tailoring now around the size of the deployments based on how many GPUs they want to deploy their data center. Jayshree Ullal : Yes, that's a really good point. And then suddenly, they'll go, okay, I want to go from a 4-way rates to an 8 way. And then suddenly, you have to add more line cards in your 7,800 and come running to you for more supply chain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to kind of segue off the competitive landscape and just ask you about when I look at your 2025 outlook as well as the midterm model that you provided, it looks like you're making some assumptions of some margin declines. I'm curious of what's underlying those expectations of gross margin declines? Is it mix of customers? Do you expect multiple 10% plus customers in 2025? Just any help on what's factored into that -- those margin expectations? Chantelle Breithaupt : I would say, absolutely and the outlook that you referred to, it is customer mix. We're expecting John to continue the great supply chain discipline that he's been doing with his team. So it is a BIC comment only. And as for the 10% customers, I would say the one dynamic, maybe it's a bit cheeky to say it as the denominator gets bigger, that gets a bit tougher. So we'll see as we go in the out years. But right now, we'll just keep to the sort of the ones that we currently talk about and we'll see how that goes from '25 and '26. Jayshree Ullal : It's going to get harder and harder to have 10 customers. So I believe M&M will still be that in 2025, but I don't anticipate there's any others at the moment. Liz Stine : Operator, we have time for 1 last question. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik : Jayshree, some the recent conferences, you've talked about every dollar spent on back end is at least 2x on the front end. What signs are you looking for to see the lift from AI on the front end or classic cloud from the pressure on the bandwidth. Jayshree Ullal : Yes. Listen, I think it all depends on Atif their approach to AI. If they just want to build a back-end cluster and prove something out, they just look for the highest job training completion and intense training models. And it's a very narrow use case. But what we're starting to see more and more like I said, is for every dollar spent in the back end, you could spend 30% more, 100% more and we've even seen a 200% more scenario which is why $750 million will carry over to, we believe, next year, another $750 million on front-end traffic that will include AI, but it will include other things as well, it won\u2019t be unique to AI. So I wouldn't be surprised if that number is anywhere between 30% and 100%, so the average is 100%, which is 2x back and over [ph]. So, feeling pretty good about that. We don't know how to exactly count that as pure AI which is why I qualify it by saying increasingly, if you start having inference, training, front-end, storage, WAN, classic cloud; all come together, the AI -- the pure AI number becomes difficult to track. Liz Stine : Thanks so much, all [ph]. This concludes the Arista Networks third quarter 2024 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our results which you can access on the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Arista. Operator : Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
