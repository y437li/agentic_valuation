Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty. Before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investors Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that we are definitely a new Constellation. The powerful combination of our existing wine and spirits business with our newly consolidated beer business, including our New Mexican brewery and the other 50% of Crown, adds an entirely new dimension to our company, one that adds size and scale and provides new avenues for growth. Since the closing of the beer deal less than a month ago, we have experienced a smooth transition for our new brewery in Mexico. Our beer supply chain is operating efficiently as we continue to make and move beer. And we are fully engaged in working collaboratively with all brewery employees, including the operations team in Mexico. Overall, we're off to a good start for the year on all fronts, with results that were generally in line with all of our expectations. During the first quarter, our U.S. wine and spirits business continue to gain marketplace momentum, posting strong consumer takeaway growth of 9% versus category growth of 3% in IRI channels. In terms of consumer takeaway by market channel, Constellation's wine portfolio outperformed the category overall due to solid growth across every channel. Overall, we continue to benefit from continuing consumer trade-up trends, distribution gains at retail and contributions from our brand-building efforts, with our Focus Brands depletions growing at more than double the rate of our total portfolio during the quarter. Now I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our key brand-building initiatives that were executed during the first quarter, including accolades received for some of our popular wines and spirits. The Dreaming Tree, which is one of our most successful new brand introductions to date, launched an everyday White Blend named after a song made famous by Dave Matthews. It is the perfect companion to the Crush Red Blend that was introduced last year. Building on the success of their frozen wine cocktails, Arbor Mist expanded and launched frozen spirits-style cocktails, including strawberry daiquiri, pi\u00f1a colada and lime margarita. Wine Enthusiasts recently awarded 90-plus points scores to several Ravenswood designate series Zinfandel wines. And the Robert Mondavi 2010 Napa Valley Fume Blanc recently received 91 points and the best buy accolade from Wine & Spirits Magazine. The month of June was dedicated to Robert Mondavi as heritage month as we celebrate his legacy and the 100th anniversary of his birth. Throughout the month, we featured special sales promotions, marketing campaigns and events for Robert Mondavi wines in an effort to celebrate his great contributions to the wine world, including many fine winemaking techniques and the creation of marketing and educational innovations that enhance the worldwide reputation of Napa Valley and California wines. We recently achieved an important milestone within our wine business by becoming the #1 wine producer and exporter of New Zealand wines with our award-winning portfolio of brands, including Kim Crawford, Nobilo and Monkey Bay. Throughout the last 52 weeks, these brands posted strong double-digit growth trends in the IRI channels. During the quarter, Kim Crawford also had the distinction of reaching the 1 million case mark in global sales over a 12-month period. From the spirits perspective, during the first quarter, both SVEDKA Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining market share of their respective market categories. Just in time for Memorial Day celebrations, we released SVEDKA Stars & Stripes 2, our limited-edition 1.75 liter party bottle, which will certainly come in handy for this week's 4th of July celebrations. SVEDKA has become the #2 imported vodka and the #3 vodka overall in the U.S. It also recently moved up to #7 on Impact magazine's list of top 10 distilled spirits brands in the U.S. We also recently launched the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which can be enjoyed straight, on the rocks or blended in a handcrafted cocktail and is priced at a premium versus our base Black Velvet brand. The cinnamon flavor category in whisky is currently on fire, experiencing triple-digit growth trends. Moving to Crown Imports in our beer business. For the first quarter of 2014, Crown posted its 13th consecutive quarter of share gains and outperformance of the total U.S. beer industry and imported beer category, gaining almost 1 point of volume share of the import category. This was the result of excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays. Modelo Especial continues to be the shining star of the portfolio, posting double-digit sales in depletion growth trends during the quarter. Collectively, Corona Extra and the entire Modelo portfolio posted depletion trends that exceeded the overall U.S. beer market in the first quarter, benefiting from increased marketing investments, which include : Corona Extra launched 4 new Find Your Beach advertisements, reinforcing Corona's leadership position, demonstrating that finding your beach can be a state of mind, as well as a physical place. Corona Light also launched a new advertising campaign during the quarter that encourages consumers to trade up from domestic lights. You may remember some of these spots that we showed at our recent Investor Meeting featured the talking sheep, which encouraged consumers to ditch the herd. Overall, this brand is outpacing the imported light category in IRI channels. Following Cinco activities, we launched the \"Live it. Share it. Win it.\" summer promotion for Corona Extra and Corona Light, which is supported by new TV and digital spots. Modelo Especial has new creative for both Hispanic and general market consumers that plays to the beer's authenticity. Collectively, the initiatives I have just outlined contributed to Crown's strong marketplace momentum as the business grew depletions by approximately 3% in the first quarter despite a difficult comparison overlap from last year's first quarter. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown plans to launch Modelo Especial Chelada by early fall, which is expected to build in the brand strength of Modelo Especial. This product will tap into a new occasion with this brand's core Hispanic consumer. Crown is planning draft format expansions for Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico in select markets. Corona Light will also sponsor Kenny Chesney's 2013 U.S. tour, leveraging Kroger as the strategic retail partner through its Rhythms & Brews program. Pacifico will debut its first TV ads in Southern California. The new Pacifico, discovered in Baja, imported by surfers, campaign includes several TV ads that celebrate the brand's surfing origins and adventure-seeking consumers. And finally, during fiscal 2014, chef Rick Bayless will work with Crown to promote Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria, creating recipes and unique food pairing options for each brand that can be leveraged at retail. In closing, from an operational perspective, we are off to a positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer, wine and spirits businesses in IRI channels. I am particularly pleased that we have closed the beer deal and that a smooth transition is underway at our new brewery in Mexico. As you know, we have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation, and we expect to continue in these areas throughout the remainder of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter results. Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q1 came in at $0.38. At a high level, this result was generally in line with our expectations, and we are reiterating, or in the case of EPS, improving our full year guidance. We're pleased with our marketplace results as our wine, spirits and beer businesses continue to gain share in IRI for the quarter from our brand-building investments, innovation efforts and retail execution. For Q1, sales growth did not translate to higher EBIT due primarily to some timing items. In a few moments, I will highlight some additional timing and comparison impacts for Q2. As a result, we expect this year's profit growth to be generated in the back half of the year. Given those highlights, let's look at Q1 performance in more detail quarter, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 4%, primarily due to higher shipment volume. We saw shipments outpace depletions in the quarter as our U.S. domestic depletion volume growth was a little above 2%. In Q2, we expect this shipment benefit to reverse, and we expect depletion growth to be quite a bit higher than Q1. As a reminder, from time-to-time, we will see fluctuations in growth trends between shipments and depletions on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to various factors like timing of new product introductions and promotional activities. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to expect shipments and depletions to generally align on an annual basis. The acquisition of Mark West provided contribution to our total growth as total net sales for the quarter increased 6%. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 38.3% versus 39.6% for the prior year quarter. This reflect -- this result reflects an increase in COGS, driven primarily by higher grape cost. Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $5 million to $128 million as sales growth was more than offset by the impact of higher grape and SG&A costs. The increase in SG&A was in line with our expectations and reflects compensation increases and commercial investments in the business. We expect to continue to see higher SG&A as we move through the year from this activity, along with planned marketing investment behind initiatives for some of our key focus brands. Corporate costs increased less than $1 million for the quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million versus $61 million last year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $762 million, an increase of 5%; and operating income of $134 million, an increase of 9%. The net sales and operating increase was primarily driven by volume growth, led by strong double-digit growth of Modelo Especial and the benefit of increased product pricing taken in select U.S. markets last fall. Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up 8% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position, which saw quite a bit of activity during Q1 related to the financing of the beer transaction. At the end of May, our total debt was just over $5 billion. This represents a $1.8 billion increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2013. The increase reflects some of the permanent financing that was executed in May in advance of the completion of the $4.75 billion beer business acquisition that closed on June 7th. This included $500 million of 3.75% senior notes due in 2021, $1 billion of 4.25% senior notes due 2023 and about $221 million drawn from our accounts receivables securitization and other revolving facilities. We funded the remainder of the purchase price with cash, term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which were not drawn or utilized until after the close of the first quarter. The timing of this financing activity could not have been better. Our improved credit profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us put in place an attractive financing package with an all-in interest rate just under 3%. This was better than our original expectations. And as a result, we now expect interest expense for the year to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million versus our original $345 million to $355 million projection. We still do not have full visibility to the timing of the brewery cash flows, and the current interest rate outlook remains quite volatile. Right now, this is our best estimate. We also finished May with $609 million of cash on our balance sheet and a little over $1.5 billion of restricted cash. The higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the building funds and drawing against our AR securitization facility for the beer acquisition activities. The restricted cash relates the senior note issuances I just outlined. After factoring in the cash and restricted cash, our net debt at the end of May was $2.9 billion, and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at about 3.2x. Our comparable base effective tax rate came in at 36.2% for Q1, and this was essentially even with the prior year Q1 rate. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we used $19 million of free cash flow, which compares to $77 million of free cash flow generation for Q1 of last year. The decrease was primarily due to funding beer transaction-related costs, higher interest expense payments and the impact of GAAP reporting on equity-based compensation. Our cash flow statement reflects excess cash benefits realized from stock benefit compensation awards as a reduction of cash from operating activities, offset by a benefiting cash from financing activities. So for the quarter, there is no net impact to our cash position, but there is a negative impact on our reported free cash flow. This is not a new reporting requirement, but it is noteworthy this quarter as we have seen a significant number of option exercises, given the substantial appreciation in our stock price over the past year. While the accounting and reporting for this area is very technical, the tax benefit associated with this activity ultimately reduces the income taxes paid by the company. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90 a share. This represents a $0.05 increase versus our previous guidance and is being driven by the lower interest expense projection I outlined earlier. This projection excludes any acquisition accounting impact. We continue to forecast free cash flow in the range of $475 million to $575 million. For our wine and spirits business, we continue to target organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and low to mid-single digit operating income growth. For the beer business, Crown continues to target depletions and net sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Operating income for Crown before any benefits from beer manufacturing and brand right profits is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. We do not have any updates to our previous discussions related to the fiscal '14 incremental benefits that we are targeting from the beer manufacturing and brand rights profit stream. Our guidance also continues to assume a tax rate of 37% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 199 million. I would like to note that from a gaining perspective, we expect fiscal 2014 Q2 EBIT performance for wine and spirits to come in below Q2 of fiscal 2013. As mentioned earlier, we saw shipments in Q1 outpace depletions, and we expect this shipment benefit to reverse in Q2. We also expect a portion of our planned incremental marketing investments for some of our key Focus Brands to occur in Q2. From a Crown perspective, this is before any brewery or brand owner benefits, we expect operating growth in Q2 to be flattish versus Q2 last year. We are overlapping Q2 fiscal 2013 income from an early termination payment related to the St. Pauli Girl distribution agreement. We also expect an increase in marketing expense in Q2 as marketing spend that historically occurred in the back half of the year is shifted into Q2 to further support the key summer selling season. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. The onetime costs associated with the beer transaction are expected to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. This includes approximately $50 million, primarily related to professional services and transition costs associated with the transaction, and $30 million of costs for financing-related fees. I would like to emphasize that the onetime costs and tax rate projections factored into the guidance I just highlighted are based on preliminary estimates. As noted earlier, our guidance excludes any acquisition accounting impact. While the purchase price allocation and acquisition accounting activities are underway, I would like to note that the disclosures related to this area in our upcoming 10-Q filing will be preliminary and subject to finalization. The initial purchase price for the beer transaction is $4.75 billion. This includes $1.85 billion for the remaining interest in Crown and $2.9 billion for the brewery and perpetual brand rights. As previously discussed, we estimate there will be a post-closing adjustment payment of approximately $560 million related to the brewery EBITDA calculation. This payment is expected to occur about 12 months after close. The purchase price allocation is expected to result in a significant increase in goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. This includes a significant noncash gain from the revaluation of our original 50% ownership interest in Crown to reflect the newly established fair market value. This gain is essentially nontaxable. And as a result, we expect this accounting requirement to result in a very low reported effective tax rate for the year. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate a few key highlights as it relates to the completion of the beer transaction. This is truly transformational for us as it diversifies our consumer base, essentially doubles annual sales and significantly enhances operating profits and operating margins. The brewery expansion activities over the next 3 years should position us for additional beer margin enhancement opportunities. Although our leverage will move above 5x range when factoring in a full year of acquisition earnings, we expect to focus on debt paydown to delever at a good pace, and we expect to be below 4x in approximately 2 years. As we delever and complete the brewery expansion, we expect to see a dramatic increase in our free cash flow generation. This should provide us with significant financial and capital allocation flexibility. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the grape cost, both in the quarter and kind of looking forward. And when I'm looking at gross margin, was the decline year-over-year almost all because of the higher grape cost or was there a higher promotion? And then would you expect this type of impact throughout 2014 or should it ease as we get to the back end? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so I'll take that in pieces. So the grape cost flowing through the cost of goods sold this year are pretty much as expected, right, as we -- because the last 2 harvests in California, specifically the cost per ton had gone up, though that juice will be flowing through our cost of goods sold over the next year to 2. So the cost of goods sold is up. But to your point, for the quarter, promotion spending was up a bit, mostly due to some of the timing of the shipments versus depletions. For the full year, we don't expect promotion spending to be up except for the impact of positive mix. So do we do expect cost of goods sold to be up for the year, and that was part of our guidance. We do not expect promotion spending on a mix adjusted basis to be up for the full year, but we did have a reasonable amount of quarter-over-quarter volatility. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then just on the beer side, was there any impact in terms of weather on the overall top line? And then have you seen any change as weather has improved in the summer? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so that's a great question. And we're very happy with our beer results. We outpaced the industry again for the 13th consecutive quarter. That being said, our results on the East Coast and in the Midwest were not very good because the weather for the spring has actually been very wet and very cold, and that's overlapping the previous year, where the weather was actually beyond ideal. So the whole beer industry had a very good first quarter last year. This year, we're all kind of suffering. We're not unique in that. But in general, we're doing better than most. And we're hoping for better weather as we come into the peak summer season, which is right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi. Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I wanted to circle back on the commentary about the reversals in terms of the shipments and depletions. I guess, I was a little surprised to hear that you get a full reversal in the second quarter. Because it looks like in the wine business, your shipments have been running ahead of depletions for 4 or 5 quarters now. It wasn't just kind of a 1Q '14 event. So can you dig a little deeper into that? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Vivien, the quarter-over-quarter thing gets a little confusing and complicated to describe, especially when you're talking changes, right, because you have to take 2 years activities into account. But the way we look at it is there is volatility quarter-over-quarter, but it kind of clears up on an annual basis. So I think if you go back and look at last year, for the full fiscal year, shipments and depletions were pretty much in line, actually they have been for the last few years. But the quarter volatility does exist. Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Bill's question about promotional spending. As I look at -- and I don't have the IRI data that you guys note. I'm using Nielsen AOC. But it looks to me that after significant easing in category level promotional spending, that's really kind of eased off and actually picked up recently. So I'm curious whether you're seeing that on a category basis in IRI, if you're seeing a shift in promotional spending from your competitive set. Robert P. Ryder: We feel we're spending in line with the industry. Again, a lot of our growth is coming out of the premium IRI segment, right, and we're making a concerted effort to get behind some of our brands there. And we're certainly spending more of our money on Focus Brands. But I think Q1 wouldn't be reflective of what we expect for the full year, especially when you look at some year-over-year indices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I have a follow-up question on the difference between depletions and shipments in wine and spirits. I think you said in the second quarter, your depletions would improve significantly from up 2%, so I guess maybe up 4% or something like that. Could you, first of all, comment on why that improves? And then if there's a reversal, does that mean your shipments are up 2%? Robert P. Ryder: Yes. And again, it can drive you a little bit crazy quarter-over-quarter. So the second quarter will kind of even out some of the anomalies in the first quarter because there'll be a reversal of the trends. So shipment growth, right, will be a lot less than depletion growth in the second quarter, which was the opposite in the first quarter. And again, for the full year, they should align. So our income statement is driven off shipment growth, which is why we said that the wine and spirits business will see profits in the second quarter below the second quarter of last year. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And why do depletions accelerate? Robert P. Ryder: So again, they just happen in different cadences, right, so depletions will accelerate. Some of it will do what happen with last year's second quarter. But the other will be as we gear up going into October, November, December, right, we expect to have better depletion results in the second quarter. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And why does depletion get better? Is it just the timing of your marketing? Robert S. Sands: Yes, this is Rob. What really happens is that at the end of the fourth quarter, or I should say the fourth quarter, we had very, very, very strong depletions. That tends to mute depletion growth in the first quarter of this year as the inventory from -- at retail from the fourth quarter moves through. That moves through during the first quarter and, therefore, the second quarter we usually see bounce back to our normal depletion trends of -- at least around mid-single-digit depletion growth. So fourth quarter, we had very high depletion growth, almost double digit. First quarter, we have lower depletion growth, low-single digits. Next quarter, we return to sort of our normal run rate. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. I mean, I suppose, in the second quarter, your depletions could be up 6% and your shipments still up 4%. Right? Robert S. Sands: In the second quarter, you're saying? Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Yes. Robert S. Sands: Yes, we're not going to comment on the exact numbers, which, of course, we don't know at this moment. Robert P. Ryder: But remember, from a shipment perspective, right, we said that shipment growth over prior year will drive negative EBIT in the second quarter. So I wouldn't expect shipment growth in the second quarter. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : All right. No shipment growth at all? Robert P. Ryder: Well, again, we're -- let's move on because we're kind of filling out economic models. We're just trying to do a favor giving some hints on second quarter. [indiscernible] Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And can you comment on price mix in the wine business in the first quarter? I think your volume was up 5.4 and your price mix was a negative 1.4, and why would that be since... Robert P. Ryder: Yes, that's a good question. So again, in the first quarter, we had some anomalies. I'd say price mix in the U.S. business, which usually really drives the bus, was slightly positive, okay? So that -- and if you look at the wine category, the trend continues, generally, the more expensive the wine, the faster it's growing. That was kind of consistent for us. But the anomaly in the first quarter was actually we had some negative price mix outside of the U.S., which it's normally not big enough to have an impact, but this quarter, because the first quarter's our smallest quarter and because it was a bit anomalous in -- mostly it was Canada and New Zealand, it kind of impacted the total business. Again, we don't expect that to be a full year phenomenon, which is a kind of anomalous first quarter event. So most of the negative price mix, actually all the negative price mix was outside of the United States. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And then my final question is on the beer category in the May quarter. Can you tell us what you think the growth was and when it was on premise as opposed to future consumption? Robert S. Sands: Yes. In the first quarter, the total beer category was down in volume terms about 1%, 1.5% versus our depletions, which, in the first quarter, were up 3%. In general, the trends in on-premise are worse than the trends in off-premise. It's hard to know exactly what the on-premise trends are because they're not tracked. So we don't know exactly what those numbers are, except that we expect that they're probably, as I said, worse in the on-premise than in the off-premise. Now as it relates to the beer business overall, the negative trends were largely driven by the domestic premium segment, which, of course, is dominated by the light premium beers of the 2 major brewers of domestic brands in the United States. The import category generally outperformed the domestic category. We represent about half of the import category, and as I said in my remarks, we gained about 1 point or 100 basis points of share of the import category, and we gained about around 20 basis points or so of the overall beer business in the United States. So generally, those are the trends. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: A couple of questions. On the wine business, you talked about the incremental, I guess, SG&A. I don't know if you're willing to give this, but I mean, how much are we talking that, that part of the wine business should be up in fiscal '14? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so the numbers that you see in SG&A are a combination of SG&A and marketing, right? And for the full year, we expect marketing to be up as we reinvest in the -- in mostly, the commercial activities, right, and mostly marketing spend. But SG&A would be up as well. The big drivers are normal raises, okay? They're kind of CPI inflation kind of numbers as we come off -- as we fully capitalize our ERP system, we have some increased depreciation around that. And then there's some overlaps from positives we incurred last year that aren't recurring this year that make SG&A looks like it's inflating, but it's really not. It's just overlapping anomalous positives in the previous year. They're the 3 big drivers for the SG&A increase. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: And so would you -- I mean, I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but would you say, I mean mid-single digits, would that be off base to make that sort of assumption for that part of the business? Robert P. Ryder: No, I mean you can see it in the P&L, right? I think SG&A was up like 7%, 8%, something like that, I think, in the P&L. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: I'm sorry, I was talking for the full year, not for the first quarter, how much it normalizes over the back end of the year? Robert P. Ryder: I would say that the full year will be a little bit less, but pretty much right around where the first quarter was. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Okay. And then, I guess an unrelated topic, throughout the quarter, we've gotten an announcement on the wine in Brazil and SVEDKA, I think it was, whatever, it was yesterday or last week in South Korea. Can you just talk about sort of the strategy there? Are we likely to see more and more of this in the near future? Is this kind of a much longer build? Robert S. Sands: Well, when you say more of this, what we announced in both cases was the appointment of new distributors. So around the world, whenever we appoint a new distributor for our brand, and these were just changes, so we've distributed in our brands with another distributor prior to this, whenever we appoint a new one, we usually issue a release indicating who our new customer is. So you'll continue to see, as we make adjustments in our distributions matrix, you'll see announcements announcing who our distributors are around the world. So that's really the sole import of all this. Now, as a general proposition, yes, we continue to focus on building our business in regions and countries around the world. We basically distribute every place in the world, largely. And as our brands build momentum, we make adjustments in that distributorship network, and these announcements sort of are fairly reflective of that. Brazil is a fairly bouyant market for imports so, of course, we're relatively optimistic about that business on a small base. So is South Korea, but again, on a very small base. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC. Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division : My question goes back to the Beer business. We've heard a lot over the last couple of years of you gaining share and Modelo portfolio growing faster than the U.S. beer industry. But with that said, during that time period, you've not taken pricing or now, we're seeing some minimal pricing coming through. So just curious to get your thoughts on the ability to take more pricing, are you willing to give up some volume and take that pricing? Or you think the market's just not ready to accept that yet? Robert S. Sands: Well, first of all, Lauren, last year, we took about 2% of pricing, which is, on a percentage basis, lower than the industry, but on a dollar basis, pretty much consistent with what the rest of the industry did, right? Because you remember, our price for our product is substantially higher than the industry, in general. So on nominal terms, the same price increase results in a lower percentage for us versus the rest of the industry. So 2% was pretty healthy. That's point number one. Yes, prior to that, there was a period of time for a few years where we really didn't take much pricing because the focus of the business was largely against making sure that we maintained and, in fact, build market share following the recession of 2008, early 2009. As far as our plans going forward, we expect to continue to monitor what's going on in the industry in general, and we take a very strategic view towards pricing and really look at it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. And we're going to have to wait and see what happens with the rest of the industry as we move forward, but it looks like, up to now at least, pricing's been pretty healthy in the rest of the industry. So I suppose stay tuned for -- we'll see what happens. Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division : Yes. And I guess as a follow-up, and I guess you did address this at your Analyst Day, but now that you're 100% owners of the Beer business, I know this is a very broad question, but any comments you'd like to make as far as things that may be done differently in beer that you may have not been able to do with a partner that you're excited about that could bring a great opportunity over the next couple of years? Robert S. Sands: Sure. Well, probably the biggest area that we're excited about is the opportunities for innovation and new product development. With the ownership of our own production, we can produce new packages and new types that previously we were entirely reliant upon the consent of Modelo to produce. And generally, they didn't really want to do much in the way of innovation, new products, new packages, new types. No less, new brands. So we're doing a lot of thinking about what our NPD and innovation pipeline will be in the future. We already are taking advantage of it. We've intro-ed or we're test marketing, Modelo Especial Lite. We are introducing Modelo Especial Chelada, which is a Bloody Mary style beer, which is actually a pretty large category in the United States. It's dominated entirely by one other supplier, so we see a lot of opportunity there. We are introducing new SKUs in drafts that we haven't previously had. So the primary area where we can really kind of do something different than what we have historically done is in the area of innovation and NPD. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a question about the wine business. If you look at, I guess, 5 or 6 quarters ago, you made the decision to ramp up or increase your marketing and promotional investment with the aim of holding or gaining market share, which you've been successful at. And I guess when you look at it, where you stand today, are you happy with the return on a net -- on that investment, first? And then now going forward, you feel like you have the right balance between spending on new product innovation, spending on advertising and marketing, and spending on promotion, or will there be any sort of tweaks to that mix going forward? Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think that certainly, right now, we feel like we have the right mix of those items. And yes, we have been successful in driving share. Our goal is not just to drive share. I'll say as a complete and total end goal, it's really about making sure that our brands are healthy so that we can take advantage of trends as they emerge. Now, as we move forward in the future, I am sure, in fact, we will tweak the mix between those things. And of course, in the end, our goal is to drive profitability and margins, but we really have to make sure, first and foremost, that the top line is healthy before we could turn our attention to that. So we'll definitely continue to tweak the mix between those things, and especially as we sort of monitor what's going on in the industry as we move into our next fiscal year and thereafter. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And if I could just follow up, if you look at the industry, the dynamic that's played out over the last year or so is that you've had -- the industry has been pricing at the value end of the category where you don't really participate. But I -- our impression is that helped maybe drive some mix benefit, drive consumers into the next price tiers. Just based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed in that dynamic? Is there still firm pricing at the value end of the category? And would you expect that to continue? Robert S. Sands: Not much has changed. The pricing is almost all at the low end, but that's not the surprising because the low end is the least fragmented part of the category, dominated largely by 2 suppliers. It has very much impacted the volume growth in the low end, so the pricing was not without some impact on volume, actually, fairly significant. It has driven some trade up. We are seeing more pricing, I suppose, at the top end sort of above $15, $20 as wine supplies, especially in the above $20 category, which is largely the North Coast Sonoma/Napa wine supplies have been very tight up there. So there has been some pricing there. The, I'll say, more commercial part of the business between $5 and $15 is much more fragmented, so we tend not to see pricing occur in that category or in that -- those segments as quickly as it occurs in the other 2 segments, but I would say, over time, we probably expect to see some pricing start hitting in those categories. And we have seen it in some specific brands. We've seen some pricing being taken, and some specific suppliers have taken some pricing in that category. But I would say not overall as a general proposition. Operator : Your next question is coming from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a quick question here. You talked about the on-premise being a little bit weaker for the Beer business, and one of the things you're focusing on with Corona Light is more of a draft presence than getting tap handles. So does this change and do we need to see the on-premise reaccelerate before we see the payoff on this? Or is this something where you think you've got enough momentum behind the brand that even if on-premise remains a little bit weak, you can still drive some decent growth off of that? Robert S. Sands: Yes, we are -- in our business, draft is a very, very, very small percentage of our business, about 2%, yes. Well, for us, it's even less -- I'm sorry, it's even less than 2%. But for the industry overall, it's a much higher percentage, so we under index grossly when it comes to draft. So regardless basically of what happens on the on-premise as an overall proposition, because we're so under indexed, it's a big opportunity for us. Now, that said, the strategy on draft is really all about providing the opportunity on, on premise for sampling of our products, and -- which translates directly into off premise volume and sales growth. So I don't think that the opportunity there has much to do with what's going on in the on-premise in general at all. It's all about we have traditionally just simply not participated in this segment. So the growth opportunity is quite substantial for us even without the on-premise generally growing. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, John. The on-premise, as Rob said, is not growing. We feel we are growing in the on premise in our Beer business, right? As Rob said, the numbers aren't really like incredibly nuclear, but we feel we're growing pretty well in draft. Draft is helping it, and actually, we have some tests that said when draft is on the account and people can see the tap handle, they'll actually also buy the bottle brand as well, right? So it's kind of synergistic in that way. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then one sort of quick follow-up here. You talked about the wine EBIT being below last year. Shipments below depletions, is the margins -- should we expect the margins to be down sort of a similar amount in Q2 versus Q1 roughly similar from that standpoint? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so we would expect margin erosion again in the second quarter because remember, I said that our profit growth is back-end weighted, right? So I don't think we'll see the -- for the full year, our guidance is for margin erosion in the wine and spirits business because we have operating profit growth estimated below net sales growth. But I think you're seeing an anomalously negative margin in the front half, which will start to come back in the second half of the year. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. So -- but Q2 probably somewhat similar to Q1 though? Robert P. Ryder: Probably. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with ISI. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Guys, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you think is driving incredibly strong beer performance. I mean last year, everything went right. I mean the weather was amazing, I mean you've -- the timing of the holidays was great. You had incredibly difficult comps. This year, the weather couldn't have been worse. I mean as you tread objectively, kind of look back in terms of what you're doing right in the marketplace on an execution side and marketing side, can you give us any sense of what you think is driving these incredibly impressive results on the beer side? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Robert. Thank you for that complement. I hope everybody heard that. I hope our Beer business guys heard that. But look, if you talk brands, right, the current juggernaut is Modelo Especial. And it continues -- it's above 40 million cases, which is a substantial brand, and it continues to grow on the 20% range. So I think that's the big buy brand section. I think the other thing that's happening is the import category's doing better than premiums or the sub-premiums, that's helping. And I think our marketing continues to resonate with the consumer, and the strong equity continues to resonate with the consumer. And very good sales execution. So I'd say not any one thing. One brand is clear, it is Modelo Especial. And then it's good execution around everything else. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Terrific. And Bob, as you continue to have more conversations with your leading retail customers about the new shape of your portfolio and kind of the increased importance of your portfolio at a lot of the retailers, can you give us any sense of how those discussions are going, whether you think you now have, obviously, a bigger seat at the table, you'll have more shelf space possibly going forward? Any color around that? Robert S. Sands: Yes, Robert. We definitely have a bigger seat at the table. As I've commented before, total beverage alcohol is probably the most important category at retail, especially in the chain and mass merchandisers environment. And as one of the largest multi-category players or the largest multi-category player and third largest category player overall, that puts us on a very important position. So our conversations with these retailers are good, and we hope to translate our position into a better position in these retailers. So that's something that we're always working on and yes, we're making progress. We have increased points of distribution in both wine, spirits and beer. So we think that we should be seeing continued favorable trends as a result of this. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Terrific. And then just one last question. Can you give us an update on where you see kind of currency potentially affecting results this year? And are you doing any hedging of any of your peso-based costs? How should we be thinking about that in the second half of the year? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so we do, do hedging. We hedge currencies and we hedge fuel prices, are currently what we're hedging. We do not yet hedge the peso because we don't have enough data from the new business to enter into those contracts. We are looking at it, and I would expect us to start hedging the peso as we go forward. The dollar's strengthened versus the peso, but it's been very volatile. And so we're keeping our eye on it. Right now, it looks better than it did a month ago, but again, it's very volatile. Of course, the euro and dollar is very volatile as well, that's our other big exposure. And we're also hedging fuel prices, which actually, for us, and it's all around freight, is a bigger number than our exposure to currencies, okay? So I think that's what we look at going forward. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Sure. And just, I mean, so I just want to make sure I get this right. So any decrease in the peso is going to lower your cost, so that would be a benefit. Am I right about that? Robert P. Ryder: That's correct, yes. Because we... Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And can you give us like, I don't know, for a 10% decrease roughly on an annualized basis, what that could mean? Robert P. Ryder: No, it would -- I'm not going to give those numbers because, frankly, we're still investigating. But actually, we're not as exposed to the peso as you might think, mostly because if you go back through the myriad of contracts that we have, where the beer that we do not make, we're buying in dollars from InBev, right? So that's a big thing. Natural gas is generally priced in dollars. Natural gas fuels the plants. In addition, most of the global beer input costs, malt, barley, things like that, are also paid for in dollars. It's kind of like oil. So really, the big exposure we have in pesos is the cash cost at the facility, which is mostly labor costs, right? That's our exposure, which isn't as big as you would think it would be because remember how automated this facility is. So yes, we have peso exposure. It's not as big as you might think. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the question that we had at the Investor Day on the packaging side, and you had mentioned that there was a new packaging bottling plant that was being built in Piedras Negras, how far along is that plant in terms of -- is that plant actually in operation now? And if not, when do you think it will be operational? My understanding is, I guess, if ABI was to sell, that you have right of first refusal. Can give us any color around that situation? Robert P. Ryder: We -- that's InBev's plant, so we don't have any insights to it. But we currently aren't sourcing any glass from that, and that's really not on our radar screen right now. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. But it is in operation now? Robert S. Sands: No. To my knowledge, it is not in operation currently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Mullarkey with Morningstar. Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I have a follow-up on John's question concerning draft beer. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the rollouts in a few select markets. Are there currently supply-chain bottlenecks or strategic reasons why you don't want to do a more broad scale rollout of tap handles across America? And how do you foresee the mix of draft beer for you changing over the next 3 to 5 years? Will it be a steady creep-up or will it be a kind of a stair-step change once the bulk of the brewery expansion is done? Robert S. Sands: Yes, no, there's not -- there's really no, I would say, overall supply chain issues other than just getting the supply chain for draft beer on a large scale up and going, is a relatively complicated process because it involves producing a lot more or having a lot more kegs than you need. It involves having the infrastructure in place for delivering kegs and having kegs returned and so on and so forth. So there's no issue, and we will continue to build the business. I would say it's going to be, as opposed to like a gigantic step change, I think it will be a slower change as we continue to build the business from where we are currently, which is about 2 million cases out of 170 million. So I said 2% is actually closer to 1% to more of the industry average, which is around 10%. So it will be a slow build. Obviously, that's a lot of draft beer as we build towards those numbers. But our intention is to continue to build the business, and we are putting the infrastructure in place. And as we continue to -- as we build out the Piedras Negras brewery, we'll be doing so, making sure that we have that capacity in mind. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so just to follow up on Rob, our draft business is doubling, still small but doubling. This is logistically complex, but also, remember, we're trying to be very selective with the accounts that we go into. So we're at a higher end, mostly on our draft, right? So we might not get the full distribution that maybe a Bud Light or Coors Light will because we'll be a little bit more selective. But we're very happy with the progress so far, and I think it's a slow build, but I'll take a slow build if it's a doubling of the business every year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : This is Jesse Reinherz in for Mark. So a question on the SG&A spend. Sounds like we're going to see more of an uptick in marketing in 2Q than we saw in Q1. And then that's going to kind of level out in 3 or 4Q, you're going to be a little bit less than we saw in Q2. Is that correct? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, we're just trying to give you a hint towards Q2, so we're -- I'm not going to get into like quarterly guidance stuff on marketing spend. But marketing spend in Q1 was below prior year, and for the full year, it's going to be above prior year. Yes, so you'd expect balance of the year to be higher. Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then just on the decision to kind of take up marketing in second quarter, and I guess, beyond. Is this more of a proactive move or is this a symptom of you guys seeing increasing competition in wine and kind of trying to get behind that? Robert P. Ryder: No, it's nothing. I'd say in beer, it's maybe more conscious to move some marketing spend into the second quarter. It's probably a little bit of a bigger bet on baseball and probably driving some of our Hispanic marketing. And in wine, it's more just I don't think we're that anomalous from prior years, we're just increasing total marketing spending in wine. It just so happened that Q1 was a little bit lighter and that the balance of the year will be heavier than prior year. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just one quick finance question. You mentioned you put the revolver in place to fund the acquisition. Can you just say how much you drew on it in the second quarter? Robert P. Ryder: No, I'm not going to give second quarter balance sheet stuff, right? So we did draw on it to fund the acquisition, which happened like 7 days into the quarter. Operator : That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks. Robert S. Sands: Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. We are very excited about the final completion of the beer deal. We have great marketplace momentum across beer, wine and spirits, and we're on track to meet all our goals for the year. I hope you've had the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars and Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So thanks, again, for your participation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis, however, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2014 sales and earnings results. The second quarter marks the first time that we are reporting consolidated results for Crown and our new Mexican brewery. And I'm pleased to report that the transition of our new beer business has been successful and seamless. Operations are running smoothly. There has been no disruptions to service or delays in shipment and our beer supply chain is operating efficiently. Most importantly, the Crown commercial business, which by the way had a great quarter, has not been impacted by the transition. Maintaining this high level of performance during the transition is a true testament to the talent and commitment of the Crown team and the Nava employees in Mexico. The Nava brewery is extremely important to us, and we're proud that it is now an integral part of Constellation. As you know, one of our top priorities is expanding the brewery. We've been fully immersed in the initial planning stages of the brewery expansion project, which includes the buildout of the brewhouse, packaging, warehousing and site infrastructure. We have already selected those companies that will support us in these key areas, strategically choosing the ones we believe to be the most experienced business partners. From a project management perspective, we are building the best team as it relates to engineering, supply chain, procurement, quality, finance, HR, legal and IT, doing our best to ensure that every aspect of the brewery integration and expansion will be successful. Closing the beer transaction has also been very important for our wholesalers. No one should underestimate the goodwill that has been created with our Crown distributor network with the assurance that Constellation will be their long-term business partner. As I mentioned, Crown has had a great quarter, generating sales growth of 3% while continuing to gain market share with depletion and underlying earnings growth of about 7%. All core Modelo brands posted notable depletion growth during the quarter with Modelo Especial up 17% and Corona Extra and Corona Light growing in the 4% to 5% range. Corona Extra has posted its best Corona summer since the inception of the Crown JV. The summer season success of Corona Extra was driven by a number of factors, including its well-executed summer retail promotion and TV advertising campaign called \"Live it, Share it, Win it,\" which resulted in increased features and displays at retail. In addition, Crown leveraged its Hispanic boxing sponsorship with limited edition Corona packaging featuring boxing legends and rising champions. The recently launched Corona Light draft is growing in every market where we have introduced this new format, which is also having a positive impact on the overall growth of the brand. Now during the second quarter, Modelo Especial launched its biggest summer promotion ever with its win a trip to Brazil program. This promotion was supported with new TV advertising in English and Spanish and dedicated TV support across FOX properties, as well as promotional packaging. Pacifico introduced its national digital media campaign as well as television advertising in key focus markets during the quarter. Initial results showed strong increases in awareness and trial resulting from these efforts. Pacifico continues to be the #1 draft brand in the Crown portfolio, posting a second quarter 34% depletion increase for this format. And during the quarter, Negra Modelo officially introduced the Chef Rick Bayless sponsorship, including TV advertising, impact offers and sampling opportunities, which collectively are contributing to the success of the brand in priority markets. Overall, we are well positioned to generate organic growth throughout the remainder of the year with the following plans for our portfolio of iconic brands. Corona Extra will have a strong support throughout the football season, including new TV ads featuring Jon Gruden. In addition, we will air new Spanish-language creative on TV while also featuring game day football promotions. Modelo Especial's Hispanic real world campaign will continue to air across national Spanish-language television. And while we're on the subject of Modelo Especial, Modelo Especial Chelada will roll out in key markets earlier this week and will be supported by national Hispanic TV advertising. We have plans for a national product rollout in time for next year's key summer selling season. I recently had the opportunity to sample the Chelada, and its refreshing taste is really great. I would encourage you to give it a try. The draft beer opportunity for the Crown portfolio continues to have significant momentum with draft depletions increasing nearly 40% during the second quarter. And finally, while Somersby cider has done well in initial test markets, Crown and Carlsberg have mutually agreed that Crown will no longer represent the Somersby brand in the U.S. At this time, we need to focus our efforts from a Crown perspective on growing our current portfolio of great brands in order to realize our long-term goals. Now, before we review the operational results for our wine and spirits business, I would like to take a moment to discuss the impairment charge that we have taken for our Canadian wine business. As part of our acquisition of the Vincor Canadian wine business in 2006, we purchased some strong leading brands, like Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin, that have been solid performers. Today, much of the market growth is coming from consumers' desire for innovation and new brands and from import wines, areas we have had some good success in the marketplace. Given these market trends, we have experienced declining performance in certain parts of our legacy business, including refreshments, wine kits and certain value wine brands. It is these areas that have contributed to the need to take the impairment charge. As a result going forward, we'll be focused on the following : sales of higher-value, higher-margin imports, including Mondavi, Crawford -- Kim Crawford and Ruffino; maintaining our focus on driving growth of our most important premium domestic wines, including Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek and Inniskillin; and innovation as we continue to create new brands and products that meet the evolving taste preferences of consumers. We believe this strategic evolution will generate the most profit for Constellation and positively position us for future growth and strengthened market leadership in Canada. Canada is a growing healthy market and continues to be a strategic important business for Constellation. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. As expected, the overall second quarter financial performance for wine and spirits was impacted by the timing of product shipments. We expect most of the growth for this business to be generated in the second half of the year, which aligns with our highest seasonal selling period for the year and a launch of most of our new product introductions. Second quarter segment net sales for wine increased 2%, driven by the U.S. wine portfolio. From a consumer takeaway perspective within IRI channels, our wine portfolio outperformed overall U.S. category growth during the quarter on a volume basis. And from a depletion perspective, our Focus Brands grew almost 3x the rate of our total portfolio, posting double-digit growth trends for Black Box, SIMI, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Nobilo. The year-over-year spirits sales decline for the quarter can be attributed to the timing of new product launches and product shipments for the year, as well as the unfavorable comparison versus last year when we had the benefit of some bulk spirits sales. There are no fundamental issues with the underlying health of the spirits business. As a matter of fact, from a consumer takeaway perspective, spirits increased about 4% across all channels during the quarter. We also recently launched the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which is priced at a premium versus our base Black Velvet brand. The cinnamon flavored category in whisky is currently on fire, experiencing triple-digit growth trends. Now as previously indicated, we are very excited about the second half rollout of our lineup of new wine brands and product extensions, including Rosatello, a sweet, low-alcohol wine that is targeted to Hispanic and urban female consumers; Milestone, focusing on the millennial consumer who is looking for a contemporary and aspirational offering; V.NO, a multivarietal wine that is positioned for millennials who like to travel and explorer; and Hidden Crush, an easy drinking, on-premise-only brand that is perfect by the glass pour for new drinkers; and SAVED, a new luxury priced brand that is the collaboration between tattoo artist to the stars, Scott Campbell, and our award-winning winemaker from Wild Horse, Clay Brock. Some of our successful new brands were recently honored by key industry publications including The Dreaming Tree, which received the prestigious distinction of Best New Wine Product by Market Watch and a top Hot Prospect by Impact. Primal Roots, Thorny Rose, Ruffino Prosecco and Dise\u00f1o joined The Dreaming Tree on the Hot Prospect list. During the second quarter, we also received several awards for some of our key Focus Brands including Kim Crawford, which has been recognized by Impact as a newcomer Blue Chip Brand. The Robert Mondavi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve received a 93 point rating from Robert Parker, along with the 2010 Ruffino Modus, which received a 90-plus point score. Our 2011 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Pinot Noir was rated 92 points and a best buy by Wine & Spirits Magazine. And the 2009 Simi Landslide Cabernet Sauvignon received a double gold medal at the 33rd Annual San Francisco International Wine Competition. And the Franciscan 2010 Merlot received a score of 90 points in Editor's Choice accolade in the September issue of the Wine Enthusiast. Now as is typical at this point of the year, I'd like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape harvest, which is currently underway and off to an early start with almost 65% complete in California. Growing conditions were very good in most regions and 2013 yields are expected to be consistent with last year's crop, subject to variation in each region. Quality is expected to be very good. Overall, grape pricing is expected to decline slightly compared to last year depending on variety, location and demand. In closing, we are working diligently on the brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of the Crown commercial business. And with our wine and spirits business, we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brands during the upcoming holiday seasons. I'm especially gratified by the fact that Constellation remains one of the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staple stocks this year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for our financial discussion of our second quarter results. Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $0.96. This represents a sizable increase versus Q2 last year as we begin to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our Q2 results also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. As a result, we are lowering our full year comparable basis tax rate estimate, which is driving an increase in our fiscal 2014 comparable basis EPS guidance. We'll now look closer at some of the highlights just mentioned as we review Q2 performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales in Q2 included $763 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales for all but 6 days of the second quarter. For the full second quarter, the beer segment generated net sales of $815 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year second quarter period. While depletions were strong at 7% for the quarter, Crown faced a tough sales comparison versus Q2 last year when net sales increased 8% as there were some wholesaler buy-in ahead of planned price increases in select markets in the fall of last year. Wine net sales increased 2% while spirits net sales decreased 18% due to the timing of shipments. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis decreased 1% as an increase in wine shipment volume was more than offset by higher promotion expense and a decrease in spirits volume. As a reminder from time-to-time, we will see fluctuations in growth transfer shipments, depletions and revenue on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to various factors, like the timing of new product introductions and promotional activities. We expect spirits sales trends to improve in the back half of the year as we just began the rollout of Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, and we look forward to see benefits from the restaging of our new packaging for the SVEDKA flavors. We also expect to see better wine sales performance in the back half of the year driven by the rollout of new products and improved mix from initiatives planned for our Focus Brands during the upcoming key holiday season. For the quarter, gross profits increased $302 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognize our share of Crown's earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction early in Q2, 100% of Crown's results along with the Mexican beer production profit stream are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $311 million. This produced a beer gross margin of 41% for the quarter based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 40.3% versus 41% for the prior year quarter. After factoring in the impact of consolidating the beer business, the remaining change in gross margin is primarily the result of higher promotion expense and grape cost for the wine business and lower spirits sales. Some of the higher promotional expense reflects a shift for marketing spending that we originally planned. SG&A for the quarter increased $91 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $89 million. So essentially, all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown as the brewery has very little cost classified as SG&A. Based on what I just outlined, the incremental operating income generated by the beer business was $221 million for the quarter. This result produced an operating margin of approximately 29%. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 400 basis point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $4 million versus $71 million in the prior year second quarter. The decrease was due to the consolidation of the beer business as of June 7. Interest expense for the quarter was $90 million, up 65% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of August, our total debt was $7.3 billion. This represents a $4 billion increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2013. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation during the first half of fiscal '14. We continue to expect interest expense for the year to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. As you may recall, we did not include any potential impact of the beer acquisition in our initial fiscal '14 effective tax rate guidance, as we were working to close the transaction and evaluating tax structures. During Q2, we recognized the tax effect of the structure related to the beer business. This structure complements the overseas debt we put in place as part of our transaction financing. Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 29%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business, as well as the favorable outcome of various tax items related to previous years. This compares to a 16% tax rate from the prior year second quarter, which included the benefit of higher foreign tax credits. Given the anticipated lower tax rate associated with our foreign beer profit streams, we now expect the comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 32% for fiscal 2014. We also expect the 32% rate to be a good target rate to assume for Constellation as the brewery gets built out over the next 3 years. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first half of fiscal '14, we generated $440 million of free cash flow versus $333 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to benefits from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments and lower cash flow results for the wine business. While we're quite pleased with the strong year-to-date free cash flow results, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $575 million as we expect some acquisition-related integration costs and our targeted brewery capital expansion investments to temper free cash flow results in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 P&L outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.10 a share. This represents a $0.20 increase versus our previous guidance and is being driven by the lower tax rate projection I outlined earlier. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Let's talk a bit about 2 significant noncomparable items that were recorded in the quarter. During Q2, we recognized a $1.6 billion noncash gain from the revaluation of our original 50% ownership interest in Crown to reflect the fair value as required by GAAP. This gain is nontaxable. Similar to Q2, we expect this accounting requirement to result in a very low reported effective tax rate for the year. As outlined by Rob earlier, we recorded a $301 million in noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge related to our Canadian business. In addition, we continue to expect onetime costs associated with the beer transaction and integration activities to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate how pleased we are to have completed the transformational beer business acquisition. Our Q2 results started to demonstrate how this transaction enhances our financial profile as it significantly increases our sales, operating profit and operating margin. The transition of Crown and the brewery has been positive as our beer supply chain has been operating efficiently and Crown's execution in the marketplace has been outstanding. For our wine and spirits business, our investments in innovation behind new brands and our key Focus Brands position us for strong marketplace execution during the key holiday season. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Two questions related to the beer business in the quarter. First, Bob, if you could just talk about, I guess, the cost structure in the quarter to the extent that this is the first quarter you've owned the business, vertically integrated and you're accruing for certain cost for the first time, things like security, I guess, and other sort of items. Just do you think that this quarter was reflective of kind of what you expect in terms of those overhead costs going forward this year? Or was there anything unusual about what you would have accrued or booked for expenses in the quarter? Robert P. Ryder: No, I'd say in general, as Rob said, the brewery transition, I'd say both operationally and financially, has gone very smoothly. I don't think -- well, I know we really haven't seen any surprises coming out of the financial statements or the manufacturing equipment. So no, I'd say it was a pretty smooth quarter. And I wouldn't expect any dramatic changes balance of the year. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. And then second question, just in terms of the depletions, beer depletions in the quarter, could you give us some color in terms of how much of that growth in the quarter was driven by new distribution versus just, I guess, velocity or growth off of your existing base? Just trying to get a sense for how much of the growth was just a greater lift because you ran summer promotions this year, which you don't normally do, and how much of it was just truly from new distribution gains? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, good question, Bryan. It was actually -- everything went well this quarter. So Corona actually experienced some of the best growth -- brand Corona, some of the best growth that we've seen since the JV was formed. And as you know, Corona is pretty much fully distributed. There's probably some opportunities on cans. But it's pretty much everywhere you'd want to be. So you'd call that probably like per cap consumption growth for Corona. In addition to that, Modelo Especial continues to grow rather well. And Modelo Especial is not nearly as well distributed as Corona. So I'd say a lot of the Especial growth is from expanded distribution. But we see per cap consumption in Especial as well. So I'd say it was a combination of all of the above. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Davidson. Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Just another follow-up on beer. Margins there might have been a little less than what I was working within my model and perhaps less than what you had pro forma-ed for 2012. I know that's probably where Bryan was going with his question. But can you shed any light on that, where we should be thinking about that? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think the margins were pretty much where we expected, Tim. We had a gross margin in the low 40% range. That's probably kind of the neighborhood we expect until Nava gets up and operating and we save some freight and start producing the beer in a more efficient facility. So I'd say margins were pretty much what we expected. Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay, sounds good. And in wine, the impact of the harvest really, I guess, won't be felt for another 12 months at least. But can you describe kind of what you see in the tone of the market right now? It seems like it's fairly strong, but I'd love to hear your sort of tone of market comments. Robert S. Sands: Yes. This is Rob, Tim. I think that over the shorter term, wine consumption or the market has been perhaps a little weaker than we anticipated, sort of in the low single-digits, maybe growing around 2% or so. I think that, that's really being driven largely by the lower end of the market. So value wines, where a lot of pricing has been taken in the marketplace, I think that -- and everything overvalue, premium plus where we play, we continue to see sort of flat pricing, i.e. no pricing, to perhaps a little bit on the upside or some slightly decreased promo. I think consumer takeaway and premium plus continues to be strong certainly in super premium, ultra premium, luxury, et cetera. We still see very strong consumer takeaway, I would say that relative to the harvest, it's going to be another relatively large harvest, 2 large harvests in a row. Sort of the grape undersupply was greatly overstated. If you can put that all together, meaning there isn't much of a grape undersupply, in fact, we see in general bulk wine inventories have rebounded, are pretty strong right now. Prices for grapes have been coming down for the last couple of years ever since the perceived short harvest of, I think, 3 years ago sort of disproportionately affected that harvest because people got a little hysterical over it. And so in general, I would say that we see nothing in the wine business that is really unusual. I think even the slight weakness in consumer takeaway is really nothing odd. I think it's really, as I said, mostly a function of some significant pricing that was taken in basically 5-liter bag-in-the-box and jug wines. So I think it's a little artificial. So that's basically what I would say is the tone of the wine business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So a couple of questions from my end. First, Bob, just in terms of your guidance, I know you've raised the full year EPS guidance on lower tax rate. But I don't think you gave any update on kind of how you see the wine and the beer businesses unfolding from both top and bottom line perspective. And beer top line clearly seems like it's accelerated a bit more in the second quarter. So just if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about both line items from a guidance perspective for the full year. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, sure. You're right, Judy. The only guidance we changed was for the tax rate. Other than that, I'd say year-to-date, I'd say again you're right. I think beer is probably a little better than we anticipated and wine might be a little bit worse than we anticipated. But we don't think that those changes were material enough to change our guidance, balance of year. So we'll be reassessing it and update everybody on the January call. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And on the beer side, so I think beginning of the year, you talked about brewery profit being down with some inflation, but Crown's side of the business being up in profit. Does that sort of guidance still kind of hold and you'll reassess how sales kind of play out for the balance of the year? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think that's fair. Yes, nothing has changed materially around that. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just on the beer pricing environment, we know that you've announced select price increases in some of the markets. If you could just give a little bit more clarity around kind of the magnitude and your sense of how well those price increases are sticking in the marketplace. We've also been hearing some chatter about price increases by the major guys being rescinded in some of the markets. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any of that kind of playing out in your major markets. Robert S. Sands: Yes, Judy. In general, I would say that our pricing strategy has not changed at all. Yes, we announced some pricing, and we fully expect that pricing to stick. Our process is really to look at pricing market-by-market strategically and, of course, we watch the price gaps very closely. But obviously, our business is very, very strong. So we don't anticipate any change in our pricing strategy at all relative to what anybody else is doing, so... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : A couple of questions. One is just more detail on the second quarter wine performance in the U.S. I think you said your depletions for wine in volume terms were up 2%, but you increased promotional activity. So in value terms, how did your wine do in terms of depletion and then also at retail? That's the first question. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say in value terms, it was probably flattish for the quarter. Remember that wine was overlapping a real peak period last year, where we really were gaining a lot of market share and saw some pretty good top line results. So it was a difficult overlap for the quarter for wine. And we talked about in the spirits business, which is caught up with wine and spirits and those numbers, we also had some odd overlaps year-over-year. And we expect the business for both wine and spirits to pick up quite a bit in Q3 and Q4. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Do you think the promotional activity in wine will lessen in your second half? Robert P. Ryder: It will lessen a little bit. But remember, because the second half has Christmas, and Christmas is a much richer mix of the higher-priced the product that drags more higher promotion spending to it. But yes, I would expect promotion spending to abate in the back half. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : At least in the comps. Robert P. Ryder: Correct. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Right, okay. And then my other question is an update on the guidance you've given us for beer margins between now and fiscal '17. I think you said that you aspire to get to the low to mid-30s, but that's a pretty big range from 32% to 36%, I guess. And can you tell us if you're more comfortable in the middle of that range or the low end or the high end? Robert P. Ryder: Well, I'd say it's not really a statistically valid sample at this point because we only had 1 quarter out of a 3-year thing. But there's nothing that we've seen in the beer business that would tell us that we're off materially from those estimates. As we said, the things that are going to drive the big improvement in margins is moving more production to the Nava facility, which is, number one, more efficient than the older breweries from which we're buying the product from InBev now. And in addition, we'll be saving quite a bit of freight because the Nava brewery is closer to its end consumer. They are the 2 big drivers. And nothing we've learned has told us that, that won't be true when the brewery gets built out. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I guess, to be more blunt about it, I think most of us are assuming you'll get nearer the upper end of that guidance for beer margins by the '15 -- fiscal '16 and '17 period rather than the low end. And are we all being overly optimistic? Robert P. Ryder: I would never accuse you of being overly optimistic. But as we look at our data, you're looking at your own data, we don't have enough visibility that far out to kind of put a more aggressive plank in the stand. So we still think the numbers that we've come out with are the best we have. And remember, we're all trying to extrapolate from benchmarks. And the Crown business is a very unique business coming out of one site south of the border, yet distributing throughout the United States higher price points. So it's difficult to get a benchmark with a similar kind of business in the U.S. But I know you guys will keep trying. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : On the beer trends, can you just maybe give us an update? I mean, certainly Modelo has done a phenomenal job today, but where we are in terms of ACV if that's the right way to look at it and when Modelo Light will start to -- when we would see that and what inning you think this whole rollout is. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say on Modelo Especial, distribution of Modelo Especial is probably 30% to 40% less than distribution on Corona, right? And we firmly believe that Modelo Especial is the next Corona. So we still think there's considerable upside both from bottles and cans and draft. We're also extremely underpenetrated in the draft industry. Generally speaking, draft comprises about 10% of the domestic guys' sales. It's less than 2% for us. So we think there's a lot of opportunity, and Modelo Especial on draft is fantastic. So we're probably in the third or fourth inning on Especial. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And Modelo Light, any update there? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Modelo Light is being tested in one market. And we're still tweaking the product to better align with consumers' desires, mostly right now around the bottle and the label. We think the beer itself is very good, but we're trying to get the package right. So we're still kind of, I'd say, tinkering with it. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just switching back to the comments on both the discontinued distribution of the cider and the changes in Canada, does that have a meaningful impact? Or can you kind of quantify the impact on sales going forward? Robert P. Ryder: No, I mean, the cider was tiny. And the impairment charge has no impact on how you operate the business. It's kind of a theoretical Excel model calculation that, for us, resulted in a noncash charge and has no impact on how we run the business. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : So you've already been doing that in Canada, it's just the final charge to follow that up in terms of focus? Robert P. Ryder: Correct. Right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC. Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division : Just a follow-up on beer and one on wine also. On beer, I understand you're not ready or you don't want to reveal your pricing strategy. But when you mentioned the fact that pricing is sticking, just curious, is this something that you took earlier this year? It wasn't for the summer selling season, I assume. And with that said, now that the summer is over, do you think seeing what your competitors are doing, there is more room for pricing for the next quarter or 2? Robert S. Sands: First of all, our pricing and pricing in the beer industry is typically taken right about now, right, October-ish. And as is publicly known, we sent out letters to our distributors with regard to our pricing. Generally, it's not that we're not revealing our pricing strategy. We've taken some pricing. We're focused on gaps. And we fully expect that we'll achieve the pricing that we've expected throughout the year. Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division : So there is potential now that we're in October... Robert S. Sands: We're not going to -- typically, pricing is largely taken once a year in beer. That's the answer to your question. Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And if I could ask on wine also with respect to the impairment charge, we've seen some similar charges for some of your other brands, particularly within the value segment. So just curious to get the skew now of value versus premium, if there's the risk of more of these types of charges coming through, where we're kind of at the end of running the risk of more of these impairment charges. Robert S. Sands: Yes, it has nothing to do with value versus premium. We don't take charges against specific brands. It's against the acquired business in Canada. And no, we don't expect to take any further impairment charges. And as I said, it's really related to our strategy in Canada. And it's about the fact that we have focused on parts of the business, which were not acquired, such as imports, which constitute 70% of the market and are a much higher gross profit margin than our domestic business, and therefore, don't really factor in as materially into the impairment charge versus some of our legacy business, which has been declining and we always anticipated would decline, such as kits, refreshments and some of the value part of the business, which were strategically haven't been focused on -- never been focused on. And basically, since the acquisition in 2006, as you know, we're only focused on our premium businesses in general. So it's really no surprise and not indicative in any way of how the Canadian business is, in fact, performing. It's an accounting artifice, in my opinion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions also on Crown. One is it seems like there's been a favorable disconnect between retail transfer, your portfolio and depletion rates. And of course, we're looking at scanner data that's not capturing channels you're actually selling in. So is that a fair characterization? That's question one. And then question two, on the brand specifically of Corona, can you remind us of how it's structured in terms of seasonality? Summer, I think, remains the most important period. But it's because you've had success expanding the brand in other parts of the year, just give us some flavor for how that seasonality looks and what your plans are to try to sustain the lift in trend for that brand you saw over the summer. Robert S. Sands: Yes. Mark, in terms of depletions and IRI, there's really not a disconnect. The IRI only constitutes about, I don't know, a little bit less than 50% of the market. It doesn't include the on-premise. The on-premise has been relatively weak in general across all alcoholic beverages. It's about 20% of the beer business. So that's one of the factors. And then I would say that it's really timing. I'd say that, in general, if you really look at it kind of channel-by-channel and figure out the waiting, there is not a disconnect between depletions and IRI. As to shipments, there is a bit of a disconnect, but that's a very -- it's a short-term issue and strictly related to timing of shipments, which you basically can't look at timing of shipments on a month-by-month basis, in that we can have different -- there can be different impacts on inventories and buy-ins and things to that effect in very short periods of time, say, September versus August. So we fully expect the normal taste to occur, which is that shipments and depletions will be equal for the year. So you shouldn't count on anything weird there either. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Fair enough. And Corona? Robert S. Sands: What was your question on Corona? Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Well, it's still a comparatively high volume in the summer season. But can you give us the sense of how it mapped out by the year and what your intentions are for sustaining the improvement we saw over the summer? Robert P. Ryder: I'd say -- Mark, this is Bob. The beer business obviously is a summer business. But Christmas period is one of the higher periods for Corona because people tend to get better-quality products for their holiday parties, which tends to suit us. So we've had tremendous momentum in the summer. I wouldn't expect that to continue balance of year. But we think that the marketing that's in the marketplace right now, especially the beer cooler promotion has been incredibly powerful. We plan on rerunning the Feliz Navidad commercial at Christmas, which just year-after-year people just really love. And so we're expecting a pretty good balance of year. You'll be seeing, as Rob said, some Jon Gruden commercials. We'll be advertising with the NFL and with the NBA when they start out, right? But I wouldn't expect the current momentum to continue. It'll probably slow down a little bit, and it's -- I'll say it's in more off-season than the summer. Of course, our peak season starts with Cinco, right? We start a little bit earlier than everybody else and goes right through Labor Day, and then we cool down a little bit and then picks up again at Christmas. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And can you -- that's very helpful. Can you comment rate of depletion growth in the month of September, what kind of trends you saw? Robert P. Ryder: No. September, again what we see in September, right, remember we had some distributor unloading at the end of the quarter in August. So they'll start to replenish those inventories as they go into the fall season. Robert S. Sands: September also had 1 extra selling day. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Got it. Okay. One final question if I... Robert S. Sands: So the depletions will be looking good in September. You'd adjust that back by 5% right there. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Sure. One final one if I could. On wine, nice trend we've seen continuing here, the Focus Brands do better than the non-Focus Brands. But of course, that gap implies your non-Focus Brands are declining. You talked a little bit about that. Can you talk a little bit more about why the non-Focus Brands are declining at the rate they are? And when you might actually get to a point, where these non-Focus Brands are getting to just a scale level where the rate of decline is more likely to moderate? Robert S. Sands: Well, I mean, I think that every large wine business has Focus Brands and non-Focus Brands, as well as the spirits companies have Focus Brands and non-Focus Brands as well. No, they're not going to get to a level where they become so marginalized that they don't make a significant contribution to the business. It's all about sort of balancing, I'll say, how you're utilizing your cash flows and your profits from their non-Focus Brands against building the business and creating growth in your Focus Brand portfolio. So yes, just sort of a normal business state for most of the large beverage alcohol companies actually across all 3 segments is that how we balance that. Crown is the unusual animal in that regard, right, because the Crown business is 100% Focus Brand. It's only got 8 brands in total, all growing, all Focus Brands. So that's very unusual, I mean, compared to anybody else. Basically in the whole beverage alcohol business, the big brewers all have big portfolios as you're well aware of. I'll call them non-Focus Brands or sub premiums, value-type products that they're employing the same kind of strategy against it. I just talked about spirits companies and for that matter, the 2 or 3 other large wine companies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with ISI. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : A couple of things. Can you give us an update on your latest thinking in terms of, I don't know, quarter maybe or half year of when you'll be ready to start producing more volume at Piedras Negras? Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Robert, I think what we said was it's 3 years out, right, because the brewery now has 10 million hectoliter capacity. We plan to get it up to 20 million. But that's going to take about 3 years, and it's all going to kind of happen at once. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And in terms of timing there, obviously no change in that right now? Robert P. Ryder: No change in that, no. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Second, and I know we've talked about it a lot and I know -- I understand the basic idea between the difference between shipments and depletions and timing differences. But this difference was a pretty big one. And I know last year, you mentioned that 200 to 400 basis points of your shipments last year were pulled in from the third quarter as distributors did a big buy-in ahead of price increases last year. I'm just -- I'm still a little bit puzzled. I mean, you're doing a price increase again this year, why there would be that big a difference and why there wouldn't be the same sort of pull on this year, so you wouldn't have that kind of a difference between shipments and depletions. Robert P. Ryder: Yes. This year, it's a little later, that's all. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So the price increase was later? Robert S. Sands: So it's not a second quarter, you'll see it more in the third quarter. Robert P. Ryder: The other thing, Robert, is last year, the price increase was really the first Crown had taken in 5 years. So I think there was a bit of newness to it. I think this year, there's -- people are a little bit more practiced at it. Robert S. Sands: But you'll see it all straighten itself out over the second quarter. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : No, I understand that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the pattern. And did you... Robert S. Sands: It's a little later, that's the point. And there was also some other, I'll say, fluctuations in our purchases and our shipments last year that are different than this year. But again it's going to straighten itself out, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. You can't get too focused on it. It's something that was going to be strange from the year -- on a year -- throughout the year, I mean, we'd tell you, but there's nothing going on. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. So the price increase this year was just maybe a couple of weeks later? Robert S. Sands: It wasn't later, but the buy-in was a little later. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then in terms -- as you look at the Modelo brands that you can now bring into the U.S., any new thoughts in terms of particular brands? I think there was Leon and a couple of other ones that looked promising. And also just wanted you to comment, the big guys, there's this trend to increase ABV. It would be my guess that you really can't change the ABV of any of your existing brands that are part of the Modelo portfolio. Can you confirm that? And are there any other opportunities for you to introduce brands with higher ABV? Robert S. Sands: First of all, we can make formula changes to our brands, but we have no intention at the current time of changing the ABV of any of our brands, not because we can't, but because we don't desire to. If you see what's going on with ABV, it's largely new products that are being introduced at a higher ABV; it's not that existing products are changing their ABV. So we wouldn't do that. And we'd be -- as far as new products or line extensions that we might consider some time for the future, different style of products that may or may not have a higher ABV, will certainly be on the table to look at, so... Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So let me just -- just so I get this right, you would be allowed to come out with a Corona XX at a 6% if you wanted to? Robert P. Ryder: Absolutely. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup. Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I wanted to circle back, Rob, on your comment about bulk wine in the U.S. Given how much more bulk wine there is this year versus last, as you think about the pricing that you've been seeing in the value wine segment, does that put that pricing at risk, and then in turn put more pressure on your premium business? Robert S. Sands: I don't think so. Value wines, you're talking about 2 producers, right, that produce most of the 5-liter bag-in-the-box, Gallo and The Wine Group. I mean, I don't think they're being highly influenced by the bulk wine market necessarily. It's probably fundamentally a nonstrategic business for them. But I don't know. And in terms of pricing in general in the wine market, I would say that the fact that supply is not as tight as it's been is interesting, but we don't -- just like the perceived tighter supply and the higher cost of goods sold from a few harvests ago didn't make much of a difference in pricing, I don't think it's going to make much of a difference in pricing going forward in premium plus either. You don't see wine pricing at retail fluctuate with perceived over or undersupply pretty much period in premium plus. Operator : That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks. Robert S. Sands: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. And needless to say, we are very excited about the fact that we've completed the consolidation of our new brewery in Mexico with our Crown commercial business. And I'm also very proud to have the team as an integral part of Constellation. We have very strong momentum for our beer business as we head into the second half of the year and our wine and spirits business is well positioned for a great holiday selling season. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. So thanks again, everyone, for your participation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. Welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning and happy New Year to everyone. I hope everybody enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to drink some of our Constellation products this holiday season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2014 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that for a second consecutive year, Constellation stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples universe, as well as one of the top performing stocks within the overall S&P 500 index, increasing almost 100% for calendar year 2013. We believe that the realization of significant benefits from the beer business acquisition, along with excellent execution within Crown's U.S. commercial business, are the key driver of this stock price appreciation. In addition, we have successfully completed the transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. Beer operations are running smoothly, the supply chain is operating efficiently, and all key performance metrics are being achieved at the brewery. As you know, we are in the initial phase of the brewery expansion project which will include the buildout of the brewhouse, packaging, warehousing and site infrastructure. Although we are in the early stages of this process, I am pleased to report that all design work for the brewery and the packaging area has been completed, and we are currently finalizing warehouse expansion details. In addition, stainless steel is being fabricated for the beer tanks, and we have begun grading of the site in preparation for the building construction. From a commercial beer business perspective in the U.S., Crown had a phenomenal quarter, generating sales growth of 21% while continuing to gain market share. All 4 Mexican brands posted notable depletion growth during the quarter, with their 2 most significant brands, Modelo Especial increasing 18% and Corona Extra growing almost 6%. Depletions for the draft beer business increased more than 30%, and after repositioning Victoria in key markets and expanding into select new markets, this brand has regained momentum, posting depletion growth of greater than 20%. Overall, excellent sales and depletion results for Crown were driven by a number of factors, including continuing strong consumer demand for our outstanding portfolio of brands; an increase in third quarter shipments to replenish distributor inventory levels which were running below normal after this year's robust summer selling season; an easier comparison versus last year's third quarter due to the timing of shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 in advance of price increases in select markets; and excellent execution by Crown wholesalers who now have the assurance that Constellation will be their long-term business partner since the closing of the beer deal. The renewed momentum we experienced during the summer selling season, particularly for the Corona brand, continued throughout the fall and into the holiday selling season. We believe this strong consumer demand was driven by the combined success of a number of marketing initiatives, including execution of the new TV advertising, including the Some Beaches campaign, Jon Gruden TV ads featured during Monday Night Football games, and new Spanish-language creative which was aired on TV during Mexican national team soccer matches and other key programs on Spanish-language networks. Corona also sponsored the Mayweather versus Canelo boxing fight, supported by TV advertising and limited edition 18-pack wrapped bottles which resulted in strong execution in Hispanic accounts. Corona Extra has now become the fifth-largest dollar-share brand in IRI channels, and continues to grow and gain share. The strong momentum of Modelo Especial also continued throughout the quarter. New SKU and innovation including Modelo Especial Chelada are driving consumer trade-up within the overall portfolio and bringing new customers into the franchise. New Spanish-language TV advertising was recently introduced to support the newly released Modelo Especial Chelada, which has significantly exceeded volume and distribution targets in its launch markets. Modelo Especial draft, Crown's second-largest draft brand after Pacifico, grew 30% -- 35% during the quarter. Overall, the strong results that Crown has achieved this year are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2014. As such, we are also revising our fiscal 2014 forecast for the Crown business and now expect beer depletions to increase mid single-digits, which will drive sales growth in the high single-digit range with operating profits expected to increase in the low- to mid-teen range. And now, I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. As we noted earlier this year, the performance of our wine and spirits business would be skewed towards the second half of the year to align with peak -- the peak seasonality of the business as well as new product introductions. I'm very encouraged by the acceleration of depletion trends during the third quarter and the fact that on a year-to-date basis, we are outperforming the U.S. wine market on a volume basis across all channels. These results were driven by some of our key Focus Brands that continue to achieve noteworthy accomplishments, a few of which I will highlight. The 2011 Robert Mondavi Oakville Fum\u00e9 Blanc was recently awarded a 95-point score in the Top 100 Wine for 2013 from Wine Enthusiast. The 2010 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Reserve received 95 points from Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, who also liked the Franciscan 2010 Magnificat, which was awarded a 91-point score. Wine.com, the nation's #1 among retail, recently released its top 100 list based entirely on consumer preferences. Some of the great Constellation Brands that made the list include Robert Mondavi Napa Cabernet, Ruffino Modus, Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon. Impact recently presented Blue Chip Awards for Estancia, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, SVEDKA, Ruffino and Kim Crawford. And Constellation received 37 medals across all brands submitted to the 2013 World Value Wine Challenge, the nation's most comprehensive competition of wines priced at less than $20. Gold medals, 90-plus point scores and best buy distinctions were awarded to Robert Mondavi Private Selection, as well as Rex Goliath. Overall, third quarter segment net sales for wine increased 3% driven by the U.S. wine portfolio, with depletion trends for the entire portfolio growing more than 4%. Third quarter spirits sales declined 5% and can be primarily attributed to an unfavorable comparison versus last year when we had the benefit of the bulk bourbon sales. However, we experienced improving spirits depletion trends in the third quarter, as some of our investments took hold for this business. As a matter of fact, from a consumer takeaway perspective across all channels during the third quarter, Constellation's overall spirit growth of more than 5% exceeded the category growth of about 1.5%. SVEDKA depletions grew in the high single-digit range during the third quarter, while gaining almost 2 points of volume share of the imported vodka category in IRI channels. We are currently preparing to introduce the next 2 new SVEDKA flavors, strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple, which are expected to launch during the first quarter. The new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which launched early in the third quarter, is performing well and is one of our top-performing new SKUs from a distribution perspective. Since the closing of the beer deal, we have also begun to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer, wine and spirits business. For instance, SVEDKA and Corona joined forces for a national, on-premise program showcasing the SVEDKA Coronation Cocktail. This delicious proprietary beer cocktail harnesses the popularity of these 2 key brands and leverages the joint on-premise efforts of our organization. Corona Extra and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, recently partnered with Butterball, in a major cross-portfolio program that leveraged the power of the 2 strongest brands in our portfolio. This fully integrated holiday promotion began in advance of Thanksgiving, reaching consumers through displays, point-of-sale materials and a unique Turkey Talk-Line, where consumers received recipes and pairing tests. Now despite this quarter's improving depletion results for wine and spirits, we will be unable to attain our original fiscal 2014 operating profit goal for this business due to the following factors : the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium-priced products are growing faster than our super and ultra premium-priced products; and we have invested more than originally anticipated in promotional activity as the key to $5 to $15 price point at retail remains competitive. While we are disappointed that the wine and spirits business will not achieve its expected profitability goals, the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned this business heading into next year. Overall, our wine and spirits strategy has been to focus on brand-building and maintaining market share to ensure that our business remains strong and healthy. Strong competition for some of our key brands has necessitated higher promotional spend to meet this objective. We expect this strategy to reap rewards in the future when market dynamics begin to enable lower levels of promotional activity or more favorable pricing environment, as our brands will be in a great position to capitalize on these trends. Meanwhile, our focus on new product development and innovation, as well as channel development and execution to continue to contribute to our future growth while we remain committed to brand-building in our core business, we believe these initiatives will drive enhanced mixed results while we also expect to begin to realize benefits from abating grape costs. Collectively, these actions are expected to drive EBIT growth of the wine and spirits business in the future. In closing, as a true triple threat in beer, wine and spirits, we have ushered in an exciting new era of growth and opportunity. We are progressing with the brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of Crown's U.S. commercial business. We have a great premium wine business and plans in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stock in calendar 2013 for the consecutive year in a row. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results. Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.10. This represents a sizable increase versus Q3 last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our Q3 results also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate, driven by higher-than-expected foreign tax credits. The strong marketplace momentum we experienced over the summer for our beer business continued into the fall timeframe. Business helped to drive year-to-date financial performance ahead of our expectations and is the primary driver for the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 EPS guidance. Favorability in our tax rate and interest expense expectations are also contributing to our improved EPS guidance. The positive guidance factors that I just noted are being somewhat offset by our wine and spirits business. Our fiscal 2014 financial performance is expected to come in below our original expectations, as Rob just noted. We'll look closer at the guidance highlights just mentioned as we review Q3 performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales in Q3 included $662 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales for Q3. For Q3, beer segment net sales increased 21%, primarily due to volume growth as highlighted by Rob. These results are somewhat enhanced by an easier-than-normal sales comparison versus Q3 last year when net sales increased 1%. Depletions were strong at 10% growth for the quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This reflects a 4% increase in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, partially offset by higher promotion expense and lower bulk spirits sales. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $298 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognize our share of Crown's earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction on June 7, 100% of Crown's results, along with the Mexican beer production profit stream, are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $301 million in Q3. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 45% for the quarter based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 42.4% versus 41% for the prior year quarter. The benefit from the consolidation of the beer business was partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, which resulted from increased product costs and higher promotional spending. SG&A for the quarter increased $96 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $88 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown, as the brewery had very little costs classified as SG&A. Based on what I just outlined, operating income generated by the beer business was $213 million for the quarter. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 32%. Since the close of the acquisition on June 7, the consolidation of the beer business results has produced a beer operating margin of approximately 30%. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 350 basis-point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Due to the timing of the close of the beer acquisition, we did not recognize any equity earnings for Crown during the third quarter. For the prior year third quarter, equity earnings for Crown was $39 million. Equity earnings for the wine and spirits segment increased $4 million in Q3 of this year due to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the quarter was $90 million, up 46% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rate. We now expect interest expense for the year to approximate $325 million, which puts us at the low end of our previous $325 million to $335 million guidance range. Timing of our cash flow generation and benefit from our lower cost securitization facilities helped drive this improvement. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.1 billion. This represents a $3.8 billion increase of our debt level at the end of fiscal '13. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. During the third quarter, our debt balance decreased by $166 million. I would also like to note that the calculation of the post-closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction has been finalized, and we expect to make a payment of $558 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. In connection with this, the calendar 2012 EBITDA related to the acquired manufacturing and brand-owner profits came in a little above the $370 million we had originally estimated. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 28%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business as well as higher-than-anticipated foreign tax credits. Given the additional foreign tax credits, we now expect the comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 31% for fiscal 2014 versus our previous 32% guidance. Longer term, we continue to target a 32% effective tax rate as the brewery gets built out over the next 3 years. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '14, we generated $543 million of free cash flow versus $337 million for the same quarter last year -- the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to benefits from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. We're pleased with the strong year-to-date free cash flow results, but we expect brewery capital expansion investments to significantly increase in the fourth quarter. We have updated our free cash flow guidance to reflect the improvement in our projected beer business results and now expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This puts us at the higher end of our previous guidance range. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 P&L outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share, versus our previous guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 a share. Strong beer business performance is driving the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 guidance. For fiscal '14, Crown is now targeting net sales growth in the high single-digits, generally in line with what Crown has experienced on a year-to-date basis. We now expect underlying operating for Crown, which is before any beer manufacturing and brand-owner profit, to be in the low- to mid-teen range. Our brewery and brand-owner profits are also expected to exceed original expectations. Higher production volumes, favorable peso to dollar exchange rates and lower-than-anticipated SG&A build are driving this favorability. As mentioned earlier, wine and spirits performance has tracked below our original targets. We now expect wine and spirits organic revenue growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. The decrease versus our original mid single-digit target is being primarily driven by higher-than-planned promotional spending and lower-than-expected sales mix benefits. These factors are also driving a reduction in our wine and spirits operating income expectations. We now expect wine and spirits operating income to be flat to down slightly from the fiscal 2014 results. This is versus our original low to mid single-digit growth projection. The EPS guidance improvement also includes tax rate and interest rate favorability that I highlighted earlier. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. Before we take your questions, I would like to emphasize how pleased we are with the transformational beer business acquisition. Our results continue to demonstrate how this transaction enhances our financial profile, as it significantly increases sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our beer supply chain has been operating efficiently and Crown's execution and momentum in the marketplace has been outstanding, driving the upward revision in our EPS goal and positioning us well as we head towards the completion of a phenomenal year for Constellation. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Davidson. Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Let's see, the wine business did underperform a bit, but you made some comments that are sort of were in line with my bigger-picture thinking, which is that promotional spending will go down and pricing will go up in relationship to the tighter overall supply. The '13 crop was big, but longer term, I think that that thesis is correct. Can you comment at all on that? Robert S. Sands: Yes, I would say that we agree with that thesis. It depends, of course, what segments that you're talking about historically, or at least in the last 12 months. We have seen sort of the $5 to $15 segment be fairly competitive, which in our view, necessitated some additional investment in promo this year because our principal goal and strategy is really all about brand-building and making sure that we keep our portfolio healthy, precisely so that we can take advantage of the kind of trends that you were talking about. So we feel pretty good about that thesis, and layered on to our strategy is a pretty robust new product development process of initiatives also designed to continue to enhance our mix and our margins and ROIC as well. So we think that's sort of the combination of the expectation of an improving environment, combined with NPD intended to, as I said, drive mix and margins, is a pretty good formula for success in the future. Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : And if I could just follow up, one on the beer side, I think you said Corona's depletions were like 6%. Would that be indicative of kind of the pre-innovation number in the beer business? Should we kind of be thinking that baseline business was up 5 or 6, and innovation drove it higher to the 10-ish level? Robert S. Sands: Well, I wouldn't really call that baseline performance per se. We've been inclusive of the NPD. I mean, that is very, very strong performance. We probably say that for the longer term, it's fair to count on or to expect more like mid single-digit growth in total over the longer run. But clearly, we're significantly outperforming that due to very strong consumer takeaways. So it is a little hard to predict right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I have a little housekeeping question and then another one. In terms of your beer shipments, you had 4% price mix. I'm wondering if it's reasonable to think that at the level of shipping to the retailers, there was also 4% price mix on top of the 10% volume growth for beer? And then, can you take apart the 4%? How much of it was price and how much mix? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Alice, what I would say is there might have been some anomalies year-over-year in the quarter, but our price mix in beer is consistent with what we've been talking about all year, and that's probably right around 2%, is where we'll kind of end up at the end of the year, similar to last year's. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. That's helpful. And that was all price, right, because mix is maybe even a little negative? Robert P. Ryder: It was mostly price, yes. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Yes, and then my other question is a longer one. Your -- the only guidance you've given for where beer margins ultimately could go is, I think you said the low- to the mid-30s by fiscal '17. That's starting to look a little conservative. Can you comment on that? Where you think beer margins ultimately can go for you now that you know more about the business? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so again, this quarter, it was a fantastic quarter, so I'd be careful extrapolating that into the future. But we, right now, have no reason to change that beer operating or gross profit margin guidance. And remember, we're still new to the manufacturing of this, and as we build out the brewery and double the capacity, there's still some unknowns on what would happen. We were fortunate this year also that the peso-dollar exchange rate turned out to be much better than it was when we originally set guidance. So we're still sticking with that beer operating profit margin guidance. And as we learn more, because remember, a big piece of our finished goods is now produced by ourselves and we have less than perfect visibility into the cost structures of those when we take that over. So there's still a bit of grayness in there. So we're sticking with that guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : This is Sarah Miller, on for Bill. One of our questions is on -- do you have any visibility into what your timing of marketing is going to be, I guess for the -- over the balance of the next year for the beer business? Robert P. Ryder: Did you say -- well, I mean this year, I think we made a concerted effort to really take advantage of the peak summer sale seasons. And we kind of moved some of our marketing activities to that period of time. I think we're very happy with that result. So -- and actually at this time of year is when we're really kind of nailing down next year's plan, so it's not completely formulated yet. But I think we're pretty happy with this year's result, so there could be good probability that we replicate this year's timing of marketing spend. Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then second question on -- can you talk about kind of the status of the draft opportunity at this point? I know you mentioned that Modelo draft was up 35% in the quarter. Where is Corona Light, and kind of where are you seeing that success there? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so total -- we're very happy with our draft business. And in addition, as we get into new accounts with draft, we do see some evidence that helps our case sales as well. It's a very good marketing point to have those tap handles in front of the consumers as they are enjoying our products on-premise. But this year, total draft is growing about 30%, and actually, our largest draft product is Pacifico, but I think we're expecting great things from Corona Light draft, which we were in test market last year and we're rolling that out nationally as we go forward. So we probably expect Corona Light to be our biggest draft brand, followed by Pacifico, and then I think Modelo Especial is closely behind that. But we see great things for our draft business. Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And Corona Light starts to rollout now or next month? Or... Robert P. Ryder: It's rolling out as we speak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Two questions. One on beer and then over on to wine and spirits. On the beer side, kind of following on the last question, can you give us a little more color on what in your opinion is really driving this improvement in the Corona trend, the acceleration there? And similarly, what's driving the accelerating trends for Especial? Robert S. Sands: I think on -- there's a number of things going on here at a number of different levels. First of all, it's a little bit of success brings more success, especially with our wholesale customers who now I would say have the assurance that they're going to continue to retain these brands as they're going to be partnered with Constellation. As you can well imagine, the rest of the beer business, which constitutes very large portions of their business, is pretty lackluster and down. So -- and our wholesalers are really looking at our business as being the only material business that they have, which is really driving growth and profitability for them for the future. So I would say that they've really gotten behind it in a big way, which from a push perspective, is really driving the continued expansion of the brands at retail. And with the consumer, I'd say number two, our marketing of these brands has been very strong. Our investment behind these brands has been strong. And really, we're seeing sort of better brand health for these brands than we've ever seen in their history. And I think that that's translating to improved and better consumer takeaway. And something that I said in the past that I think differentiates us from a lot of the competition in beer is that we've had a very consistent message to the consumer about what these products stand for, year in and year out, that has resonated with the consumer. And I think that, as I said, that's a differentiating factor versus the competition, which has kind of been all over the place trying to find some hook with the consumer in a market that's been down overall. So look, the better beer market is the place to be. We're the largest player in the better beer market. The consumer is definitely also trading up in beer to more premium products, and we're reaping the rewards of all of these trends as well as our own good marketing and sales execution, and as well as having a very strong distribution network behind our brands in a way like they probably have never gotten behind any brands in the past. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : That's great. And if I could, on that topic, before we go over to wine and spirits, when you look at Especial specifically, can you speak to how the brand is doing when you factor out the ACV gains you're getting? Robert S. Sands: Well, we think that -- look, we don't have those -- those numbers are very hard to really ascertain across the whole business. But to put it very simply, I believe we've got 2 things going for us, which is number one, gains in ACV which are driving growth in the brand, as well as gains in velocity per point of distribution. So put in simple terms, I think that we've got growing same-store sales as well as growing distribution. So you basically are hitting on all cylinders as far as that goes. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Got it. Great. And then over on wine and spirits, this promotional need-more-money has been going on for a number of years. How are you thinking about the earnings algorithm for that business that you put out there back in June? Do you still feel good about that? Is it kind of a work in process? Can you speak to how you're thinking about that algorithm? I appreciate the comments on inputs coming down, but when you net it all together, how are you thinking about that? Robert S. Sands: Yes, I'd say that we feel very good about the algorithm and we stick by it. I'd say that we're disappointed, we don't feel good about the fact that we're probably a bit behind in achieving the algorithm. But I think as a general proposition, we feel probably more confident than ever as we go into next year and the year after, that we will be able to grow the process in this business. So look, we've been making some calculated decisions to invest behind this business and focus on brand-building and brand health, so that the business stays fundamentally healthy. I think that as far as the wine business goes, we've got the best and healthiest wine business in the industry. I think fundamentally, the category is a great category, growing faster than almost any other consumer staple category, taking share from the other categories. We know that, that is offset to some degree by some negatives around fragmentation and lack of brand loyalty in the same sense that it exists in certain spirits segments and beer segments, but nevertheless, it's an extremely strong consumer segment that has backing of the retailers. We're the major player in premium wines. And I think that Tim Ramey expressed what we believe is going to be the trends for the future. So I think we're going to be able to translate our strong position in wine, not only into sales and market share growth, but into profit growth as well. So we feel good about it. Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : So the final thing here and I appreciate -- I apologize, I'm taking so much time here, but a bit of a disconnect here with this year being flat to down slightly. Next year, you're basically saying you get back in terms of profit growth in wine and spirits. That's a function of inputs improving -- like if you had to put something at the top of the list, why are we supposed to think that that business, from a profit growth perspective, is going to get better? Robert S. Sands: Yes, so I'll give you a few simple answers to that, which is this business continues to grow nicely, number one. We probably don't see the need for increasing promotional activity in the future and input costs, which were significantly higher this year, will not be significantly higher next year. So the conditions are pretty good for profit growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of ISI Group. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Can you remind -- a couple of questions, can you remind us what percentage of your beer sales are draft right now? Robert P. Ryder: It may be 2%. Robert S. Sands: It's a very low 2% or 3%, whereas the industry overall is at 10%. Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Robert S. Sands: So it's pretty small. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Right. And what exactly -- I mean, there's a huge competition, right, for new taps for -- on the handles of -- with craft and everybody else. What is actually is your strategy in terms of -- what do you have to do to get people to change out? Robert S. Sands: Well, I think the great thing is that historically, there's been very pent-up demand for taps from our portfolio because we've had no draft, and our on-premise retailers have been calling and begging and asking for draft for many years. We didn't have it historically because it was the strategy of the owner of the brand, Modelo, prior to our acquisition of them, to not have draft in the United States. We didn't think that, that was a great position and we disagreed with it, but fundamentally, we didn't have any choice there. So as soon as we gained control of the brand, we've introduced draft, I think it's turned out to be a very good choice and has been completely additive to the business as opposed to cannibalistic, especially given the brands that we focused on for draft. So we don't have any trouble getting draft handles in the on-premise. So it doesn't take much of a strategy, given that it's a called-for item in most cases as opposed to a push-on. Think about the craft business, okay? You're talking about tiny little brands that nobody's ever heard of outside of their city and, in most cases, so yes, that requires a strategy to get people to put taps in on brands that nobody's ever heard of in a crowded and fragmented category. In our particular case, you're talking about the largest import brands that haven't had draft and now have draft that have a lot of consumer acceptance, which in fact, is actually building and growing, and therefore, our retailers are calling and asking for the taps. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Now look, that makes a huge amount of sense. Is there any reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of your business over time? Robert S. Sands: I would say that there's no reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of our business over time. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, the only pause for that is the Corona Extra strategy, which is very unique in the beer marketplace because it's so well-developed and the bottle is so much of the brand equity. So we'll go slowly on that. But other than that, it's go for everything we can get. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Terrific. Moving to the wine business, is there -- can you give us a sense of how the innovations are being received in the marketplace? And how -- and whether it's given the tremendous proliferation of SKUs in all of the categories, beer, wine and spirits, is it more difficult today to get new products out on the shelves than it was a few years ago? Robert S. Sands: Well, first of all, to the first part of your question, NPD is an interesting and tricky business and you don't expect to have 100% success, and NPD is sort of the nature of the animal. You have to have a good pipeline of it to get the occasional successes. And I'd say that true to that, we've got some really good successes. I think that if I was to say what I think is our #1 success right now, it's our brand, The Dreaming Tree, which is our joint venture with Dave Matthews, which we think is going to be a blockbuster brand in a very mix-accretive segment. We've got other NPD which I think is very solid, like our brand, Simply Naked, for instance in the super premium category. We've introduced some new products of late where we're seeing some very positive signs, a product called Besieged, which is a Sonoma product from our Ravenswood winery, which we actually saw a lot of success with. We've got a new product called SAVED, which we're very hopeful for. We've got an on-premise product called Hidden Crush. We introduced a new brand targeted towards millennials in the super premium category called Milestone, which we're seeing some early signs of success. So it's a little early to call. We've had some really good successes. I think, as I said, like Dreaming Tree is our #1 success. And then we've got a lot that we are in the process of developing at the current time and are -- I would say, have seen some early signs and are hopeful that we'll have some good successes in our pipeline. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And is it -- but is it more difficult now to get the shelf space than it was in the past? Robert S. Sands: I think it depends who you are. So as a general proposition across the industry, I'd say yes, because of the amount, even though if you really kind of look at what percentage NPD constitutes of the business, it's been pretty stable in wine for quite a number of years now, at -- running at around 6%. So it seems like there's a lot of proliferation, but it's generally been the case for a long time. Now I think it's depends on who you are, I'd say for the leaders in the industry that have strong distribution relationships and even more importantly, strong key account relationships. The answer is, is that we can get distribution on our new products, and across the total beverage alcohol business, wine, beer and spirits in the United States, there's really only a few leaders in what we call category management. Only a couple. Okay, there's 2 or 3 companies, ourselves and a couple of our other competitors are the only companies that have world-class category management, which really means that we are the leaders in having the relationship of the key accounts that are going to matter for the future. And clearly, there's a shift going on in the business away from smaller liquor stores, mom-and-pop stores, consumers purchasing product at the large chains and mass merchandisers. And I'd say that as a consequence of a larger organization geared against that, years and years of developing those relationships, we enjoy very strong relationships with those key accounts. So we can get the distribution. Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : That's great, and just one follow up on that. I saw that your relationship, I guess with Republic, was just renewed recently, I think a couple of months ago. Any change in terms that we should be aware of in that relationship? Robert S. Sands: No. Fundamentally, the terms of the renewal are very similar to the previous agreement. We think that it's a very favorable agreement, in fact, for both parties. And we expect to see continued great performance from RNDC as we have had over the previous contract. So that's a relationship and an agreement that's working very, very well for both the relationship and a mechanical perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Just a question on distribution opportunity with retailers seeing the kind of takeaway from your brand versus others, are you expecting some big shelf set changes in '14 calendar? Because again, that -- you were talking about the draft opportunity, but what is the takeaway opportunity as well? Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think we're looking at good growth in '14 across wine, beer and spirits. Our retail customers, are particularly pleased with our portfolio. I think that one of the interesting things about Constellation, which is an important differentiator is that we're the largest multi-category player in beverage alcohol or TBA as we call it, total beverage alcohol, which means that 2 of the large accounts, we're either the #1 or #2 supplier to them in dollar terms. And #1 is either us or ABI. And obviously, as it relates to our portfolio across wine, beer and spirits, we're providing the growth of being the #1 TBA supplier to the retailer. We're providing the growth, and TBA is probably the most important category in grocery and to the mass merchandisers today. It is not their #1 category, number one. Number two, of the major categories, it's the only growing category from both a dollar, top line and bottom line perspective, and it's providing much, much more profitability than any of the other major categories basically in grocery. And what are the other major categories, right? CSD [ph], cigarettes and dairy. So -- and TBA is #1, and we're either #1 or #2 with all the major players, right? Costco, SUPERVALU, Kroger, Safeway, so on and so forth. So -- and then, as I said, there's a shift that's just going on in general towards those kind of retailers for beverage alcohol. So, we're in a pretty good place. Robert P. Ryder: The other thing I'd follow -- I'd say, a very good place, the other thing I'd follow up with here and I think you might have been hinting specifically at beer because one of our compelling beer stories to retailers is the well-known national brands that we provide that -- and retail shelves turn very fast. So we all see all this stuff written about SKU-getting [ph] in craft beer, right? And we're kind of used in this in wine, but there are a lot of SKUs. It does get a little confusing in the beer aisle these days, but we believe when we go to retailers, we have a very good story that, look, we have the distribution opportunity with our non-Corona Extra brands that we think will turn much better than almost all craft brands and deserve more shelf space. Indeed, we think Corona Extra deserves a lot more shelf space than it gets because it also turns much better than craft beers. It also grows like craft beers, right? Another reason to give it more space. And it has a higher ring and more profitability to the retailer like craft beers. So we think we're like -- to a retailer, we provide a lot of the benefits of craft beers, but we have much more scale and obviously, much more tenure in the industry to actually help them do some category management, that maybe the smaller, newer craft beers aren't as expert at yet. So I think that is really -- and we have fantastic sales execution and fantastic marketing plans behind those brands, so it's really kind of synchronistic to get this volume growth. The consumers want it, the retailers want it, the distributors want it, and, of course, we want it. Caroline Levy : That makes sense. And then just looking at the brewery, you've owned it very briefly, but can you just fill us in on what you've discovered about running a brewery since you've owned it? Robert P. Ryder: It's big. So I'll start -- here's what I'll say, is we -- and Rob said this earlier, that the employees we inherited at the brewery, we couldn't be happier with. They fit right into Constellation's culture. They are expert at their job and... Robert S. Sands: Highly skilled. Robert P. Ryder: And highly skilled. And really, it's been fantastically turnkey for us and we've been able to focus more our attention on the buildout, which they're also critical to. And the other good thing we inherited is the way Modelo ran the business was pretty decentralized. So we inherited a brewery with full functions. Human resource, finance, they operate very well as a team, and every -- they fit in so well with us because there's a lot of changes and a lot of complexity on assimilating this brewery and I couldn't give a higher grade than the grade we give them on assimilation, and as Rob said, real expertise in their jobs we're thrilled with. Hopefully, they're happy with us. Caroline Levy : And in terms of risks of delays and stuff, which happens with any big project, generally, how would you handicap the risks of things not going exactly on time and on -- in terms of just not getting exactly where you thought you would be over the next 2 to 3 years? Robert S. Sands: Right now, we anticipate completing the project on time, and we would handicap it as a low probability that we will not be able to finish the project on time. Caroline Levy : Okay. And the spending being a little lower than maybe expected in the current quarter, last quarter, do you fully expect to catch up in the fourth quarter on that? Robert S. Sands: Yes. Robert P. Ryder: Yes, and spending will really ramp up. As Rob said, we're fabricating stainless steel, we're breaking ground, and the beehive will start being built because there's going to be a lot of activity around doubling the capacity of this brewery. Caroline Levy : Okay. And then just moving to wine, and it's been a while since I looked at this in detail, but apparently, there is a lot of supply. And vats are full in Napa, in particular. Does that not mean there will be a lot of private label competition and so on? I mean, could margins be a little worse than you expect again as you go forward? Robert S. Sands: I would say that the supply is balanced, is the way that I would describe it. I would say it's actually, over the last couple of years, depending on exactly where you're looking at, it sort of tips to slight undersupply. We've had a couple of decent harvests, which have, I'd say, tipped it to what I would call pretty much balanced. In the areas that matter to us, I would say that we're not expecting an oversupply that would drive lower pricing or higher promotion in the future. I think that we see a pretty balanced situation. And in fact, this is a general proposition, the way the wine business is growing overall and sort of given the level of plantings, especially, if we're talking about the United States. Things will continue to tip more towards undersupply. Robert P. Ryder: I mean, that's a point -- I mean, the consumer demand for wine continues to be very robust and the mix shift also continues to be positive. So we actually need more supply just to satiate demand. Caroline Levy : Okay. Great. And then just finally on the distributor renegotiations that are probably coming up with a number of wine and spirits distributors, do you largely expect similar terms to the ones you have, or is there room for some improvement for you there? Robert S. Sands: I would say that we are hopeful. I think, first of all, I think we had great terms -- we have great terms to begin with, but I would be hopeful that there's room for improvement. Generally, that's going to be win-win for both parties. I mean, as we renegotiate these parties' contract, both parties look at the agreement to see what's working, what's not working, and adjustments are made to enhance the relationship for both parties. It's really the nature of it here, especially with wholesalers. It's not a one side can exact some kind of extreme favorable term out of the other side for no reason. But yes, we expect that there will be favorable enhancements to our agreements. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan. Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I have one quick balance sheet question here. The accounts payable were a little higher than expected for me, and I'm wondering if the terms are just different in the beer business than in the wine business? Or is there a timing issue going on there? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, terms are different in beer and wine, mostly due to regulations. So the accounts receivable terms are lower in beer than they are in wine, which is good working capital outcome. Accounts payable, there's just a lot of stuff going on with us assimilating brewery, there's a lot of timing stuff going on there. Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then your cash flow, your strong guidance for the year, does that imply you should just take every 2014 million -- I'm sorry, 2014 bond maturity with cash flow, or do you intend to refinance it? Robert P. Ryder: Yes, we're still looking at that. But we'll -- in this environment, we're happy to see that go because I think it's at 8 3/8. Right now, the thinking is we won't have to refinance that. It'll just be financed from our revolver and securitization facilities which, of course, are at much lower coupons. That should be very positive arbitrage for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Eltrich of Mitsubishi. Karen Eltrich : As we look at the year ahead, what are your thoughts with regards to priority of free cash flow, and as you make your manufacturing expansions, what kind of capacity increases can we expect? Robert P. Ryder: Well, I mean, our priorities in the medium term on free cash flow is to pay down debt, which we've been doing. As we said, our debt was about $165 million less in Q3. We paid some debt down. We want to get our leverage below 4x EBITDA, but as you referred to, we've got a lot of builds coming our way. We've got, I'll say, the final tranche on purchase price, which we referred to right nets [ph] -- just shy of $600 million, which we talked about. And then we've got the brewery buildout, which, of course, is pretty big money over 3 years and a decent amount of that is front-loaded. So -- but we think we have all the financing we need to pay those bills, and we still think we can get below 4x EBITDA leverage by fiscal '17. Because you see, the beer this year is generating more cash than we originally anticipated. So we'll take it and pay that debt down. Karen Eltrich : Great. And then in terms of what kind of capacity expansion is -- are these builds going to produce for you? Robert P. Ryder: Well, the brewery is doubling its capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters. Operator : As of this time, there are no further questions. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any closing remarks. Robert S. Sands: Well, thanks for joining our call today, everyone. Needless to say, we're very excited about the fact that our newly consolidated beer business is performing extremely well and driving enhanced consolidated results for the year. We certainly believe that we are well positioned in both wine and spirits as we currently stand, and are confident that our accomplishments in these businesses will position us well for the future. And overall, we feel very good about a solid final quarter for our fiscal year. So thanks, again, for your participation. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brand's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty and good morning and welcome to our year end call. Well, it has certainly been another productive and very exciting year at Constellation. It was just about one year ago at this time when we received regulatory approval to proceed with the completion of our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company. As you know, the beer deal has positioned Constellation as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine, and spirits. We are not only the third largest total beverage alcohol company in the United States, but the number three brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market as well as the largest marketer of imported beer. And to reinforce our position as a top-tiered player in this space, we posted the highest dollar sales growth in IRI channels for fiscal 2014 amongst our key competitors in the total beverage alcohol category. Our fiscal 2014 results are a testament to the significant contribution that our beer business is making as we had an exceptional year posting sales, profits and cash flow that were better than our expectations for both the Crown commercial business and our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. The beer segment generated sales growth of 10% with corresponding depletion growth of nearly 8%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. As a matter of fact, in fiscal 2014, our beer business accounted for 85% of total import category dollar sales growth and gained more than 50 basis points of market share of the U.S. beer industry in IRI channels. So what\u2019s driving this phenomenal level of growth, it\u2019s a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year\u2019s amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands. As you know Corona Extra is the best selling imported beer at more than 100 million cases and is now outselling the nearest import competitor by almost 50 million cases. By executing well designed marketing campaigns and leveraging its brand equity, Corona Extra posted depletion growth of almost 4% in group volumes by nearly 2.5 million cases in fiscal 2014, jumping to the fifth best selling beer overall, while posting positive volume trends for the third consecutive year. As for Corona Light it is the best selling imported light beer at more than 13.5 million cases and continues to strengthen its own identity with its creative advertising that is driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Overall Corona Light is outpacing the import light category and currently represents more than 50% of segment dollar share in IRI channels. Modelo Especial is the fastest growing Constellation beer brand, with depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2014. It exceeded the 50 million case milestones during the year with the most volume gains and largest volume trend of any top 15 beer brand. Pacifico increased volumes 5%, which marks three consecutive years of volume growth and Negra Modelo posted its fourth consecutive year of annual volume growth at 4%. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format, increasing brand recognition for Corona Light, Negra Modelo, and Pacifico brand throughout fiscal 2014. The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 imports and collectively account for more than 175 million cases representing greater than 50% of the volume of this category in 2013. Overall, as we begin fiscal 2015, we will be focused on the following strategies from our beer business perspective. The continued expansion of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico, which I will discuss in more detail in a few moments, maintaining the marketplace momentum for the commercial side of the beer business with incremental investments in marketing and SG&A and finally driving the great organic growth opportunities within this product portfolio. I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015, as we are once again targeting sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import trends. Some of the initiatives we have underway to drive these results include the following. As we head into the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we will continue to build our Corona de Mayo equity to reinforce our positioning around Summer\u2019s First Fiesta to create momentum to keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kick off our 120 Days of Summer. Our 120 Days of Summer campaign will highlight 18 different weekly themes with special activities, content and prize drawings. The goal is to own the summer by driving repeat consumer engagement and purchase throughout the key summer selling season. New Corona national TV and digital video that launched recently to support these efforts will ramp up leading into Cinco de Mayo with high profile media properties that includes the NBA Playoffs on national TV. In addition, promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships will launch leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and the ESPN NFL Draft. To continue to reach new consumers and increase awareness of the brand, Corona Light recently expanded its draft offering to over 100 distributors and 35 markets. This launch will be supported by 15-second advertising spots airing with high profile sports programs that position the brand as a light beer with taste. Two new ads from Modelo Especial\u2019s Hispanic Real World campaign will launch in the first quarter with strong support and targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming. In addition, Modelo Especial will feature a 2014 summer promotion that includes a sweepstake with three prize tiers, including a custom soccer tour to three global soccer destinations. A natural launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began April 1. This initiative is supported by Spanish-language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumers sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. In its first six months since launch, Modelo Especial Chelada has significantly outpaced our distribution and volume forecast. From a brewery and operational perspective, we began fiscal 2014 by successfully completing the initial transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. As you know, we are currently concentrating our effort on doubling the size of this brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters, including the build of a new brew house, packaging area and warehouse as well as completion of site infrastructure. Overall, beer operations continue to run smoothly. The beer expansion project remains on time and all major brewery key performance metrics and initiatives are on or better than target. Establishing foundations for the brewing area are well underway. Mass excavation for the packaging area is in progress and the first shipment of brewery tanks is expected to arrive shortly. There are more than 500 construction people on site each day with that number growing significantly over the next few months. As we have progressed with this major undertaking, we have determined that we need to increase the capital required to complete the brewery expansion from our original estimate of $500 million to $600 million. The primary drivers of the increased investment to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion include the following. This most significant incremental cost related to outsourcing and utilizing third-party external engineering resources and consultants versus the initial brewery build by Modelo, which has the benefit of utilizing in-house resources. In addition, the timeline for the current expansion is much shorter than that of Modelo\u2019s original build resulting in additional costs for expediting much of this project. Other incremental expenses include inflation on materials since the original brewery build and investments to improve brewery efficiency and flexibility to enhance overall capacity utilization in order to support the growth of the business. In a few moments, Bob will provide additional details about how this incremental spend will impact free cash flow and our de-leveraging efforts going forward. Now, turning to the wine and spirits business, before we begin our year end review and discussion of our wine and spirits plans for fiscal 2015, I\u2019d like to mention that I am very pleased we have reached a long-term strategic agreement with VATS Liquor, a Chinese producer and distributor of spirits and wine. We plan to jointly develop and exclusively market and promote the iconic Robert Mondavi brand, which is world\u2019s number one selling table wine. And China, China is currently the fifth largest wine consumption market globally selling more than 200 million cases annually. It\u2019s a market that has doubled in size in five years. Category growth in China continues to be driven by imports which are projected to comprise about one-third of total wine consumption within the next five years. We are looking forward to working with VATS who has a vast distribution network, professional brand building capabilities and an established retail presence for consumers to buy fine wine and spirits. And now I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation\u2019s year end results for our wine and spirits business as well as our strategic plans for the year ahead. As we discussed, fiscal 2014 represented the year of focus on brand building activity for our U.S. wine and spirits business in order to ensure that our business remained healthy and was positioned to generate profit growth going forward. These activities included incremental promotion and marketing investments that enabled us to maintain our marketplace momentum by achieving market share volume gains and above market depletion trends of 3.5% across our entire U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, while our collection of Focus Brands grew at almost 6% for the year. In addition, we were able to maintain dollar share in measured channels. As a result of these efforts, we continue to garner awards and recognition for prominent industry publications, particularly for our new products and our Focus Brands. They include the following. We won 11 2013 Hot Brand awards from Impact Magazine and several of our new brands landed on Beverage Information Group\u2019s list of 2014 Growth Brand Awards. Our Focus Brands that received these awards included Kim Crawford, Mark West, Black Box, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge, just to name a few. And our new product offers \u2013 offerings included on the awards list were The Dreaming Tree and Thorny Rose. The Dreaming Tree also received the distinction of Best New Wine Product from MarketWatch. From a spirits perspective, for fiscal 2014 SVEDKA posted double digit consumers takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining volume and dollar share of the vodka category. SVEDKA is currently the number two imported vodka brand and a top 10 spirit brand in the U.S. In fiscal 2015, we plan to capitalize on the continued growth of flavored vodkas by launching Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA\u2019s flavor lineup. For the year, Black Velvet grew volumes 11% in IRI channels driven by the core Black Velvet brand as well as new flavor introductions Toasted Caramel and Cinnamon Rush. From a wine and spirits strategic perspective in fiscal 2015, we plan to leverage the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last several years to grow profits for this business, while also growing revenue. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. Number one, our marketing efforts will be focused on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Number two, we will continue to drive margin accretive innovation and new product development. Number three, we plan to increase points of distribution and deliver more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Number four, for the first time in several years we plan to execute price increases for select products in the value and luxury segments of the market where pricing is currently occurring. And number five we will minimize COGS increase through continued global blend management initiatives and lower grape cost. Overall, we plan to limit our marketing expense to grow in line with our net revenue with the concentration of spend focused on key margin accretive Focus Brands. One of the things that will impact fiscal 2015 financial results for our wine and spirits business, particularly in the first quarter is that we are working with one of our exclusive distributors to reduce their inventory levels. Because this action is outside the scope of their contractual arrangement with us, they have agreed to a make whole payment as they begin to reduce their purchases of our products. As I mentioned, this is primarily a first quarter event and will have a minor impact on sales for the year. In a few minutes, Bob will discuss the financial implications of this action from a P&L perspective. Before I close, I would like to address the potential drought issue in California as we have received several inquiries related to this topic. Fortunately, grape wines are highly drought resistant and can actually produce better fruit in dry conditions. At this stage, our California wines have begun to bud and the state in general is running approximately two weeks ahead of schedule. While recent heavy rains have improved our overall position, California is still officially in drought status and at this time we do not yet know the potential overall impact from this situation, because it is too early to call. If drought conditions persist, we have the ability to source bulk wine from around the world in order to supplement which could potentially be a short harvest. Keep in mind that an above average harvest last year created a situation, where we currently have adequate supply. In closing, we had a great year driven by our beer business. We also achieved above market depletion growth and market share gains across our beer and wine businesses. The strong operating cash flow that we are generating will allow us to capitalize on value creating opportunities going forward and the new Constellation is well-positioned to drive value for the future. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year end business results and our outlook for fiscal 2015. Bob Ryder : Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. As we close out fiscal \u201814 and move forward into fiscal \u201815 which is very exciting time at Constellation for employees, investors, lenders, vendors and consumers. As Rob said, fiscal \u201814 was a very strong year, where we closed our beer transaction, maintained or grew market share and are growing beverage alcohol categories, established some all-time highs with EBIT up nearly 60% and comparable basis EPS almost 50% while generating sales approaching $5 billion and free cash flow which surpassed the $600 million mark. And we exceeded all consolidated guidance metrics provided at the beginning of the year. We expect fiscal \u201815 to be another exciting year. We expect to maintain or grow market share and grow EBIT at or above our sales growth on an organic basis. On an absolute comparable basis, performance will be much better as we enjoy our full year of consolidated beer economics and we expect operating cash flow to cross the $1 billion mark. Let\u2019s begin to look at fiscal \u201814 results. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for fiscal \u201814 came in at $3.25. This represents a sizable increase versus last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. The strong marketplace momentum and financial performance for the beer business continued in Q4. This drove year-to-date financial results ahead of our expectations and capped off a phenomenal year for Constellation. Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at full year fiscal 2014 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for the year included $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. For fiscal 2014, beer segment net sales increased nearly 10% on volume growth of 7%. Depletions were equally strong growing close to 8%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 2%. This reflects an organic branded wine and spirits shipment volume increase of almost 4%, partially offset by higher promotion expense, unfavorable mix, and lower bulk spirit sales. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $892 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognized our share of Crown\u2019s earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction, 100% of Crown\u2019s results along with the Mexican beer production profit stream are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $891 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 44% based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 41.2% versus 39.9% for the prior year. This increase primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the beer business, partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, driven by the higher promotion expense. SG&A for the year increased $280 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $260 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown as the brewery has very little costs classified as SG&A. The remainder of the SG&A increase was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing investments in the wine and spirits business. Based on what I just outlined, incremental operating income generated by the beer business was $630 million for the year. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 31% since the close of the acquisition. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver between the \u2013 behind the 410 basis point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the year. Equity earnings from the Crown joint venture totaled $70 million compared to $220 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $323 million, up 42% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7 billion. This represents a $3.7 billion increase from our debt levels at the end of fiscal \u201813. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. I would also like to remind you that in June, we expect to make a $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. We also have $500 million of 8 3/8% senior notes that are coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 31%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business and the benefit of foreign tax credits. Now, let\u2019s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.81. The quarter reflected significant acquisition benefits. And as mentioned earlier, beer performance exceeded expectations. For Q4, beer segment net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 10%. This was somewhat offset \u2013 this was somewhat of an easier comparison versus Q4 last year when sales increased 1%. Consumer demand remained strong as depletions for the quarter were up nearly 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 1% as volume growth was mostly offset by unfavorable mix and higher promotional spend. Now, let\u2019s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal \u201814, we generated $603 million of free cash flow versus $494 million in the previous year. This result exceeded our expectation primarily as a result of the strong beer business performance in Q4. Operating cash flow for the year totaled $826 million, an increase of $270 million over last year. The increase was primarily due to the profit growth for the beer business acquisition partially offset by higher interest payments and lower contribution from wine and spirits primarily due to some working capital timing. CapEx for the year totaled $224 million, an increase of $161 million. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $137 million. Most of the beer spending occurred in the fourth quarter as brewery expansion activities began to ramp up. Now, let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 a share. For fiscal 2015, we are targeting mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth for the beer segment. Shipment and depletion volumes are targeted to grow mid single-digits and continue to outpace the import category and the total beer industry. For fiscal 2014, beer segment operating income totaled $773 million. This amount is presented in our summarized segment information in our press release financial statements and includes 100% of Crown\u2019s operating income for all of fiscal 2014 and brewery profits since the June 7 acquisition date. For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the low to mid 20% range. Excluding the estimated brewery acquisition benefit, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the 10% to 12% range. For wine and spirits, we are targeting net sales growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range and we expect to generate positive mix. While we expect depletions to track in line or better than the U.S. wine and spirits category for the year, shipment volumes are projected to be lower than depletions as we expect some distributor inventory reduction to occur during the first quarter as Rob highlighted earlier. Operating income growth for wine and spirits is expected to align with net sales growth in the low to mid single-digit range. Headwinds from grape costs are expect to abate as we continue to realize benefits from blend management initiatives and we begin to move into lower priced grape inventories. We expect promotional and marketing spending to stabilize and we are increasing prices on some products in the value and luxury categories as Rob outlined earlier. We also expect mix to be favorable in the fiscal \u201815 as we focus more of our investment on higher margin products. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million. The increase versus fiscal \u201814 is primarily being driven by the beer acquisition funding impact that carries into Q1 of fiscal \u201815. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30%. This represents a slight decrease versus the fiscal \u201814 comparable basis tax rate as we expect to realize some favorable outcomes on various tax items. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. Operating cash flow is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. CapEx is projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million, including $450 million to $500 million for the beer business driven by the brewery expansion activities outlined by Rob. We are still on track to complete the brewery in calendar 2016. Although the brewery expansion CapEx is higher than our original estimate, beer volumes and profits are also higher. Even with the higher CapEx spend, our goals of reaching $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal \u201817 and moving our debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio below four times in fiscal \u201816 remain intact. I would now like to mention a couple of items from a fiscal \u201815 quarterly gating perspective. As discussed earlier for wine and spirits, we expect some distributor inventory destocking to mostly occur during Q1, which will impact our shipment volume. As a result, we expect net sales to be down in the low to mid-single digit range for Q1. However, we don\u2019t expect this to negatively impact profits as we will receive a make-whole payment from the distributor related to this activity in the same timeframe. I would also like to note that our targeted wine and spirits EBIT growth for fiscal \u201815 is weighted toward the second half of the year. From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that we will be facing some difficult comparisons in the second half of the year. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. We currently estimate one-time cost at $60 million in fiscal \u201815. This includes about $25 million in professional services and transition costs associated with the beer business acquisition. These costs were originally expected to occur in fiscal \u201814, but shifted to fiscal \u201815. The remaining $35 million represents amortization expense related to the acquisition accounting asset established for the interim supply agreement for beer finished goods. I would like to make a few brief comments on commodity risk management. We have begun to hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result mark to market unrealized gains and losses on open hedge contracts will flow through our GAAP income statement. We will exclude these unrealized gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a gain or loss is realized on a commodity hedged, it will be allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with other companies in the consumer space. We began this reporting in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal \u201814, it was an immaterial unrealized gain related to this activity. Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight that the beer acquisition has been a game changer. In addition to the positive financial impact of the acquisition, our commercial performance has accelerated dramatically. Despite the increased cost to build out the brewery, our improved commercial results keep our free cash flow and deleveraging goals intact. The improved commercial performance of the beer business improves our financial profile and we currently anticipate exceeding our original IRR and shareholder value assumptions for the beer transaction despite higher capital costs for the 20 million hectoliter build out. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC. Nik Modi - RBC: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two questions on my end. If you can just kind of reiterate, I am sorry if I missed it, how much CapEx has already been spent on the brewery expansion. And then the second question is really trying to frame the opportunity that you might have in China, certainly long-term it makes sense and probably a big opportunity, just trying to get some texture on how much of a P&L implication it could have in the next 18 months or so? Bob Ryder : Sure, Nik. I will handle the first one and Rob can handle the China question. As far as how much capital was spent on the brewery in fiscal \u201814 that was just shy of $140 million and that pretty much all occurred in the fourth quarter. Nik Modi - RBC: On to China? Rob Sands : Sure. Hi, Nik. China, I think you really have to look at that as the long-term investment or I would say a long-term project. We are just really kind of getting up and running and developing our plans. It hasn\u2019t been a material business there historically. So, the idea is developing it into a material business in that market, but it\u2019s going to take a number of years. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have any real impact from a financial perspective in the short-term. Nik Modi - RBC: Great. And just one quick follow-up, I know it\u2019s still early in the transaction, but the margins have been tracking ahead of I think what most people have been expecting and I know there is still a lot of spending to come in the beer business, but have you thought about the 30% to 35% since you kind of initially gave that guidance, and if you think there is kind of where you might be in that range at the higher end maybe even able to exceed that at some point in the next couple of years? Bob Ryder : Yes Nik. We are not updating our guidance in that area. We would be happy if it exceeds it, but we have still got quite a few of steps involved in negotiating our commodity contracts as a standalone company. Going forward, as you know, we have talked about \u2013 we haven\u2019t settled anything on glass, which is a big piece of the cost, cost inputs for our business. So, we are very happy with the progress of the project, certainly the progress of the beer business, but we are not changing our margin guidance. What might be throwing people off a little bit is maybe in the fourth quarter, the beer business had increased margins and really what that is, is in the fourth quarter again I think volumes exceeded our expectations, but we spent accounting wise very little marketing in the fourth quarter. So, you had a pretty high level of sale certainly growth to the prior year with very little marketing expense against it. For the full year, the margin from the date of acquisition through the end of year was about 31%, which was a little bit higher than what we guided when the transaction just started, but very much in the ballpark. So, we are sticking to that mid 30% operating profit margin guidance. Nik Modi - RBC: Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Hey, good morning. Rob Sands : Hey, Bryan. Bob Ryder : Hey, Bryan. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Just two questions, the first one just related to the capital spending in, I think this is the crux of why the stock has responded the way it has this morning. Bob, could you walk through first now that you have got a better sort of perspective or a deeper perspective on the project and the cost increase. Is the brewery going to be more efficient and is there an enhancement in efficiencies both in the existing capacity and maybe what you are going to be building versus what you originally thought? And then the second question related to that is just I think there is some concern and you have got the run rate right now on volume growth and beer is very strong and how do we think about the potential to have to add more capacity going forward? Does the increase in spending at all make it less expensive to add capacity going forward? Rob Sands : So, yes, Bryan, I will answer that for you. Number one, the fundamental answer to your question is yes, we are designing the brewery in a manner to get more volume out of the capacity that we originally planned. So, we are expanding the brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters in theoretical capacity that still remains the case, but in terms of the efficiency, i.e., how many cases will actually get out of that? We are expanding the brewery in a manner to get more cases out of that than we originally planned. That\u2019s point number one. So, we are taking steps in that regard to plan for higher volumes than we originally anticipated. And then with respect to your second question, the capacity that we are currently building we do expect to be sufficient on four, I would say the mid-term meaning the next few years. But if the business continues to grow at the rate that it\u2019s currently growing, we will have to be thinking about additional capacity increases sometime in the near future in the next couple of years and to begin that process so a good problem to have in essence. Bob Ryder : Yes. And Bryan just to follow-up on Rob, we are currently assessing because volumes are doing so well. When do you expand capacity and where do you expand capacity, so related to that question if we were to put the next tranche of capacity expansion at the existing brewery, I think we would get some efficiencies from the $1 billion we are spending on the first 20 million hectoliters. If we decided to put the capacity somewhere else meaning you build another brewery or buy a brewery somewhere, then that wouldn\u2019t help us so much. So we are currently in the thought process around that. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : And then fair to characterize the higher price tag especially for the outsourcing in part helps to ensure that you meet the calendar \u201916 deadline, meaning you are sort of paying to get the front of the line? Rob Sands : Yes, there is definitely a premium that we are paying to complete the project within the three year timeframe. There is no question about that. It\u2019s pretty much half the timeframe in which the original brewery is built and it\u2019s a pretty compressed timetable. And we have got to do everything in our power to ensure that the brewery is built in that timeframe, so. Bob Ryder : Yes, we are happy to see that even with that increased capital costs as I mentioned earlier because I know a lot of investors are keeping an eye on our de-leveraging and keeping an eye on when we potentially reallocate capital. So all those de-leveraging targets and free cash flow targets even though we have increased these capital spend they all remain intact. So frankly after you get past the brewery, right what that means and you guys know your math guys right is the EBIT higher, right. So that\u2019s going to drive much better returns after you get past this stage where kind of the snake is eating a camel. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Got it. Okay, I am going to get back in the queue. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Just want to follow-up one more time on Bryan\u2019s questions, excuse me. So I was just to trying to understand over the past maybe six to nine months at what point did it seems like the timeline for the new plant is still the same and the size is still the same, where did all of a sudden it changed in terms of your budgeted costs, I mean what came about really changed that versus what we saw kind of six to nine months ago when you are first talking about this? Rob Sands : Yes, well six to nine months ago we had obviously just closed the deal. We have very short timeframe to actually decide and agree to purchase the brewery and purchase it, we put together at that time a very rough estimate of what we thought the cost would be and we spent the last basically nine months bidding out the project and translating it into definitive cost which have resulted in the number that we disclosed. So there was definitely changes in the scope of the project from what we also originally \u2013 what we originally thought. And it was along the lines that Bryan suggested in that, although we are building the same 20 million theoretical capacity, okay and we expect to get more out of it and scope the project to get more out of it than originally planned. So whereas you might only get 80% or 85% efficiency out of your theoretical capacity, we are building the brewery now to get more out of it than that. Really as the result of the increased growth in the products that we are experiencing and that we expect to continue into the next fiscal years. So that\u2019s basically why or how the brewery project cost increased from our original estimates which were really in many respects just a swag, in that we \u2013 it had not been able at that stage and obviously so to bid the project and to scope it fully. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. And then just a couple of things also on the beer, wasn\u2019t there at some point a change in the price you are paying for the 40% outsourced and will that change, any update on that? And then on the beer pricing in general is your guide to assuming a price increase for kind of the fiscal 2015? Bob Ryder : Yes, there was a price reset for what we pay InBev for the finished goods that they are making for us based on the audited EBITDA of the acquired business, but building the brewery out does not change any of that. Those numbers are still intact. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Sure. And then in terms of overall pricing for this year to the consumer for the next year? Bob Ryder : Yes, I mean, on pricing, we will \u2013 as we said before, beer is a very regional business. So, we look at what\u2019s going on with volumes and what\u2019s going on with competitors in our various different regions and we talk to distributors, we talk to retailers to try to assume what will happen to volumes, what will consumers\u2019 reactions be to the price increase, and then we determine what that price increase will be on a regional basis, then it kind of rolls up. So, the only way you will know kind of what happens is to watch IRI, generally beer pricing occurs right after the peak summer season. So, September, October, you will be able to see what the big boys have done and what we have done and we take a guess generally what pricing would be when we give guidance. So that\u2019s included in the volume and net sales guidance you would have seen in our beer segment. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. One of my questions is can you tell us what the difference was between beer volumes in California and in the rest of the country? I am trying to drive at mainly what the drought impact was on demand, but also my understanding is that in areas where Corona is strongest, it\u2019s actually growing faster. So, if you can just sort of disaggregate a little bit of what you understand about your beer business? Bob Ryder : Yes, there is a couple of things going on there, Caroline. We actually did have a very strong year in California. It\u2019s our highest share state. It\u2019s kind of where Corona began. I think we are around 20% share. But as Rob mentioned in his statements, right, they are experiencing a drought in California, so actually we experienced very good beer weather in California. And we also have like elsewhere in the country, very good consumer momentum from our great marketing and our great sales initiatives, but we did have pretty favorable weather for beer in California and we are very happy with our results out there in fiscal \u201814. Caroline Levy - CLSA: But I am just trying to understand what happened in the rest of the country, was the rest of the country up sort of mid single-digit? Bob Ryder : Yes, we had our strongest performance in fiscal \u201814 in the west and the south. We had strong performance, but not as strong in the Midwest and the East. Okay, it\u2019s kind of how we broke out regionally, but we grew in every geography, we gained share in every geography, we grew in every channel, we gained share in every channel, but we did better in the west and the south. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right, okay, thank you. Now, just moving to wine, the issue with the distributor inventories is this one distributor, is this something that\u2019s a one quarter phenomenon, if you could just help us understand a little more about what\u2019s going on there and how long it will take to work through the system? Bob Ryder : Sure. It\u2019s \u2013 yes, the answer is it\u2019s one distributor and yes, we are anticipating that it will be a one quarter or first quarter phenomenon and as we mentioned it will have no impact on our bottom line, no impact on earnings whatsoever. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Okay. And as we think through one, I mean it\u2019s always got challenges, but always for different reasons, but as a long-term top line growth rate is 3% to 4% reasonable sort of assumption given a blend of volume and \u2013 I mean volume and pricing do you think that still holds? Bob Ryder : Yes, Caroline definitely sort of the 3%, 4% range is sort of a good number that\u2019s sort of what the industry has been growing at. We are pretty optimistic about our wine business going into this year, our 2015 fiscal year as I have mentioned we got a lot of I am going to say tailwind this year. We have been focusing for the last few years on developing strong momentum behind our brands making sure our brands are healthy. And as we move into 2015, I think that our brands are healthier than they have ever been and that positions our self well to capitalize on that and take some actions to drive profit growth as I said. So I think that that business is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to make a very good contribution to our bottom line growth this year. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of ISI. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Thank you, guys. Can you give us your latest assessment in terms of when you may start paying a dividend, has that changed and also your thinking on M&A, is there any change there? Bob Ryder : Sure, I will handle the first. I will let Rob handle the second. The dividend we haven\u2019t changed the way we are thinking about it is we would start assessing redeploying capital to shareholders when we get close to being below four times EBITDA leverage and that goal has not changed. It looks like that will happen if everything happens the way we think towards the end of fiscal \u201816 is when we will get below that leverage ratio. So we would start to talk to investors and our Board in inverse order of course around that time. I will let Rob handle the M&A question. Rob Sands : Yes. So on M&A the answer is our position or our strategy has not changed relative to M&A. Our principle goal at the moment is debt pay down that\u2019s really what we are focused on, but obviously M&A is opportunistic, so we keep our ear to the ground for investments that we think will generate superior returns to our shareholders. But generally the focus is debt pay down versus M&A. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: And Bob, given the tremendous success of the beer business that you are achieving and the transformation of the company as you look to do incremental investment, do you see yourself gearing more towards beer or more towards wine, has that changed at all in terms of where you are looking to take the company long-term? Rob Sands : Well, as I have said, we are certainly focused on debt pay down at the current time, but as it relates to investments there is potentially good investments in all three categories. We look at it very fundamentally. I mean, we don\u2019t have a favorite child necessarily. And so as opportunities arise we are going to look at investment opportunities in all three categories. And they will be evaluated on what generates the highest return in the shortest amount of time. That\u2019s basically the bottom line right, IRR and payback. So we will see. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Are you taking a look at PBR? Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Okay, Robert, I think we are going to move to the next question. Rob Sands : Well, we can\u2019t comment on that obviously Robert. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Alright, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Good morning, guys. Two questions, one on the beer side, one on the wine side, on the beer side, I am not sure if I missed it in your commentary, but what was marketing or what are you planning marketing to be up in \u201814? Bob Ryder : In \u201815 or in \u201814? Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : I am sorry in fiscal \u201815? Bob Ryder : Yes. So in the beer business, we are investing commercially both sales and marketing, investing ahead of sales, because we want to keep our momentum up and because the sales and marketing guys have some good ideas that we think are worthy of investing in. So marketing and sales will be going up faster than sales. Marketing in the beer business is about 8%, 8.5% of sales which has gone up over the last three to five years. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Perfect. And then on the wine side, back to the distributor inventory reduction, how did that come about, who drove it, and as some of your other distributor contracts come to an end if memory serves, would you expect to see more of these types of deals? And then as a side to that, when these things have happened in the past, sometimes you hedge your distributors than more against the brands in the market, this time you are getting a payment, can you just explain your thoughts on receiving a payment versus a greater investment in the marketplace from your distributor? Rob Sands : Sure. Number one, this is the particular circumstances of one distributor who desired to do something really outside of the parameters of our normal business relationship. That\u2019s the answer number one. Answer number two is no, we don\u2019t have any expectation that it will occur in any other context or in any other cases. And number three since it\u2019s outside of our normal contractual relationship we felt that a make whole kind of arrangement was most appropriate in this particular case. And more importantly, as far as what we invest in the marketplace behind our business, we determine that completely on a commercial basis meaning it\u2019s not based on any payments that we might receive or might not receive. We will spend what we think is appropriate to drive the business in any event. So it just still happens that with the way this particular transaction is structured, we don\u2019t expect it to have any impact on the bottom line. And it is a \u2013 it is an isolated matter with one wholesale customer. So we bring it really to your attention and only in that it will affect the top line. In the first quarter, we really expect the top line materially even for the whole year. And as you said, it will have no impact on the bottom line. So that\u2019s really, that\u2019s it. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Perfect, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Hunt of Wells Fargo Securities. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Two questions. One, Rob, when you start to talk about pricing and the value in the luxury segment of the wine business, it sounded as though you were a follower and not a leader, can you discuss maybe the level of pricing and clarify whether Constellation is leading or following price increases in the wine segment? Rob Sands : Yes, I would say, we have about a 15% total market share in the wine segment. As you know, it\u2019s a pretty fragmented category compared to the other two categories in the beverage, alcohol business. Therefore, I am not even sure to talk of being a leader in this and that is even particularly relevant. We take a look at our products. We take a look at the competition. We take a look at the categories. We see what\u2019s happening. And we decide what we are going to do. Over the last few years, there hasn\u2019t been much pricing in the wine business period. We are seeing some opportunities for pricing as we move into our fiscal \u201815 and we are going to take those opportunities that we think that they are in the high end and the lower end. So that\u2019s where we are going to focus in terms of that element of our strategy. So it\u2019s really as simple as that. I don\u2019t think leader or follower makes a lot of sense in terms of even the discussion in this particular context. But yes, we look around, we see what\u2019s going in the marketplace and we make our judgments in that regard. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : And with regards to magnitude, is there any comments around that you feel to make? Rob Sands : No. I mean, we are really developing our plans and our strategies for taking the pricing in the areas that we are going to take it and they are not fully baked at this time. So it\u2019s really kind of hard to discuss the absolute magnitude of it at this moment. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then my other question is when you look at the supply contracts across your businesses with the new beer business and the scale it brings to the company, you mentioned you haven\u2019t worked on glass contracts yet and that\u2019s an opportunity going forward, have you looked at any other supply contracts and has progress been made in kind of garnering savings given the new scale of the business? Bob Ryder : Yes, number one, we didn\u2019t say we haven\u2019t or if we did say, we said it incorrectly. We have been working on glass and we have been working on other commodities. We are not at a stage yet where we are prepared to say exactly what our strategy is on glass. But it is something that we are working on. And yes we are working on the other commodities as well. And I would say the most we are prepared to say at the current time is I think that where we end up on commodities is going to be favorable. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : And should we expect to see those (resources) this year? Bob Ryder : That\u2019s what we think. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, right and should we expect to see those from a timeline perspective this year or is that\u2026? Bob Ryder : Sure. We will have something to say. I am sure we will have something to say on commodities as we go out, go through the year. Yes. Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities : Alright, I appreciate your time. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bob Ryder : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. So I am just going to give you a couple of quick kind of questions, some housekeeping items and then just one related to wine pricing. First just Bob if you could talk about just what the cash tax rate was for the year and what you expect it to be next year? Bob Ryder : Yes, so the cash tax rate for the year is kind of anomalous, so let me kind of walk you through. What we have said, we haven\u2019t updated this guidance in a while, but we would expect a cash tax rate like the mid 20% on an ongoing basis. I would say that the beer structure will probably improve on that over the medium to long-term, and we will update you on that when things settle down. I would say that fiscal \u201814 and actually fiscal \u201815 as well are going to be pretty anomalous because of the big increase in the stock price and some option exercises from options that were expiring, etcetera or people that are just exercising some in the money, we get a tax deduction for that and that\u2019s actually a reasonably big number, right. If you look at the cash flow statement, you can see the cash we brought in from option exercises. So that will bring the cash tax rate down, relatively dramatically while this situation goes on. We don\u2019t expect it to last big time past fiscal \u201815. So I would call that not really an operating cash tax environment. It\u2019s just that \u2013 the anomalous equity activity. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : But it will be a little better. It will be favorable in \u201815 relative to sort of what your normal run rate ought to be going forward? Bob Ryder : Yes, I would agree with that. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Okay, foreign exchange, just the peso-dollar exchange rate, and what \u2013 how should we think about that from a transaction translation impact for next year, or this year I should say? Rob Sands : Sorry, go ahead and finish your question. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : I was going to say for \u201815. Bob Ryder : Yes. So the way we handle this and actually \u2013 and we told you this on previous calls, the peso-dollar rate was more favorable than we thought because actually the rate physically has gotten favorable from when we closed the deal. We do hedge transaction exposure to the peso. There isn\u2019t actually as much peso exposure as you would think, because most of the commodities in the beer industry are dollar-based. So, really the core peso exposure is our onsite labor at the facility which still is a sizable number, but nowhere near what you would think. And we do have hedge contracts, we go out two or three years on those and we are actually relatively hedged for fiscal \u201815, right. So \u2013 and as I recall that I haven\u2019t looked at it in a while, but I think the peso dollar is around 13, right. So, we monitor closely and lay on hedges when they get more favorable, but we are not expecting a ton of volatility there in fiscal \u201815. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Okay. And then gross margins for the beer business in the fourth quarter and the full year, I know I think you disclosed that in the last couple of calls, are you going to \u2013 do you have that figure? Bob Ryder : Yes, I think I had it in my script. I think it said it was 44%. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Okay, alright. I must have missed it, sorry about that. And then just the last one\u2026 Bob Ryder : Please Bryan, I am exhausted man, come on. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : It\u2019s the lightning round. Bob Ryder : Exactly. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : The last one is just the wine pricing, Rob, if could you just characterize the decision to raise prices in wine both low end and in your premium wines, is it a function of your sort of assessment of the market, especially at the low end, where there has been quite a bit of pricing the last couple of years and so you feel comfortable with the pricing dynamic or the competitive activity sort of make you feel comfortable about taking prices up, is it a \u2013 or is it a question or a function of kind of now that you have made some marketing investments, new products investments you feel more comfortable raising prices behind that or is it have some effect on what you think sort of commodity cost or raw material cost might be in the future? Just trying to understand the motivation to take prices? Rob Sands : So yes, yes and no. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Okay. Rob Sands : So, yes, our assessment of the marketplace and so on and so forth is the fact that we do feel pretty well positioned given our previous investments and where we are relative to momentum in brand health that the timing is right and it\u2019s no, it\u2019s really not related to commodity, not related to commodity cost, although from a commodity cost perspective just kind of the opposite we have. We are not facing any particular headwinds this year in wine. So we are not expecting much inflation in cost of goods sold. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Okay. Rob Sands : So that will be helpful to us from a bottom line perspective. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America : Alright, thank you very much and thanks for being so generous with your time. Rob Sands : Our pleasure. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. As Bob mentioned, the beer deal has been a real game-changer for us and the team plans to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway to continue to drive the growth, enhance financial performance of the business. As Bob said, we now expect the beer business to exceed our original expectations from a return on invested capital point of view. And I believe that our plans for fiscal 2015 prove that we have not wavered from our overarching strategic goal of generating profitable organic growth across all of our businesses, including our wine and spirits businesses. We have recently posted two videos on our website that provides nice views of the Nava brewery. I encourage you to take a look when you have a few moments. Thank you everybody for your participation today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands\u2019 fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jackie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Our beer business is on fire. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year. And we continued to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery expansion. We have recently celebrated the one year anniversary of our game changing beer acquisition and I believe that our strong financial and operational performance during this time is a living testament to the significant contributions that our beer business is making to our overall sales profit and cash flow results. In the first quarter, the beer segment generated results that were better than our expectations for both the commercial business and our brewery in Mexico. Beer net sales increased double-digits to 14%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers, which is being driven by a combination of strong sales execution and excellent support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing and advertising programs, which are resonating with consumers, continued distribution gains across the portfolio and the further expansion of new product offerings like Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft, which continued to exceed our initial growth forecast. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. As such, we now expect beer depletions in fiscal 2015 to increase high single-digits, which should drive sales growth in the 10% range with underlying operating profits for the beer segment expected to increase in the mid-teen range. At this time, we believe we will have adequate supply to meet these sales goals for the year. I would like to remind everyone that the five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. Now, Corona Extra is the only top five U.S. beer brands in IRI channels that posted dollar share growth during the first quarter. In addition, the brand grew depletions of more than 3% and accounted for 10% of U.S. beer category dollar growth. As you know, Corona Light is the number one imported light brand in the U.S. with a 55% IRI dollar share of the import light category and increased dollar share by almost 2 share points during the quarter. Modelo Especial recently achieved yet another milestone as it moved up into the number two slot as the second largest imported U.S. beer brand on a volume basis in IRI channels, while also gaining distribution and 40 basis points of dollar share during the first quarter. And Pacifico and Negra Modelo each grew IRI dollar sales in the high single-digit range during the first quarter. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format driven by the market expansion of Corona Light in the first quarter. As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we continued to build our Corona de Mayo equity to assert Corona\u2019s ownership over summer\u2019s first fiesta in an effort to maintain momentum and keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kicked off a 120 Days of Summer. During the first quarter, initiatives included the national TV debut of the new Corona Extra 2014 television spots for general market and Hispanic consumers, the introduction of the Fill your Summer program, which is our first ever multicultural, bilingual summer program consisting of 18 weekly themes with activities, new contents and prize drawings. Promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships launched leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and ESPN coverage of the NFL draft. The national TV advertising for Corona Light designed for sports and cable entertainment TV debuted in the first quarter for the key summer selling season. New ads for Modelo Especial\u2019s Hispanic Real World campaign were introduced using general market media and strong support in targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming. The Modelo Especial summer soccer promotion kicked off in May featuring a summer promotion that includes a sweepstakes and a campaign designed to engage consumers at all touch points. A national launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began in April, expanding outside of initial introductory states. This initiative is supported by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. Now, from a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion including a new brewhouse, packaging area and warehouse are well underway. In many areas, crews are working around the clock. And as of last week over 1,200 craftsmen and construction workers were onsite. The first six fermentation tanks were recently hoisted into place and the massive concrete pour for the high density warehouse is progressing quickly. Great care is being taken so that construction work does not disrupt existing brewery operations. In fact their brewery produced a record number of cases in May. We continue to work diligently to finalize our future plans for commodity sourcing on items such as glass as well as assessing options for longer term capacity expansion beyond the 20 million hectoliter expansion that is already underway at the Nava brewery. We will certainly inform you as soon as these plans have been finalized. From a wine and spirits perspective during the first quarter the business performed generally as expected with sales results impacted by the planned distributor inventory destocking. The agreed upon make whole payment associated with this activity benefited gross profit margins for the quarter. First quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our fiscal year in February when we posted depletion trends of more than 5%. In addition, quarterly depletions were impacted by some retail inventory destocking. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress through the year similar to last year. Overall, we remained committed to growing in line with the U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2015 and beyond. As such during the first quarter we gained market share in IRI channels and experienced excellent performance for a number of our Focus Brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. As outlined earlier this year one of key strategic objectives for the year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Some of the initiatives recently executed that support this goal include the following. Increased TV advertising for specific Focus Brands including Woodbridge, Black Box and Robert Mondavi private selection, enhanced digital and print advertising as well as in-store programming for key brands like Clos du Bois Rouge and Estancia. And finally Dreaming Tree 360 degree activation programs that have begun in conjunction with Dave Matthews\u2019 summer concert tour. We are reaping the benefits of some of these key marketing and promotional initiatives as we continued to be recognized by industry leading publications for our new products and our Focus Brands. The most recent noteworthy accolades include the following. Earlier this week the drinks business and intangible business published their 2014 power brands lists Robert Mondavi was named the number three most powerful brand in the world, moving up from the number four spot last year. The Beverage Information Group recently announced their 2014 growth brand award winners with 13 Constellation brands receiving awards, including Kim Crawford, The Dreaming Tree, Mark West, Black Box, Estancia, Ruffino, Woodbridge, SVEDKA and Rex Goliath. In the April issue of Wines and Spirits magazine the 2011 Robert Mondavi, Napa Valley, Pinot Noir received 92 point score and the Best Buy designation, it was also included in the year\u2019s best Pinot Noir feature. Constellation Wines claimed four spots in this year\u2019s wine and spirits restaurant top 50 list, which is the survey of top-selling wines at America\u2019s favorite restaurants and included Franciscan, Simi, Robert Mondavi and Ruffino. And one of our other key strategic initiatives for the year relates to our drive to deliver margin accretive innovation and new products. Some of the recent activities that we have underway include the national expansion of wine on tap which includes varietals from brands like Simi, Franciscan, Mark West and Clos du Bois. The line extension introductions of the (indiscernible) Red Blend, Rex Goliath Sangria and Black Box Pinot Noir, the launch of Arbor Mist Sangria Rita, which capitalizes on the growing popularity of spirit style sangria and margarita cocktails and after a successful trial period at a major retail chain, PopCrush is expanding into national distribution. As we have previously discussed, we also continue to look for opportunities to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. One of our new initiatives includes the Corona and Rosatello brands, which have teamed up to develop a joint bilingual point-of-sale creative platform and consumer offer to drive display during the key summer selling season targeting California general market and Hispanic chains and independent retailers. Now, from a spirits perspective, while spirits net sales declined in the first quarter due to the timing of shipments, depletions grew in the low single-digit range. During the quarter, we launched SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA\u2019s flavor lineup as we continued to capitalize on the growth of flavored vodka. This activity is being supported by digital and billboard advertising and is being well received in the marketplace. We also reintroduced the new SVEDKA Stars & Stripes in advance of the Memorial Day holiday, which has become a very popular consumer item. In closing, solid execution of first quarter results demonstrates that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. And I am excited about our prospects for the business for the remainder of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results. Bob Ryder : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS in Q1 came in at $1.07, which represents a sizable increase versus last year. Q1 included some expected material activities in both of our businesses. In beer, we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the Q2 fiscal \u201814 beer business acquisition, which has significantly enhanced our financial and strategic profile. Sticking to beer, our Q1 financial performance and continued robust marketplace momentum drove the upward revision to our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance. Turning to wine and spirits, sales were impacted by our previously announced distributor inventory reduction. Also as announced, this reduction did not impact EBIT as demonstrated by the strong Q1 segment EBIT growth. Some of this growth is timing related and we expect a good portion of this favorability to reverse in Q2. Our full year financial sales and EBIT goals for wine and spirits remain on track. Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at Q1 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for Q1 included $868 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. For Q1, beer segment net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 11%. Depletions were also very strong growing 8%. It\u2019s typical to see distributor inventory build during our first quarter as we head into our strongest selling period for the year in beer. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis decreased 1%. This reflected a shipment volume decrease of 4% primarily resulting from a planned distributor inventory destocking partially offset by a make whole payment from the distributor associated with the destocking as well as favorable product mix. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $420 million and our consolidated gross margin was 44% versus 38% for the prior year first quarter. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $410 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 47%. The increase in our consolidated gross margin primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the higher margin beer business, the distributor payment associated with the inventory reduction and favorable wine and spirit product mix. SG&A for the quarter increased $119 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $123 million, the majority of which is marketing. This was offset by lower wine and spirits SG&A which was primarily driven by timing of compensation related expense. Q1 consolidated operating income increased $301 million. $288 million of the increase was related to the consolidation of the beer results with the beer segment generating an operating margin of 33% for the quarter. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 11 percentage point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Wine and spirits also contributed to the margin favorability as this segment reported a three percentage point improvement in operating margin due to the factors mentioned earlier. Roughly speaking the distributor make whole payment, positive operating \u2013 positive product mix and the timing of SG&A contributed equal thirds to the operating margin upside. Due to the timing of the beer business acquisition we did not record \u2013 recognize any equity earnings from Crown during the first quarter. For the prior year first quarter equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, up 58% versus Q1 last year. The increase represents an increase in average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of May, our total debt was $7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.8 billion, a decrease of $140 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The decrease primarily reflects our free cash flow generation. In early June we made $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. This was funded through a combination of cash on hand and revolving credit facilities. I would also like to remind you that we have $500 million 8.38 senior note coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32.5%, which reflects the benefits from integrating the beer business and compares to a 36.2% rate for Q1 last year. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. Now, let\u2019s discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending. For the first quarter we generated $101 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $19 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $232 million versus $3 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental benefits from the beer business acquisition. CapEx for the quarter totaled $131 million compared to $22 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $85 million as brewery expansion activities continued to progress. For fiscal \u201815, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. This reflects operating cash flow that is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. And CapEx, that\u2019s projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million. As a reminder, our CapEx projection includes $450 million to $500 million for the beer business primarily related to expanding the brewery to 20 million hectoliters of capacity. Now, let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 outlook. As a result of the strong beer business performance, we are now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 per share versus our previous guidance of $3.95 to $4.15. For fiscal 2015, we are now targeting net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10%. Shipment and depletion volumes are now targeted to grow high single-digits and significantly outpaced the import category and the total beer industry. For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. As a reminder, our fiscal 2014 beer segment operating income totaled $773 million and included 100% of the U.S. beer commercial business operating income for the entire year and brewery profits from the date of the beer business acquisition. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid-teens range. From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that in Q2, we faced an easier comparison as shipment volume growth in Q2 last year was only 1%. Beer will be facing some more difficult comparisons in the second half of this year as shipment volume growth in the second half of last year was over 13%. For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal \u201815 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. As mentioned earlier, we expect some of the EBIT favorability in Q1 for wine to reverse in Q2 due to the timing of shipment activity. Our comparable basis guidance, excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Before we take your questions, I would like to note that we are off to a great start in fiscal 2015 as the beer business continues to generate strong marketplace and financial performance, the brewery expansion continues to progress and the wine and spirit business is on track to meet its goals for the year. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi - RBC: Yes, good morning everyone. Bob Ryder : Hey, Nik. Rob Sands : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi - RBC: Hey, so just two quick questions. On the wine price mix, can you just kind of explain was that all mix or is there any bit of pricing in there? And then just generally what\u2019s going on within the pricing environment within wine? And then the last question I guess this one is for you, Rob, given beer margins have been kind of in the 33% range the last couple of quarters, this is a seasonally high quarter in terms of expenses, just curious on kind of state of the union on the 30% to 35% target and kind of what you think about perhaps being at the upper end of that or even above that range over the next couple of years? Thanks. Bob Ryder : Sure. Let me just comment on price mix smaller and then I will let Rob do the industry, what\u2019s going on in the industry. So, for us for the quarter, I\u2019d say that the upside to margin was primarily mix. Pricing didn\u2019t have a big impact. I will let Rob talk about what\u2019s going on in pricing in general in the wine and spirits category. Rob Sands : Yes, I think we see \u2013 Nik, we see some pricing now occurring in wine and spirits. Still I would say in line primarily we see pricing in the lower end of the wine business and we see some pricing in the higher end. The middle remains I would say pretty competitive, so sort of that $8 to $15 range is where we still don\u2019t see a lot of pricing. But I would say as a general proposition the pricing environment in wine and spirits is a bit more favorable than it has been in the past. We have taken some pricing on select brands as Bob said the margin accretion in the first quarter is probably more due to mix than it is to pricing, but we do have some pricing on some of our larger brands especially in the premium category and in sub-premium and sparkling. So as I said generally a more favorable environment. Bob Ryder : Sure. Nik on the second, the beer margin question, so as you know, we just updated our guidance. We are expecting this year to have margin expansion in beer as the guidance reflects about 10% sales growth and mid-teens EBIT growth, right. So we expect the beer business to continue gaining margin. Last year for the three quarters that we owned the business, our operating profit margin was around 31%. This year we expect that to be around 32% right now. So we do see some expanding margins. Now your question was more along longer-term because we gave some guidance that when the brewery is completed that we should have margins in kind of a low to mid 30% range. And we have stuck with that guidance and there is still obviously a lot going on in the beer business that the breweries being build out as Rob said there is about 1,200 people on the ground down there going up to about 3,000 building out to 20 million hectoliters and we still are buying 40% of our finished goods from Anheuser-Busch and all of our raw materials from Anheuser-Busch. And as we said we are currently thinking about transitioning from Anheuser-Busch for the raw material perspective and we have some bids coming in from the global providers of glass, hops, barley, things like that. And most likely we will be discussing the transition from the Anheuser-Busch and how those bids came out in a general frame probably in this calendar year. So I think when that flushes out we might be able to give some more specific guidance about where we see longer term margins in beer. But we still don't have all those bids in, and we are not ready to talk about it to the outside world. Obviously, the big component of that is glass which we also aren\u2019t ready to talk about it to the outside world. There is a lot of discussions going in that arena. So long answer to right now we are still sticking to the low to mid single-digit operating profit margin for beer. Nik Modi - RBC: Alright. Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Rob Sands : Yes. Hi Alice. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Hi. Okay. So my question is a little bit more on the second quarter beer shipments and depletions, should I assume that shipments are up a little less or little weaker than depletions in the second quarter because you over shipped a little in the first quarter. And then the second part of that is what should we be looking for depletions in the second quarter, you talked about the easy comp and also we have got the World Cup and we have got weather that really just turned favorable over the Memorial Day weekend, so can you kind of go through that and breakout depletions in the second quarter and then shipments versus those? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes. We try not to get too specific on quarterly guidance and my gosh, you are asking very specific question, but that\u2019s okay. We do expect a very strong second quarter in beer for two reasons. We do have a lot of momentum in the marketplace as you see. And from a billings perspective, we have an easier overlap, I think it might be our easiest overlap of the year as I recall from last year, depletions were stronger than shipments last year. So, I think the depletion overlap is a little more difficult than the shipment overlap. But for the full year, we still expect shipments and depletions to be aligned for the beer business and there is a lot of this quarterly activity going on, but I would probably try to focus more on what\u2019s going on in the longer term and over the full year. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : I mean, is it likely that the second quarter depletions in volume terms will be similar to the first quarter? Bob Ryder : That\u2019s about all I am going to say about the quarterly guidance. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Okay. Then just I guess I will add one more question, if you look at your beer shipments in the first quarter, price looks like it was about 3%, it was 3.5% and yet I think we have been working with 2% for pricing for beer and I think your guidance for the year sort of assumes 2% pricing. So, can you comment on that 3%? Bob Ryder : Sure. In that number, Alice, is also some distributor \u2013 beer distributor contribution to some of our marketing campaigns, because we will sit down every year with the distributors. And if we have some ideas that we think are really going to drive volume and then the distributors agree that they will sometimes, they will contribute and that contribution comes across in the net sales what looks like pricing, but it\u2019s really not because that it\u2019s a zero some gain that comes into an expense that\u2019s further down on the P&L. So, I think from a pricing perspective, IRI just from price probably closer to like 2% versus 3%. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. I have got two questions relative to wine. I guess the first one maybe following up on Nik Modi\u2019s question about the price mix on wine, I think Bob, if you could just walk us through net sales on a constant currency basis for the wine and spirits segment was down 1% and our wine shipment volumes were down 3.8%. So, explaining that, I think that gap makes it look like there is more price mix maybe in wine, but I am assuming that the make whole payment is contributing to that. So, could you just sort of try to give us some sense for how much the make whole payment contributed? I think in total, it looks like it could be somewhere in the $15 million range, I am just trying to get a sense for the size of that? And then I have a second question. Bob Ryder : Yes. The make whole payment and you guys understand the math of it, right, so we are getting a payment against which there were no sales, right. So that really helps your margin. And for the quarter, the impact on math was probably between 75 and 100 bps for the quarter would be the impact on gross profit margin for that. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : But on the revenue growth, what would it be \u2013 so it would have been the same dollar amount on the revenues, seems like it\u2019s a credit that comes to the net sales line right? Bob Ryder : Yes, that is correct. It is a credit that comes through the net sales line, but it really \u2013 it\u2019s not based on revenue, it\u2019s based on EBIT, right. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Right. Bob Ryder : So it kind of brings down your net selling price per case, but it increases your gross profit margin, right. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s quasi-confusing, but what I will tell you is for the quarter, mix had a bigger impact than the make whole payment. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Got it. Bob Ryder : It is a very positive mix quarter versus prior year and I will tell you prior year was a very poor mix quarter. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s helpful. And then the second question just related to wine, Rob, there has been some speculation in the press about Treasury Wine Estates and the potential that it might be for sale and Constellation has been mentioned in that. And I obviously don\u2019t expect you to comment directly on that, but just conceptually kind of where you\u2019ve got, where you are thinking at this point in terms of M&A in wine and is it tuck-in, would you be open to doing something sort of more transformational, any comments around that would be helpful? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes. I mean, I think that as it relates to M&A, whether in wine or any other categories, our position remains the same, which is as to use of capital, our primary focus remains on debt pay down at the current time. As you mentioned, tuck-in deals meaning if a brand came around that, that was something that was really hot met our financial objectives, filled the niche that we didn\u2019t have. Of course, we would take a look at an opportunity like that, but generally, our strategy at the current time is all about driving organic growth and obviously we have got really good organic growth across all of the categories in the business. And there is a lot of upside and benefit to be gained through simple debt reduction following the beer acquisition. So, strategically, that\u2019s what really makes the most sense in terms of how we are operating the business at the current time. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Alright, thank you. Have a great holiday. Rob Sands : Thanks. You too. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Rob Sands : Hi, Bill. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Just one last one on the wine side, any kind of update on grape or input costs, maybe was there incremental inflation this quarter and are you still expecting kind of some relief as we move to the fall? Bob Ryder : Yes. The grape input costs for this fiscal year we are not going to see much inflation from that at all, because the higher cost grapes have pretty much flushed through the P&L. So, that\u2019s helping our wine EBIT growth for the year and helping us maintain the guidance of kind of flattish margins for the year. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: So, as we look out I mean could the tailwind get bigger as we move to the back half of the year? Bob Ryder : No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change that much. I don\u2019t think we will see a lot of noise in grape costs for the year. It\u2019s relatively flat. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then just on the tax, just to make sure, are you expecting it to be below 30% for one or all the quarters from here that you have to get back to that 30% for the full year? Bob Ryder : Yes, it will have to be below for some of them, just the math of it, right, because we are at like 32.5% this year. So, we are still sticking with the 30% for the full year, which would mean one or several quarters we will have to be below the 30%. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. So, but not just like a single quarter catch up, it will just be kind of even over the next three? Bob Ryder : It\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t really forecast it, because it\u2019s based on a lot of it\u2019s based on actions of third parties and we are not sure when the timing of it will happen. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then last can you just kind of walk us through if we look at the Nava plant, I mean, things that are being done to \u2013 as the margins are ramping up kind of in front of the expansion, what\u2019s helping to drive it beyond mix? I mean, what\u2019s \u2013 what can you do, what have you done with the plant since you have taken ownership that\u2019s kind of gives us excitement for the margins to expand between now and the finalization of the expansion? Bob Ryder : The expansion is going to be kind of a date specific thing, right and the thing that will drive the margin increase on the expansion, when the expansion is done, it\u2019s primarily freight. Okay, because right now, we are buying 40% of our goods from InBev and they are being sourced from hundreds of miles south of brewery, right. So we make them at the brewery, we\u2019ll have much lower freight, but then there is a lot of other moving parts like I mentioned earlier to Nik\u2019s question what\u2019s going to happen when we move to our own purchasing contracts versus buying from InBev, is that positive, negative or neutral? What\u2019s going to happen around glass, which of course is the big input cost in beer, packaging is roughly 50% at cost of sales. In beer, what we had experienced so far is an incredibly well run brewery. The people and the process that we inherited when we bought the Nava brewery we couldn\u2019t be happier with. I was just down there a week ago and the throughput on the brewery has surprised us on a positive perspective especially when you consider all of the stuff that\u2019s going on to double the size of the brewery, right. So that helped us, it was good because first quarter is one of the peak production quarters like you are trying to make as much as you can to fuel the peak summer selling season. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. Okay. Well, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Hi. Good morning guys. Rob Sands : Hi Mark. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : I guess two questions also beer related. Rob can you give us a little more perspective on specifically what\u2019s driving the incremental growth you are seeing with Especial and to what extent you are seeing ACV gains and to what extent it\u2019s coming from improvements in shelf space or velocity at existing accounts? And then I had a related beer question. Rob Sands : Yes, Mark. I mean it\u2019s a whole bunch of things. I mean it starts with the consumer and the consumer is voting with their feet. So, we had very strong consumer takeaway on the product and everything we are doing from a marketing perspective as it relates to the consumer is obviously really resonating with the consumer. And we go back to retail and wholesale and you get sort of a compounding infectiousness when you have a brand that\u2019s on fire with the consumer which really means that it\u2019s a mushrooming effect, right. And it\u2019s a cart and a horse question, in that the consumer is that the \u2013 the product resonates with the consumer, the consumer is demanding the product, the retailers sees that it\u2019s hot with the consumer. The retailer and the wholesaler then invests more resources whether it\u2019s manpower or dollars against the product which then circles back around and has the effect of even driving the products harder at retail. So fundamentally you sort of got the whole cycle working to the advantage of the brand. So it\u2019s really a whole combination effects that people got very strong marketing behind the brand as well as our other beer brands. And again that continues to resonate with the consumer. We are sending a very consistent message whether it\u2019s on Corona or Modelo Especial. Modelo Especial is a very, very well known brand in Mexico, therefore it is a brand that is well known and trusted by the Hispanic consumer in the United States that population demographic group is very strong in terms of purchasing power and growth at the current time. So, we are seeing all the benefits of that. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : That\u2019s for the ACV and same-store, is there \u2013 can you give us any perspective geographically on Especial at (indiscernible) with Hispanics and it\u2019s growing I think kind of across the country but can you give us some perspective on comparative rates of growth geographically? Rob Sands : Yes. We are actually seeing very strong growth in some of the most mature markets for Modelo Especial like Southern California where Modelo Especial has a share and its equal to or greater than Corona and we are continuing to see double-digit growth in some of these large markets. And then in some of the more developmental markets like in the East and so on and so forth, we are continuing to see the brand really starting to catch on and we are seeing strong growth in those markets too. So it\u2019s really across the board phenomenon and even in the mature markets we are seeing double-digit growth. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : That\u2019s great. And then I was hoping you could unpack this comment about having adequate supply for your demand this summer? And there is a lot out there in terms of how much there is a glass shortage and who it affects and how, but can you just kind of set the record straight, is there some depletion number in terms of rate of growth? Will you start having problems with glass supply or are you sitting here looking at the next three months and saying it\u2019s kind of a non-issue? Rob Sands : Yes, it\u2019s the latter. We are looking at the next three months and it\u2019s a non-issue. First of all on supply, what has occurred, there\u2019s been some very isolated circumstances on SKUs, not on brands, but on some particular SKUs in some markets we have seen some supply tightness in the marketplace. What\u2019s really driven that has nothing to do with anything related to the brewery or ABI or supply in general, it\u2019s merely a consequence of the fact that the brands are growing at a rate, which intrinsically it can be hard to keep up with. Therefore, in a particular market like there was some reports on Florida, there was some supply shortages there on a particular SKU, well, Publix is a gigantic chain down there, ran a great big promotion and ran itself and everybody else out of inventory, that would happen or can happen under any circumstances when you are talking about the kind of growth that we are experiencing at the current moment in time. It\u2019s frankly just difficult to supply and can be at the levels that we are talking about. Now, all that said, we think we have got the inventories within our own business at wholesale and at retail generally speaking that there should not be supply issues even with the growth that we are experiencing throughout the rest of the summer and of course we are planning for this growth. Now, as I said, on an individual SKU basis in an individual market depending on what promotions are being run by the retailers, which we don\u2019t necessarily have control over can something like that occur, yes, but we are not expecting anything of out of the ordinary in that respect. So, the supply situation is well in hand. We do not have a glass shortage. I don\u2019t know where that comes from either. We have got as a general proposition plenty of glass to supply the brand. And as I mentioned in my script, we are working on the glass strategy and we should be able to talk about that in the next few months. And I am sure we will see a favorable outcome there as well, so. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Great, great. Thanks very much, Rob. Rob Sands : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Rob Sands : Hi, Caroline. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Everyone, good morning. Congrats on the great results. Rob Sands : Thanks. Caroline Levy - CLSA: I was looking for some help with modeling the third quarter, because you had \u2013 I guess, Bob you had mentioned that shipments were up 13%, I don\u2019t know I have a little more than that in my model in the third quarter a year ago, but it\u2019s looking like that could be a down shipment year on quarter, a down shipment quarter. And I am just wondering if that\u2019s how you are modeling it, you are looking at that comp and saying yes, we should expect very little shipment growth and then what the implications are for margins in that quarter, if that happens? Bob Ryder : Yes. The statement I made was last year we experienced 13% growth in the back half. So that would have been Q3 and Q4 which were both strong quarters in beer last year, because they were subsequent to us becoming an independent beer company to the U.S. distributors. So, we have been saying that along we have much more difficult overlaps in beer in the back half and easier in the front half. And our easiest overlap in beer from a shipment perspective is the second quarter. Then when you look next year, Q3, Q4 were very strong for beer. Caroline Levy - CLSA: But again, the implications on margins could also come through in the back half because of that, I mean, shipments and margins would be strongly correlated, I take it? Bob Ryder : Yes, probably, but again from a full year perspective, right, what we are seeing is some pretty impressive numbers. We are saying we expect sales to be up about 10%. We are saying profits to be up almost 1.5 times that, right. So there will be margin expansion in any individual quarter. There can be anomalous activity and it\u2019s not as you know in every quarter you have anomalous activity in the previous year and the anomalous activity in the current year, so you can have some odd outcomes that\u2019s why I look \u2013 like to look at full year or even year-to-date as you get more data in your margin analysis. So that\u2019s how we see things playing out. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask about A&M spending, I guess last year your ad spending was about $280 million, could you help us just quantify how much your spending is going up and if that\u2019s timed particularly on beer around summer, so most of it\u2019s going to happen before the back half? Rob Sands : Yes. So marketing spend will go up this year versus last year. And in fact we expect it to be a higher percentage of sales as well. And we expect to spend most of it in the peak summer season. We are just spending a decent amount of marketing in the first quarter. And because as we have made a conscious efforts to kind of do our media flights around when the consumer is drinking a lot of beer, right in the summer. And as Rob discussed, we have put some money behind World Cup, put some money behind boxing and we put a decent amount of money to work against major league baseball. So, we do expect marketing to go up this year both in absolute dollars. And as a percentage of sales, I would say roughly speaking, we would expect to spend between 8% to 9% of sales on marketing for the full year. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you. One more question if I may on Corona Light, do you have any anecdotal actual numbers to share with us on how that push is going on premise and how the brand is doing in markets where you really to get that brewer activity? Rob Sands : Yes. So we \u2013 as you said we have made a concerted effort to push Corona Light through the draft \u2013 through draft which through the on-premise and that\u2019s going very well. The consumer is really resonate with the product because it has much higher taste than other light beers, but still has the low alcohol, obviously they have recognized the brand and the retailers will ask pub owners really like it because it\u2019s a higher ring for them right, it\u2019s more expensive core than say a premium light. So that actually \u2013 that strategy is going as good or better than we anticipated. And it\u2019s probably not statistically valid yet, but we also feel that in the markets where we are driving Corona Light we also sell more cases of Corona Light. So we believe that that will go very well. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Great. Thank you very much. As you look at your beer sales can you kind of breakout to the best you can where you see the surprise coming from, is it particular brands, SKUs, areas. And also do you have any data or any information from your guys suggesting where your share gains are coming from is it coming from mainstream light beers, premium beers, any particular brands or is it from some of the Heineken\u2019s Mexican beers, just kind of a sense of where the share gains are coming from please? And then as a follow-up perhaps you could address any plans you may be making now to address the planned launch of Montego yet later in the year? Rob Sands : Yes. I would say Robert that we are really happy with our growth throughout the country. Now, what I will tell you is that we are doing better in the West Coast as Rob said Modelo Especial is doing a great job growing in markets where it\u2019s highly penetrated already. So our best geographies on a growth wise are the West and the South. But we are really happy with our growth around the country and we are pretty much gaining share in every space. I\u2019d say that every one of our brands is growing versus prior year. I\u2019d say that Corona, which is very well distributed, continues to grow quite nicely. In the first quarter, it put up some good numbers. Depletion growth was in the low single-digits. Shipment growth was higher than that, because we had that inventory replenishment. And Modelo Especial continues to grow in the mid single-digits. So, it\u2019s really all going quite well. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: But is the growth coming from other imports like Heineken, is it coming from Coors, Miller, Bud, or is it kind of all of the above? Rob Sands : Yes, Robert, this is Rob. I would say that it\u2019s really kind of across the board. It\u2019s kind of hard to say exactly where the share gains are being sourced from, but you can look at our growth and our brands versus pretty much any of the other categories within beer probably with the exception of craft. So, it\u2019s across the board sort of phenomena. And I\u2019d say that if you look at the industry overall, you\u2019ve got Constellation beer, right, which is about the same size as craft and you have got a craft of the whole category, which is about the same size as our beer business. And those two segments are I would say taking share just generally across the board. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: That\u2019s very clear. And as you think about the expected launch of Montego this fall, anything that you are hearing about that and how are you thinking about preparing your brand strategy and marketing to combat that? Rob Sands : So, I would say, a couple of things in that regard. First of all, there has been a lot of launches by a lot of companies over the years. And in the recent past and in the distant past of brands that were designed to compete with our portfolio, right. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Yes. Rob Sands : You can think of brands like \u2013 you can remember all kinds of attempts. And again, our brands are extremely well established with the consumer. So, I would say we don\u2019t fear competition particularly. And we have seen examples of it many times and we just kind of stick to our knitting and drive our business the way we have been driving in the past which has been a particularly good strategy. Now as it relates to Montego, first of all, it\u2019s not an established brand in Mexico, it\u2019s not known to the Mexican or the Hispanic consumer, it\u2019s just another brand basically. So, it doesn\u2019t pose any particular threat to us that it\u2019s different than anything else that has been done by any of our competitors in the past. On another note much sort of like the clustered theory of fast food restaurants, why do they all build on the same corner, hopefully, if it experiences some success, it will expand the category for everybody. So, I think it could actually have a positive impact on driving sort of the whole Mexican import category should it be, should it gain any success at all. So, again, we are just not \u2013 we are not particularly fussed by one company introducing one brand that might theoretically compete with some of our brands. So, that\u2019s sort of the bottom line. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Great. And then just in terms of the upside to your expectations and original budgeting, is that more in Corona Extra and Modelo Especial and any particular SKUs just trying to get a sense where you are doing better than you had expected? Rob Sands : Yes. Our business is a general proposition, which means all of our beer brands are growing at a faster rate than we would have predicted prior to the beginning of the year. And as I have said in the past this is with the kind of growth that we are experiencing it is difficult to predict if it\u2019s hard to make forecast and to give guidance and to remain reasonable given the market at the same time. So you got to balance all those things. We can\u2019t just make up crazy numbers, so we try to come up with what we think are reasonable numbers. And then in our own internal planning we also made sure that we plan for the contingency that the business will grow faster than we expect because it\u2019s really little downside in doing that. So don\u2019t confuse, our guidance and our forecasting and our attempt to be reasonable given sort of where the market is with what we are doing from a capacity perspective to ensure that we have sufficient supplies to meet market demand, so two different things. Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Okay great. Thank you very much. Rob Sands : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Rob Sands : Hi John. John Faucher - JPMorgan: Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to ask one quick question, well I guess two quick questions about the guidance. The first is if we look at the order of magnitude of the upside for this quarter not a whole lot extra flowing through, just any comments on that in terms of why the rest of the year maybe isn\u2019t going up a little bit more. And then a clarification on the free cash flow guidance which stated the same, is it simply that with the sales coming in better, higher receivables, higher inventories what have you \u2013 is it working capital that\u2019s offsetting the higher net income on the free cash flow guidance? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes. So I will let Bob answer the free cash flow. On the guidance for the year as Bob said a number of times second half of the year we are overlapping 13% growth I mean it\u2019s sort of simple as that. Again we are back to the point I was just previously making which is we can only sort of forecast reasonable numbers and our guidance is based on that and we have a pretty significant overlap in the second half of the year. And we had some pretty easy comps in the first half of the year. So yes, we grew 14% in sales in the first quarter and that was a good result and we are very pleased with that. And as Bob said we expect probably from a sales perspective a pretty strong second quarter because we had a very low sales month \u2013 quarter in the second quarter last year with 1% growth and then we overlapped the 13% growth in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s what it translates for the whole year into the low-single digit growth of sales that we have been \u2013 that is included in our guidance. So I would sort of like the fact that we can do at the current moment relative to our guidance for the year. But your crystal ball is as good as ours in many respects. Bob Ryder : John on the free cash flow it\u2019s the first quarter alright and even if you flow through the after tax impacts of our increased if you call EBIT guidance, we are still within the range that we provided for the full year. So we feel it was worth readdressing it. And we will be readdressing it as the year goes on. But we thought it\u2019s only the first quarter, so let\u2019s see how the year comes out and we are still within the free cash flow range. John Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay, thanks. And then one clarification that the wine benefit having you guys said that was 75 to 100 basis points and that\u2019s a total company gross margin is that right, that\u2019s how we should back into that number? Rob Sands : It\u2019s just still wine gross margin. John Faucher - JPMorgan: It\u2019s wine gross margin. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gallant with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one, how are you planning to address your debt that\u2019s coming due this year? Do you think you will have to approach the market for that? Bob Ryder : Yes, we can\u2019t wait to payoff that 8 3/8% note. So, we currently have the flexibility, we are in good position to do what we want to, right. We can use our revolver, which would give us very positive arbitrage, because our securitization facilities are LIBOR plus 90 and the revolver is LIBOR plus 175, which is quite a bit less than the 8 3/8% notes, right or I think we can do this at any point in the year, right, if we would like to secure some longer term financing albeit at a higher rate than the securitization or the revolver. We could also do that. So, we are kind of keeping our powder dry around that to see how the markets behave, how rates are, and how we feel our future free cash flow needs will be. Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC. Lauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on beer and specifically the Corona brand, I think in one of your responses to a question you said that depletions of the Corona brand were up low single-digits in the quarter, just curious to get your perspective on the pricing or the ability to price on this brand, it seems like there hasn\u2019t been aggressive pricing or at least there has been some pullback in pricing. So, I was just trying to get the correlation here, if you feel there is more room on pricing on the Corona brand, do you think that low single-digit growth rate is still achievable or you feel is pricing on that brand, you can\u2019t press it that hard that you will see some pushback on the volume side? Rob Sands : Yes, I mean, first of all, where we priced for this year is sort of fairly well-known in that low single-digit range of around 2%. And then as far as our pricing trends go for the future, it\u2019s really a function of what occurs in the marketplace, which obviously we watch very carefully and what occurs on a market-by-market basis. So, right now, I would say it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on what will happen relative to our pricing in the future, because we simply don\u2019t know what is going to occur in the rest of the markets. So, we will have to wait and see. We take a very strategic position relative to pricing. We do it market-by-market, brand-by-brand. And we do it largely on a reactive basis. So, we will see what happens. We can\u2019t really tell you right now. Lauren Torres - HSBC: But Rob, what are you seeing now though, I mean from a competitive standpoint, is there within the import category and who you consider your peers, has there been very little or no pricing in the category? Rob Sands : No. I would say that you can look in the category, you can look in IRI, and there has been about low single-digit pricing. That\u2019s been the case. There has no suggestion of anything other than that. Bob Ryder : It\u2019s been the case for two or three years. Rob Sands : Right. Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. Rob Sands : So, we don\u2019t see anything different right now. Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. So, that\u2019s more or less sustainable rate of pricing you see going forward? Rob Sands : Well, we are not commenting on the sustainability of anything going forward. As I said, we judge that more on a real-time basis. So, don\u2019t know. Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay, alright. Understood. Thanks. Rob Sands : Thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Good morning guys. Two questions. The first getting back to the planning question, I mean, given the fact that you guys are guiding to high single-digits depletions growth, I mean it would appear that if you kind of trace this forward, you guys \u2013 when you guys open the additional capacity on a brewery that you are going to be close to that capacity given the trends we are seeing in the market. So, what I guess other things are you thinking about in order to make sure that you have the capacity to fulfill the market as we get three years out or so? Rob Sands : Yes. Like any business that\u2019s growing at the rate that we are growing, well, we will have to be capacity planning well in advance of the growth to ensure that we have the capacity that\u2019s necessary to meet the market demand. So that\u2019s what we are going to do. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Okay, alright. And then a modeling question on the wine business, I mean did you guys expect depletions to be down 2%. And I guess what I am trying to drive out is if I back out shipments relative to depletions, it would seem that shipments trail depletions by 300,000 cases or so. I mean is that the level of inventory you were expecting or the inventory reduction that you were expecting? Bob Ryder : Shipments and depletions were about the same number for the quarter, but when you look at growth, it gets odd, because then your year-over-year, but it was very \u2013 it was somewhat of a confusing quarter for wine because of the prior year shipment depletion, prior year mix compared to this year\u2019s mix and the reduction in distributor inventory. So, I don\u2019t blame you for scratching your head a little bit on that, but for the full year shipments will equal depletions for the wine category and there might be some quarterly ups and downs as the distributors do what they have to do to move the product. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : So, depletions and shipments will match despite the fact that there was a wholesaler or whatever, wholesaler that reduced inventory, is that right? Bob Ryder : No, it\u2019s just for the full year it won\u2019t be all that material to the shipments depletions, right. For the quarter, it was, but for the full year, it won\u2019t be. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : And then so it\u2019s fair to assume that for the next three quarters or the last three quarters of the year, the numbers for shipments and depletions should be roughly in line, is that fair? Bob Ryder : No. What I will say is I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen for quarter, but I can tell you for the full year, shipments will pretty much equal depletions. Now, to your point, the distributor inventory reduction obviously, they continued to deplete, but we didn\u2019t shift right, which was material for the quarter, but it won\u2019t be that noticeable for the full year. And the quarter numbers can get a little anomalous, because you just have third-parties doing what they have to do to fill consumer demand. Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research : Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : And that was our final question. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Yes, thanks everyone for joining our call today. We are really pleased with our quarterly results and we have had a great start to the year. The team plans to continue to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway in the beer business to drive growth and enhanced financial performance. From a wine and spirits perspective, we are gaining traction and are on track to achieve our goals for the year. And I hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars & Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So again, thank you everybody for participating in our call today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Constellation Brands\u2019 Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s conference call. In addition to our second quarter fiscal 2015 results and outlook, we will also discuss our glass sourcing strategy and incremental brewery expansion. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our two news releases, which have also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert Sands : Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of our second quarter financial results, as well as other important events that will shape the strategic direction of our company going forward. It has certainly been an exciting few months at Constellation. Since last quarter, we announced the acquisition of the Casa Noble tequila brand, an award-winning handcrafted super premium tequila which will be a great addition to our portfolio. Adding Casa Noble to our portfolio is important because tequila and Mexican beer share similar target consumers and drinking occasions both on and off premise. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. Now during the quarter, we were challenged by a Corona Extra product recall, which was caused by defects in glass models caused by a production error at a glass plant run by one of our glass suppliers. I\u2019m very proud of the dedication and hard work of our employees, distributors and retailers who have worked tirelessly and diligently to remove potentially affected product from our retail and distribution system. While the recall impacted our financial results slightly for the quarter, we expect to replenish second quarter loss sales in the third quarter and we are currently working with our glass supplier to recover the costs of the recall. We announced this morning that we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery in Mexico that will expand production capacity of that facility to 25 million hectoliters by the end of calendar year 2017. This project is being driven by the exceptional portfolio momentum of our beer business, which has significantly outperformed the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. Lastly, we are pleased to announce that we are in the process of finalizing the long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players. The multi-faceted approach of this strategy includes the following components. We have agreed to purchase from ABI their state-of-the-art glass plant in Nava, Mexico, which is located adjacent to our brewery in that location. While this facility currently has one operational furnace, we plan to initially scale it to four furnaces, which will ultimately be able to supply us with more than 50% of our glass requirements. This transaction also includes the purchase of a high-density warehouse, land and well infrastructure and is subject to U.S. Department of Justice and Mexican regulatory approvals both of which we expect to receive by the end of this calendar year. We have also agreed to enter into a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate the glass plant that we are purchasing from ABI. As the world\u2019s leading glass producer, O-I has more than a 100 years of experience in producing glass containers. They have built and expanded dozens of plants and participate in joint ventures in several different countries throughout the world. We also currently use O-I as a glass supplier for our wine business. O-I will primarily have responsibilities for plant operations including purchasing, technical services and the plant expansion. O-I is also expected to become a secondary glass supplier outside of the joint venture arrangement. The final piece of the strategy, we have entered into a long-term seven-year supply agreement with Vitro who is a (inaudible) leader in glass manufacturing in Mexico and we will expect \u2013 we\u2019ll ultimately supply 25% to 30% of the glass needs for our beer business. Overall, this sourcing strategy provides the best outcome in terms of quality, flexibility, cost effectiveness and control for this critical area of our beer production. Now because it will take some time for the glass plant to become fully operational at optimal capacity, we will continue to work with ABI to purchase glass supply needed for production at the Nava brewery under our existing Transition Services Agreement through mid calendar year 2015. In addition, we plan to continue to procure finished product from ABI under our Interim Supply Agreement until the initial Nava expansion to 20 million hectoliters is complete in calendar 2016. Overall, our additional investments in production capacity and glass sourcing are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the marketplace for our beer portfolio well into the future. Our second quarter beer results are a testament to this portfolio momentum, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% and posted the 18th consecutive quarter of market share gains for our U.S. beer business. This level of growth for Constellation\u2019s beer business represents the most significant contribution to total U.S. beer dollar growth in IRI channels across all suppliers during our second quarter. These results were driven by Corona Extra\u2019s momentum of increased media support during the summer as well as the success of our Fill your Summer advertising campaign that was our first-ever multicultural, bilingual summer program. In IRI metric channels, Corona Extra continues to gain share and is currently the number five beer brand in the U.S. market. In addition, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial teamed up this year a broadcast sponsorship of World Cup games on Spanish language TV. Modelo Especial Hispanic Real World campaign helped to propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail dollar takeaway trends in IRI channels of more than 30% during the quarter. In addition, Modelo Especial\u2019s summer soccer sweepstakes promotion surpassed all sales and consumer engagement targets set for this initiative. Modelo Especial Chelada has already become the number seven Mexican import brand in less than a year since launch. The growth of this product is being driven by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR events in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. Lastly, the draft beer format continues to have significant momentum achieving sales growth of more than 40% during the quarter driven by the continued market expansion of Corona Light. The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio all experienced growth in the quarter and are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway and preceding on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Key performance metrics are being achieved with no disruption to existing brewery operations. In many areas, crews are working around the clock. In fact, the brewery recently achieved record capacity utilization with a record number of cases produced and shift in August. Brewery tank fabrication and installation are being completed on schedule and the packaging building is tracking the plan with steel erection in process. A new line was recently installed which is one of the largest in the world and the first beer run from this line is expected to come in coming weeks. From a wine and spirits perspective, the business performed well during the second quarter with depletions improving sequentially as expected. The depletion growth in the quarter was driven by excellent performance by a number of our fast-growing brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. Our expectation is that you should continue to see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the year similar to last year. As we head into our key holiday selling season in the second half of the year, we will be executing programming to ensure that we drive growth for our key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and the greatest growth potential. We are well positioned to achieve this goal with initiatives that include the launch of our first-ever holiday TV advertising for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. After the success of last year\u2019s combined Corona, Woodbridge, Butterball turkey promotion, we will once again repeat this program in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday. We have committed to incremental feature and display activity on several margin accretive brands including Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Rosatello and we have dedicated more sales focus on the roots to market for our spirits business now that we have Casa Noble tequila as part of the portfolio. During the second quarter, we received several awards for some of our key brands. Some of the most noteworthy accolades include the Leaders\u2019 Choice Award which recently saluted the industry\u2019s hottest new product in wine and spirits by awarding the best new wine product to honor our Thorny Rose brand. Wines across the Constellation portfolio earned a total of 47 medals at the 2014 San Francisco International Wine Competition including double gold and 98 point score for the 2011 Clos du Bois milestone. In addition, gold medals were awarded for the 2013 Woodbridge Chardonnay, 2012 Ruffino Chianti, 2012 Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Cabernet Sauvignon and the 2012 Robert Mondavi Coastal Crush. We are also proud to receive a 90 point score from both the Wine Spectator and wine and spirits for some of our well known wines including Robert Mondavi 2012 Oakville Fume Blanc and the 2010 Mount Veeder Reserve and the Franciscan Estate Magnificat. Now from a spirits perspective, we experienced strong sales growth in our spirits business during the second quarter driven by the recent launch of new flavor line extensions across our portfolio including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy peach flavor. As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relating to the California grape harvest, which is currently underway running nearly a month ahead of last year with more than 70% complete at this time. The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of 3.8 million to 4 million tons versus approximately 4.4 million tons last year. The quality of this year\u2019s harvest looks to be very good if not excellent. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to be flat to down slightly compared to last year depending on the variety, location and demand. Before I close, I would like to take a minute to discuss our assessment of the impact of the recent California earthquake that occurred near Napa. We have assessed the extent of the earthquake\u2019s impact on our operations and we are very fortunate that the impact is minor. Most importantly, we are relieved that our employees and their families are safe as the earthquake occurred overnight when our facilities were closed. While there was minor damage inside some of our northern California wineries, none of them have sustained structural damage and our vineyards have not been impacted. In closing, we are excited about the favorable outcome of our glass sourcing strategy as we look forward to working with our excellent supply partners as they support our efforts to build upon our leading, important beer position in the U.S. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. And within our wine and spirits business, we are well positioned to drive our grape portfolio brands during the upcoming holiday season. I now would like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results. Robert Ryder : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot of significant good news to talk about today both for the quarter and the longer term. First off, we continue to deliver beer sales that greatly outpace the industry. And despite the glass recall, we are affirming full year beer guidance. In addition, we are providing medium-term volume guidance that also outpaces our estimate of the total beer industry growth. We believe we have good portfolio and demographic evidence to support our projections. We\u2019ve also completed a comprehensive year long glass sourcing strategy project. The outcome of these efforts are expected to provide Constellation a continual and diversified source of beer, glass supply from leading industry providers at a cost lower than that we currently pay today. We\u2019re also increasing our medium-term operating target for beer which indicates considerable margin upside from our fiscal '15 year-to-date run rate of 32%. As a result of these factors, we foresee a continuation of a fast-growing top line and an increase to our already healthy beer profit margin. Finally, we will discuss increased capital spending in brewery and glass capacity to support the robust growth we are targeting. This represents investments with very high returns as the beer segment enjoys strong and growing margins and quite a high operating ROIC. I\u2019ll provide more details on the longer term items just highlighted, but now let\u2019s start looking at our second quarter results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $1.11, a 16% increase versus Q2 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Depletions were essentially not impacted by the recall, as wholesalers worked to replenish supply at retailers before the end of Q2 from their existing inventory levels. However, the recall impacted our sales as we reversed shipments to wholesalers for approximately 2 million cases of Corona Extra. This translated into a reduction of approximately 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. This reduction is reflected in the $1.11 Q2 EPS. We expect to replenish this volume with shipments to wholesalers primarily during the third quarter, as we work to bring wholesaler inventories back to more normal levels. Wine and spirits results for Q2 benefitted from higher volume and lower promotional expense during the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to reach their full year profit goals and we are affirming our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at Q2 performance in more detail. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales grew 10%. This result included 73 million of incremental beer net sales as we consolidated an additional week of sales in Q2 fiscal '15 versus Q2 fiscal '14 as a result of the timing of the beer business acquisition. Excluding the benefit of these acquired sales, consolidated organic net sales growth for the quarter was 5%. For the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '15 versus the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '14, beer segment organic net sales increased 9%. This was primarily from volume growth driven by strong consumer demand. This result includes the impact of the recall that I just outlined. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflected volume growth of 1% and lower promotional expense. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $109 million and our consolidated gross margin was 43% versus 40% from the prior year second quarter. The increase in gross profit primarily reflects 33 million of incremental benefit from consolidating the beer business for one additional week in Q2 of fiscal '15 as well as growth of the base beer business and lower promotional expense and favorable mix for wine and spirits. The increase in consolidated gross margin primarily reflects higher brewery profits, beer volume and pricing benefits in the wine and spirits gross profit factors that I just mentioned. SG&A for the quarter increased $48 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was 12 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, Q2 consolidated operating income increased 62 million and consolidated operating margin improved 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was 85 million, down 6% versus Q2 last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our deposition. At the end of August, our total debt was 7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled 7.1 billion, an increase of 131 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The increase primarily reflects the funding of the 558 million post-closing purchase price adjustment payment made during the quarter for the beer transaction offset by our free cash flow generation. We have 500 million of 8 3/8 senior notes coming due in December. We\u2019re evaluating funding alternatives for the repayment of this debt including utilizing existing credit facilities and tapping into the senior note market. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32% and compares to a 29% rate for Q2 fiscal '14. The Q2 fiscal '14 rate included the favorable outcome of various tax items. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate to approximate 30%. Now let\u2019s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx spend. For the first half of fiscal '15, we generated 360 million of free cash flow compared to 440 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first half of the year totaled 668 million versus 489 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the incremental cash generated by the consolidated beer business. CapEx for the first half of fiscal '15 totaled 308 million compared to 49 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled 229 million as activities for the initial 10 million hectoliter brewery expansion continue to progress. For fiscal 2015, we are updating our free cash flow projection and now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 275 million to 350 million versus the previous range of 425 million to 500 million. The change was primarily driven by additional CapEx requirements for the incremental 5 million hectoliter brewery expansion and glass sourcing initiatives that Rob mentioned earlier. Total CapEx is now projected to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million versus a previous 575 million to 625 million. Our new CapEx projection includes 600 million to 650 million for the beer segment. We view this as very positive news as we have the opportunity to invest in a growing, high margin, high ROIC business. We are still targeting operating cash flow to reach at least $1 billion for fiscal '15 and we expect to continue deleveraging. Now let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We continue to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. For fiscal '15 we continue to target net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10% with high single digit shipment and depletion volume growth and operating income growth in the range of 25% to 30%. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery for fiscal 2014, underline operating income growth for the beer segment is still expected to be in the mid teens. For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal '15 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. Now I\u2019d like to provide some financial highlights related to our strategies around glass sourcing and beer production capacity that Rob outlined. Our beer business has great momentum in the marketplace growing ahead of our expectations since the acquisition and well ahead of the total beer category. We believe we are positioned to continue outpacing the beer category behind positive demographic and portfolio factors, some of which include consumers trading up to high-end beer, growth and increasing influence of the Hispanic consumer who have a high propensity for our brands, great alignment with our goal to distributor network, distribution gains for all brands, draft and can format expansion and packaging and product innovation. As a result of these factors, we are targeting annual volume growth to be in the mid-single-digit range over fiscal '16 to fiscal '18 timeframe, a sales trend that we believe would outpace growth projections of the total U.S. beer industry. To ensure we are best positioned to capture this growth opportunity, we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery, which will take it to 25 million hectoliters of production capacity. The estimated cost for this investment is 450 million to 550 million and is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2017. When you combine this with our initial 10 million hectoliter expansion, our total brewery capacity investment is estimated to be $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. As part of our beer, glass sourcing strategy, we have reached an agreement with ABI to acquire their glass plant, warehouse and rail infrastructure and land that is adjacent to our Nava brewery for an acquisition purchase price of about $300 million. We\u2019ve also agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate this glass plant. O-I will contribute approximately 100 million for its 50% share of the joint venture. The joint venture will not include the acquired warehouse, rail infrastructure or land. The JV will provide bottles exclusively for the Nava brewery. The glass JV partners plan to expand the capacity of the plant from one furnace to four furnaces over the next four years at a cost of approximately $300 million to $400 million. The expansion costs will be shared equally between Constellation and Owens-Illinois. Since we expect to consolidate the JV results, the full expansion costs would be included in our CapEx line in our statement of cash flows with O-I\u2019s contribution being displayed as a separate benefit in the financing section of our cash flow statement. Constellation also expects to spend approximately 175 million to 225 million outside of the JV to enhance the site infrastructure for the rail and warehouse at the newly acquired site. For the beer business projects just highlighted, we have summarized the associated tax assessments and timeframes in a table that was included in our glass sourcing and capacity expansion press release issued earlier today. Given the collective activities just outlined, we are targeting our beer segment operating margin to be in the mid 30% range in fiscal '18, which we believe is best-in-class among the North American competitors. With the incremental CapEx investment, our goal of exceeding free cash flow generation of $1 billion is now targeted to move out in fiscal '18. Even with the higher CapEx requirements, we still expect to delever at a good pace and reach our goal of debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio below four times in fiscal '16, as operating cash flow and EBITDA growth of the business allows to delever despite the increased capital spend. Operating within our three to four times target leverage range provides us the financial flexibility to access the initiation of a dividend and/or additional stock buybacks. Once we move past the heavy fiscal '16 and '17 peak CapEx spend years, free cash flow should growth dramatically, which will provide us even more financial flexibility while we stay within our targeted leverage ratio range. In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with how fiscal '15 is progressing. The wine segment is expected to grow EBIT in line with sales and see strong execution in the marketplace during the key holiday season. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. It has a very strong financial profile and is among the industry leaders from a sales growth and profit margin perspective. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for the beer business. With that, we\u2019ll open up the line for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Robert Ryder : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : I guess we fielded a few questions this morning just trying to reconcile the margin expectations in beer relative to some of the new news we had today, and I guess maybe if you can just walkthrough some of the puts and takes because right now it looks like if you look back at the last four quarters or so, the operating profit margin in beer are in the low 30s. And I guess what we\u2019re expecting to see over the next three years is more capacity, more production in in-house which should be accretive to margins. It sounds like glass cost would be lower which should be accretive to margins. There\u2019s been some pricing in this model over the last year or so and I would assume that there should be some pricing as we look forward. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why it wouldn\u2019t be better if there is some other cost that you\u2019re expecting to incur whether it\u2019s increased marketing or something else that might sort of dampen the margin expectations? Robert Ryder : Yes. So year-to-date we\u2019re at a 32% operating profit margin which has increased from last year. And what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re going to go to the mid-single digits as we build out the brewery and glass plant, right. So depending where you pick in the mid-single digits, that\u2019s pretty good margin expansion. The other thing to factor in is we think mid-single digits is pretty much the highest operating profit margin of beer companies in North America, right, the mid-30%. So in our models, we have factored in all that\u2019s going on with glass, we put assumption there what we think is going to go on with pricing based on history and we have in there what we think is going to go on with commodity inflation in the beer segment. So for me personally, right, I\u2019m thrilled with the mid-30% profit margin. I\u2019m not sure why people are disappointed. There is nobody with a higher margin than that in North America. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : I guess and I hear you, I think it\u2019s just kind of knowing what we know now and there seemingly to be more of a list of tailwinds versus headwinds, I think that\u2019s the component that people are kind of stuck on today. There\u2019s two things you can clarify. When we\u2019re talking about mid-30s, is that 34 to 36? And then I guess the second piece, I guess if there is going to be some JV income associated with glass, should that be \u2013 is that incorporated in that mid-30 margin target or would that be on top of? Robert Ryder : Yes. So mid-30%, yes, I guess most math people would say that\u2019s 34, 36. I think that\u2019s a reasonable comment. The other thing just to factor this in, Bryan, and you guys would have done that, right, this increased capital spend does increase depreciation expense, right. Now, our brewery assets are long-lived assets, right, the majority is probably 15 to 20 years, but there\u2019s a lot of capital going in which is going to start depreciating which does cause some reported headwinds on margins. And what was the last piece of\u2026? Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : The JV income? Robert Ryder : Yes, good question. And again, you guys understand this, so we will be consolidating the JV because under GAAP based on the contract with us and Owens-Illinois, we are considered to control the JV, right. So what will happen there is as consolidation, we will just \u2013 our cost of goods sold will be lower. We\u2019ll essentially be recording the cost of the bottles, right, which helps margins, okay. We will also consolidate the balance sheet, right, so you\u2019ll see all that capital spending coming on our balance sheet and the Owens-Illinois contribution will come in down \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to be a separate line of net income, okay, and the cash contribution will be begin the financing section of the cash flow statement. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : So that makes it outside of the operating profit and the margins? Robert Ryder : That\u2019s correct. Well, JV, yes, because we\u2019ll be consolidating. So the JV will not exist in our financial statements, right. The JV is going to be a private company is how that will work. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good morning. Robert Ryder : Hi, Judy. Robert Sands : Good morning. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs : I guess I wanted to just follow up on the EBIT margin on beer and I agree that the mid-30% is obviously a very good margin for this business. I guess I would just challenge you though in just terms of thinking about compared to the other beer companies, you do have higher price points which obviously raises your gross margin versus some of the peers. So I\u2019m just trying to really understand kind of how this margin outlook is being impacted by the cost savings that you\u2019re generating really on the packaging costs, in particular as you think about what you\u2019re paying for glass today and then with all these different relationships that you\u2019re building. And then the JV that you\u2019re owning in-house, it seems like your packaging cost could be a lot higher, so maybe just starting off just a little bit more color on that particular topic? Robert Ryder : Yes, and it\u2019s a little bit difficult, right, because a lot of data is not out there but we have a very different business model from the North American \u2013 most of the North American competitors, right. We\u2019re making all our products in one site which is quite a distance from a lot of our consumers, right, take the New York city consumers. So we have a reasonable amount more freight, okay, versus \u2013 and freight is \u2013 as you know, Judy, freight is a very big component of cost in beer. So we have a lot more freight costs. We probably also have higher cost of goods sold, right; thicker bottles, higher quality ingredients, all that kind of stuff. So it\u2019s difficult to compare them apples-to-apples. But as I look at our beer model, we\u2019ve kind of got the growth that the craft brewers have coupled with the margins that the large domestic guys have. So we\u2019re almost the best of both worlds from a beer perspective. And if you look at some of the data that\u2019s out there, right, generally speaking you could say we\u2019re probably paying around, I don\u2019t know, $0.16 a bottle right now. That data is out there from InBev. We\u2019ve said that that will come down. We\u2019re not really saying how much that will come down because we think that\u2019s competitive data, but we went through a full year of negotiations with all the big glass players in the world and we\u2019re pretty happy where we end up there both from a cost and a quality perspective. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just to clarify, the $0.16 includes the freight cost that you\u2019re paying to get the bottle delivered to your production facility? Robert Ryder : That\u2019s correct, but the glass we\u2019ll be getting going forward is going to be coming from a number of different sources which will all have different, I\u2019ll say, manufacturing costs and different freight costs depending where it\u2019s coming from. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs : Right, okay. And then maybe just in terms of the Corona Extra trend and I think that accretion certainly in the quarter doesn\u2019t appear to have been impacted by the recall. The more recent Nielsen or IRI data has shown a bit of softer trend for Corona Extra and some of this may just be a comparison issue, but just really wanted to kind of understand from your perspective how do you access the recall impact, if any, is having on sort of the underlying trend of Corona Extra as you see it today? Robert Ryder : Yes. Judy, so right now as you said we look at IRI, it\u2019s still pretty early in the game to say what\u2019s happened to Corona Extra and I don\u2019t get overly alarmed over weekly IRI data because there\u2019s a lot of anomalies in just a week. You can see that Corona Extra has slowed down a little bit, but remember there were actually some retailers \u2013 not a ton but we were physically out of stock during the recall process, we were off the shelf for a period of time. So we would expect that to kind of come across in IRI. Luckily, we\u2019re very happy with our overall depletion trends, right, and hopefully if Corona \u2013 the consumer wasn\u2019t grabbing the Corona, he would grab a Modelo Especial or Pacifico and I guess in future months, we\u2019ll see how the Corona Extra brand bounces back after this recall. But we couldn\u2019t ask for better cooperation from both our internal employees and from the distributors and from retailers. It was just a really well done and an unfortunate circumstance, but we think we minimized the damage. Robert Sands : Judy, I might add that we\u2019ve been tracking the weekly IRIs pretty carefully. We saw a little blip two weeks ago but we also noticed a number of other products that were affected, so it looks like it might have been a peculiarity with the week and then the latest data was very robust and appears that the brand was completely unaffected. So as Bob said, we\u2019re pretty hopeful that in general the recall is not going to have any impact on the momentum on the brand. And clearly the momentum on our other brands has been totally unaffected by the Corona recall. So the business in general remains very strong from a consumer takeaway point of view. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs : Okay, got it. Thank you. Robert Ryder : Thanks, Judy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. A couple of questions. Just getting back to the beer margin because I know obviously that\u2019s the most frequently asked question coming in from investors. So is it fair to assume that the target you have laid out, the kind of mid-30s; 34 to 36, is pegged to your mid-single-digit volume assumption? I guess the reason why I\u2019m asking the question is let\u2019s just say that things are even better than you thought which clearly has been the case the last couple of years, things have been coming in better than you expected and volumes are actually higher. I\u2019m just wondering how you think that will impact the margin given now you are manufacturing, you should get some operating leverage, so if you can address that question would be really helpful. And the second question just kind of more of a tactical thing, just curious how the repositioning of Victoria is doing? If you can give us any more clarity around Modelo Chelada, it looks like the SKU and the brand is really starting to gain some momentum, so just trying to get an understanding of how big of a contributor that can be going forward? Robert Ryder : Okay, Nik, so I\u2019ll take the first one and Rob will take the commercial question. So, yes, I mean when we give these guidance out, we try to tie-in the whole P&L. So in your case if we exceed the volumes that we put out there, obviously we would get good fixed cost leverage, okay, especially on that big depreciation number. So, yes, that would certainly help margins. I\u2019ll let Rob answer the Victoria\u2026? Robert Sands : Yes, so Victoria; we did reposition Victoria originally when we introduced it \u2013 we introduced it above Corona Extra in pricing and we brought the pricing on that down to the Corona level and we expanded distribution nationally and I would say that there\u2019s a lot of momentum behind the brand right now. Actually I\u2019d say that we\u2019re pretty excited about the prospects for Victoria for the feature and with the repositioning we\u2019re seeing a lot of very, very positive momentum in that. Chelada; great product, taste great. We really think that from a competitive point of view it\u2019s the best product out there. Again, a lot of momentum. We\u2019re a bit constrained on the package at the moment until we get our can line up and running shortly and that\u2019s really been the only limiting factor on the brand. Otherwise, we could actually sell a lot more of it than in fact we have been selling and we will as soon as that can line is up and running which is it\u2019s actually up and running right this second, but in terms of being fully operational it\u2019s a few weeks away. So we\u2019re extremely optimistic on Chelada and think that that\u2019s going to be a very successful new product introduction for us. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Great. And just one last question, thanks for that Rob. So Bob, on the Nava brewery, if we look at it year-over-year, is the brewery running more efficiently, same as last year, less efficient \u2013 I mean can you just give us some perspective on how things have progressed over the last year within the brewery? Robert Ryder : Yes, it\u2019s operating more efficiently, right. So we\u2019re getting \u2013 and we\u2019re defining that. We\u2019re actually getting more hectoliters of beer out of it at a lower cost per hectoliter and actually it\u2019s almost like every quarter it gets a little bit better. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Great, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. Just a question on your assumptions on price and mix. You gave us a good idea on volumes for beer going forward. Just how you\u2019re thinking about the mix component and also whether you think there is room to get some pricing? Robert Sands : You\u2019re talking beer I take it. Caroline Levy - CLSA: In this case, yes. Robert Ryder : Yes, I don\u2019t think we assumed any dramatic increase in mix but as you said, the thing supporting the volume growth calls for a lot of growth in cans and kegs. So they would have a mix impact. On pricing, we would have assumed probably historical pricing going forward, but as you know pricing gets determined based on the local geographies and all the competitive dynamics, but for an Excel model you have to assume something. So we would have just assumed probably close to continuation of historical trends. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right. So you\u2019re saying mix will go slightly negative as you rollout cans and kegs? Robert Sands : No. Cans would be a positive mix; kegs kind of neutral that\u2019s because aluminum is cheaper than glass and cans cube out better with freight. You can fit more on a freight car than bottles because you don\u2019t have to insulate them and they\u2019re just better\u2026 Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right. So a bit of margin mix but on revenue, on price mix\u2026? Robert Sands : Cans, we are line priced on cans except for Modelo Especial cans which are at a slightly lower price. For Modelo Especial specifically right now bottles are growing faster than cans. Probably the big can upside is on Corona Extra where we expect to have the same price as bottles. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Got it. And how is your can capacity doing for the Corona Extra product? Robert Sands : It will be doing well very shortly as soon as that new can line is fully operational which as I said is shortly. It\u2019s actually up and running right now but in test mode. Caroline Levy - CLSA: But you\u2019ll run all cans on that line then and you\u2019ll be able to therefore drive this much faster on Corona Extra as well as on Chelada. Robert Ryder : Yes, so what you\u2019ll be seeing and we\u2019re actually coming out with a really gorgeous Victoria can as well, but our can capacity will be going up and will be able to support all this can growth. And also on Corona Extra specifically we\u2019ve actually already have a media campaign specifically I\u2019ll say describing the activities you would do with a can that you wouldn\u2019t do with the bottle. Same great Corona liquid, right, but you can do certain things with cans that you can\u2019t with bottles and shots of the beach, the boats, sporting events, things like that just to get peoples\u2019 heads around, hey, Corona is great. Let me try a can. Right now, Corona Extra probably less than 2% of the mix is cans. So we think that\u2019s a pretty big opportunity to drive growth. Robert Sands : If you look at the industry in general, what you\u2019ll see is cans is really where the vast majority of the growth is in the industry. You may be looked at the domestics which as you know are biometrically in general down but cans are actually growing and are being more than offset by glass and craft, cans are the latest craze. And as Bob said in our case, we see huge opportunity in cans because it\u2019s such a low percentage of our business and there is so much momentum from an industry perspective against cans period. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the can potential of our business. Caroline Levy - CLSA: That\u2019s great. And then if I might ask, it\u2019s back to margins, the components of what you think will drive the margins to the mid-30s and how much of that is the glass transaction? Robert Ryder : Yes, glass is certainly factored in there and essentially what will happen as the additional glass JV furnaces come up, right, we will be able to reduce the glass that we\u2019re buying from other furnaces. The guaranteed upside will be there is freight, right, because the glass JV is attached to the brewery. So there is no freight cost. So as those furnaces come up, our landed glass cost comes down. And so glass is a pretty good component of our margin expansion from the 32% that we have year-to-date to the mid-30% we said we\u2019ll have in the very near future. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions; one is a follow up to that. I think that you gave us originally a target of getting to the mid-30% margin without glass. So I\u2019d like to \u2013 what other things are going right between now and then besides glass to get the margin number? Robert Ryder : Yes, the guidance we gave without glass was low to mid 30%. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Okay. Robert Ryder : So you can go back to the investor meeting, so that was the guidance that we provided. Now with glass and with new news, right, whatever positives and negatives, we\u2019re increasing that to mid-30%. What you get is depending where you pick in the 34% to 36% is a pretty big increase in margins and the highest anybody has in North America. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be belaboring this, but you had said low to mid 30s without glass, so there was something that made you think you could get to the mid-30s without glass and it looks like maybe that contribution has gone away, and could you comment on that? Robert Ryder : Yes, I could but I do think we\u2019re past the belabored part here with this question, right. We give ranges because this is a business with many moving parts, okay, and especially this business as you know, Alice, has many moving parts because we\u2019re growing so fast. Most of the moving parts are really good as are our margin assumptions I think to have the volume growth amongst the top of the industry and to be saying we\u2019re getting to the margins in the top of the industry I think is \u2013 I\u2019m looking at this as very good news. And then the ability, right, to reinvest the enormous free cash flow that this business spins off into a very high return on invested capital business, right, it really helps the shareholder value creation that I think Constellation is driving out of this beer segment. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Okay. My question is on your cash flow for next year, for fiscal '16. You\u2019ve said that with all the incremental CapEx and your acquisition costs, you still think you\u2019ll be generating cash to reduce debt. You must have a pretty good sense of what CapEx will be in fiscal '16 in order to say that. I mean with all the bits and pieces you\u2019ve given us, it looks like CapEx might be around $1 billion in fiscal '16 and then you got 300 million for the acquisition and I\u2019m having trouble getting cash leftover after that. Are those assumptions for CapEx too high? Robert Ryder : So I think what I would do is we\u2019ve given you the bigger pieces of capital spending albeit we haven\u2019t said what specifically in fiscal '16 because that will be part of the guidance we provide in April. But we have said it\u2019s kind of frontend loaded right. What we provided in that table in the glass press release is not holistically comprehensive. It excludes wine, it excludes maintenance CapEx, it excludes buying kegs. It\u2019s specifically for these projects. Now my comment on deleveraging, right, because of all the capital spend, free cash flow probably won\u2019t be an enormous number next year. Now operating cash flow could be a very good number. But the leverage rate of course is happening is the EBITDA portion, the numerator of that calculation, right, based on the volume growth in the margin expansion is probably going up quite a bit which helps the EBITDA leverage ratio come down. So it\u2019s not necessarily free cash flow, right, it\u2019s more the EBITDA generation. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Well, that\u2019s helpful. Will there be cash leftover after the acquisition cost to reduce debt? Robert Ryder : We\u2019re not providing that kind of specific guidance yet for next year because we haven\u2019t finished this year yet. So that would be like an April discussion most likely. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Okay. But a lot of the improvement in the ratio is the EBITDA going up, I hear that. And I have one final question. If I adjust your margins in the quarter you just reported for the recall, it looks like they were 31%. They were a lot higher in the first quarter. Could you comment on why they came down and should we be using the 31% for the second half? Is there some reason to expect an improvement in the second half versus that 31%? Robert Ryder : I think we\u2019ve given our guidance for the full year that expect beer operating profit margins to be around 32%. This quarter there was a pretty big increase in marketing spend in beer specifically as we really tried to hit home in the peak summer season with a lot of media flights. So that would have been a timing component. But I think year-to-date we\u2019re at about 32% and we said full year we\u2019ll be at about 32%. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Thank you very much. It\u2019s marketing. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Also on this topic of margin, Bob, a question about the glass component of it. Is it reasonable to think that the fact that this O-I arrangement is with a facility that\u2019s state-of-the-art and right next door to where you\u2019re brewing is better economically than the Vitro arrangement? Robert Ryder : I think that probably would make sense given the fact as you said it\u2019s a brand new facility, right, and of course freight will be less. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Right, okay. And then on the Vitro component because there wasn\u2019t quite the level of detail back in August that we get into today, did that \u2013 the new Vitro agreement you have, is that going to \u2013 the cost that you\u2019re paying there for those bottles, does that include transportation costs? Robert Ryder : We haven\u2019t commented on that. That\u2019s kind of competitive information. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, all right. Robert Ryder : That was Vitro\u2019s release, that wasn\u2019t our release. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Right, okay, fair enough. And then just more on the accounting for this JV. Clear that it\u2019s going to be consolidated. Can you just help us? It sounds like it affects only your COGS line. Does it have any effect on other consolidated lines and then there\u2019s just a minority interest coming out below the EBIT line, is that how the economy will be? Robert Ryder : I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s just the COGS line. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Got it. Robert Ryder : And then the minority interest, that\u2019s correct, it will come out as a component of net income and other cash. And then of course the balance sheet is consolidated, right, so all the capital spending will end up there and the cash coming in from Owens-Illinois and they will be funding 50% of all capital investments at the glass JV but that\u2019s going to come through the financing line. Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Bob. Robert Ryder : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Thanks. A few quick ones. On the new expansion at Nava, does that I guess come in place of a potential West Coast facility down the road? You went through the math and it made more sense from a freight efficiency standpoint to do it all at Nava? Robert Ryder : Yes, I think a couple of things. I think it was probably the fastest thing to do, right, because the facility is up and growing and we want to make sure that we can support a high growing, high margin beer business. So I think as we weigh the alternatives, we felt that both cost and speed, right, and confidence around execution was highest for Nava to bring that up to 25 million hectoliters. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: And believe it or not, I have a wine question. In terms of the lower promotions this quarter, is that just more timing? You\u2019re kind of waiting it more, is that kind of what you had planned all along, maybe some color there? Robert Sands : Yes, the timing of our promotional activities is more geared towards the second half of the year obviously to coincide with the OND period, the holiday period. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay, so it\u2019s just on a year-over-year basis it\u2019s been shifted a little bit? Robert Sands : Yes. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then last one on taxes just to get to your full year rate of 30% kind of \u2013 it equates to 28% for the back half. Is that equal in both quarters or would there be one kind of catch-up one quarter? Robert Ryder : Yes, the timing of taxes is hard to predict. So we\u2019re just saying for the full year, it will be 30%. So we\u2019re not saying which quarter it will hit, what quarter will be what. But the balance of the year will have to be a lower rate than the year-to-date. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI Group. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : Thank you very much for taking the call. Guys, given the increased amount of CapEx and in a sense business outside of the U.S., how should we think about any impact on the cash tax rate going forward, the long-term numbers and the effect of tax rate, maybe you can give us an update in terms of the long-term guidance on those two items? Robert Ryder : Yes, as we generate a lot of income from this as you said outside the U.S., that will carry a lower cash tax rate. As far as effective tax rate, it should also have a lower effective tax rate when everybody gets aligned that we stop accruing U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. We are still accruing U.S. taxes on the foreign earnings and there\u2019s just a lot of discussions going on as to when or if we will stop accruing those taxes. That\u2019s from an ETR not a cash tax rate. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : Right. So just in terms of your guidance that you gave us for cash for fiscal '18, what cash tax rate would you be using for that? Robert Ryder : I think we\u2019re assuming like mid-20s. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : Mid-20s. And there will be potential for that to go down in the following years? Robert Ryder : No, cash is cash, right. The thing that could go down if we stop accruing the APB 23 U.S. accruals, the ETR could go down. Of course, if we grow the beer business faster than we say, right, that will have a lower cash tax rate. It\u2019s kind of a mix of tax rates depending where your EBIT growth is coming from. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : Great. And I know you\u2019ve got a significant initiative on the can side. Can you give us just any kind of rough idea as you think about it between the relative margins for glass and cans for your business? Robert Ryder : Yes, I mean cans are higher margin than bottles. It\u2019s not tremendously material nor is it immaterial. So it\u2019s the difference that we like if you align price with bottles. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : So like 100 basis points on the margin type difference? Robert Sands : Yes, we\u2019re not going to give you that kind of specifics. Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group : Understood. Congratulations on all the glass contracts. I\u2019m sure that was a tremendous amount of work and it sounds like you\u2019ve come to a great solution. Robert Sands : Excellent. Thanks, Robert. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hello. This is Paul (indiscernible). Can you hear me? Robert Ryder : Sure. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. I just have a couple of questions. First, what\u2019s your view of tapping the bank loan respond market for your 2014 debt maturity and do you guys have limitations on how much bank debt you can add? Robert Sands : Yes, we don\u2019t feel there is any limitations that would hold us back. I mean we\u2019re looking at the markets as we speak and I think we\u2019re in a great position. We can utilize our revolver which is at a very good rate or we can go to the senior market if we want to kind of increase the duration of our debt. And it\u2019s going to be based on what we think the market\u2019s rates are. So it will be a decision that we can make without any pressure from the outside world or covenants or anything like that. There is a lot of flexibility that we have. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And have you guys spoken with the rating agencies at all regarding your expectation that leverage will remain over four times through 2016? Robert Sands : We have, yes. So the rating agencies are insiders, so they have a look at how we think the financials will pan out and I think they\u2019d be pretty happy with how quickly we are delevering and again mostly it\u2019s because we\u2019re growing EBITDA so quickly which just shows the fundamental positive economics of the business. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research. Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : Good morning. Thanks. Just one final point on the overly [belabored] beer margin question. You don\u2019t give EBITDA margin targets on that, but it sounds to me like it would be fair to say, well, while margins are going up modestly, EBITDA margins are going to go up more meaningfully. Is that a fair statement? Robert Ryder : I\u2019m not sure if I understand the question. We\u2019re not commenting all around O-I margins but EBITDA is certainly growing which is helping bring down the EBITDA leverage\u2026 Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : But what people seem to be missing is that the depreciation is impacting the O-I margin and so the EBITDA will be a better number based on the cash\u2026? Robert Ryder : Sure. As we said earlier, right, there is a lot of [DA] (ph) coming into the P&L as spend all this capital. I don\u2019t know why you keep saying O-I. This has nothing to do with O-I. They\u2019re not on our books. But yes, the EBITDA to your point will be much higher than the EBIT because DA is going up so much, right, is your point which is a good point. Thank you. Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : Okay. And then just finally on wine, it is a beautiful crop out there and I\u2019m almost done harvest. It looks to me like margins have the ability to expand a bit going into fiscal '16. Would you agree with that statement just directionally? Robert Sands : Yes. We think that margins can expand a little bit going into fiscal '16. Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : Okay. Robert Sands : We\u2019re seeing growth, we\u2019re seeing positive mix and we\u2019re seeing a little pricing. That\u2019s a good combination. Robert Ryder : As you said, Tim, the crop is coming in very high quality and we think overall the cost per ton will be similar to last year, so not a lot of grape cost inflation which is good news for margins. Robert Sands : I think generally a balanced supply and demand situation. Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : Because we\u2019re a month ahead if there are any meaningful impact on cash flow this year from just the timing of harvest or is that not material? Robert Ryder : No, there won\u2019t be anything meaningful. Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research : Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Robert Sands : Thanks a lot, Tim. Operator : That was our final question. I would like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional remarks. Robert Sands : Thanks everyone for joining our call today. Needless to say, it\u2019s an exciting time to be in Constellation. We believe we have very significant growth opportunity within our beer business and glass of course is a critical component of our beer production. As such, I\u2019m very pleased with the final outcome of our long-term glass strategy with key industry players in order to ensure that we have the quality, capability and flexibility to meet the growing demand for our iconic beer portfolio. We also have solid momentum for our wine and spirits business as we head into the second half of the year, and we are well positioned for a great holiday selling season. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the holidays. So thanks again everybody for your participation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty. And good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Hope everybody got a chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends.  Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014.  Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the three-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business which has incredible momentum and we believe strong potential for future growth. And we\u2019re making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future.  In addition to our on-going brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass sourcing strategy which includes the acquisition of ABI\u2019s state-of-the-art glass plant which is located adjacent to our Nava brewery. The formation of a 50 :50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant, and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process.  Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation\u2019s beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter. We\u2019re growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results brand by brand across the entire business.  Corona Extra continues to dominate as the number one imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic Find Your Beach and Epic Moments advertising campaigns as well as the return of the O' Tannenbaum spot on English and Spanish language TV during the holiday season. Modelo Especial continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the number two imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail take away volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter.  Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft which entered three new markets as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions which helped merchandise the draft format in the on-premise channel during football season. Overall the strong shipment volumes that the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. Keep in mind the distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low teen range with operating profit growth of mid to high teens.  From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line which was installed in late summer has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our can product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity.  Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion and we have progressed with rail logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion.  Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on-site at the newly acquired factory.  Overall I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales marketing and operations teams as well as our distributors who are collectively working together to deliver winning results.  And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low to mid single digit guidance range that we previously provided.  Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble tequila brand into our portfolio and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The super premium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions both on and off premise.  We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy Peach flavor. In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share of the three spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy. From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third-quarter results although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in bulk wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe.  In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus our third-quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations.  In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium priced products are growing faster than our super premium and above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion especially in the super premium price segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth. However we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers in all key price segments. For example, the wine consumers\u2019 willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development.  And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline.  In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wine such as PopCrush, Tom Gore Vineyards, Jail Break, Watchdog Rock and early lunch results for these brands are quite positive. We know however that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and growth momentum.  Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year as we are falling short of our initial expectations for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhance wholesaler and retail execution.  We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands.  Market Watch magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Sommelier Challenge International Wine competition. Inniskillin Vidal 2012 reached the 99 point score, and Wine of The Year while Ruffino received seven medals, including best in class distinction and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus.  Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast Buying Guide, while Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90 point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of lines.  In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico and we\u2019ve begun to execute our new glass sourcing arrangements while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. We have a great premium wine business and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I'm especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks for the third consecutive year.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results. Bob Ryder : Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That\u2019s a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal \u201915.  As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter.  Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3 as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal \u201815 we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%.  Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal \u201915. When factoring in an estimated full-year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid to high teens range. We still anticipate the full-year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%.  While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal \u201815 we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low to mid single digit range and EBIT at the high end of our low to mid single digit range.  Due to the factors just mentioned, we\u2019re increasing our fiscal \u201815 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. Given those highlights, let\u2019s look at Q3 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.  As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%.  Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume, offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales.  For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and the favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased just over one percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business.  SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points.  Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.  That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal \u201914.  During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile combined with the favorable interest rate environment helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the note issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375 notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million for fiscal \u201915.  Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to a 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full-year fiscal \u201915 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%.  Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal \u201815 we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first nine months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business.  CapEx for the first nine months of fiscal \u201815 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal \u201815 we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment.  As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedged contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, the gain or loss is allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3 there was a $20 million loss from this activity which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts.  Before we start taking your questions, I\u2019d like to note we're very pleased with how fiscal \u201815 has progressed so far and we believe we are well-positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category.  We\u2019re also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV\u2019s acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment.  With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : So two questions from me. Just on the wine side, you had really good margin expansion. Obviously volumes were a bit light, and I am just curious did you make a concerted decision to really prioritize margin of a volume, is that what we should expect kind of over the next 12 to 24 months? And then the last question is just, if you can give us some updated thoughts on debt to EBITDA continues to migrate towards your target, how we should be thinking about cash flow distribution to shareholders? Bob Ryder : Sure. As you saw we did have good beer margin \u2013 I am sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth and high end of EBIT growth which means that we will see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the line segment to maintain margins. I think there were some positive outcomes this year mostly around cost of goods sold which are really helping recover margins from the last few years\u2019 erosion. But I wouldn\u2019t expect big margin expansion in the wine segment going forward. But we do expect to at least maintain margins. And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we\u2019re spending a ton of money in the beer segment which we're quite happy to do because return on capital in that segment is north of 40%. So it\u2019s a very quick payback and the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much and again a lot of that's driven by the beer segment the phenomenal EBITDA growth there. So I think in line with what we've been saying over the last two years, as we have pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below four times, I would say that the number one agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders and probably at the top of that list would be an initiation of a dividend. We\u2019re one of the few people certainly with our financial profile and in beverage alcohol and consumers in general -- consumer products in general they don't have a dividend and we\u2019re quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So wee will probably be looking for dividend in the very near future. Nik Modi : And just real quick follow-up on that dividend point. When you think about the initiation, are you thinking about something nominal to begin with or do you think you can go closer to the payout ratio of your peers from the get-go just given the free cash flow generation of the company? Bob Ryder : Yes, we\u2019re still studying it. We are taking some good outside advice. But I would probably expect us to start on the lower side in order to give us a lot of room for increases. But we will look at the normal things like payout ratios, and because we expect our EBITDA to grow mostly behind beer to grow so robustly over the next few years, right, if you kind of set a payout ratio and your net income keeps going up we should have room to increase it. But we probably start out at the lower end. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I\u2019ve got two questions. One, just, I think in your prepared remarks when you walked through the commentary on the mark-to-market activity you referenced there was $20 million loss relative to that activity in the quarter. Was that $20 million included in the results or was it excluded from the result? Bob Ryder : The $20 million was included in the GAAP results but we excluded from comparable earnings. And the reason we do this, when we \u2013 none of our commodity hedges qualify for hedge accounting and we are hedging three years out. So you would see a lot of volatility in a quarter because you\u2019d be marking to market almost 3 years of hedges every quarter, right? So we\u2019re kind of putting that stuff in non-comparable earnings. It\u2019s still in the press release, so you can see it. But we think it would kind of confuse the financial statement reader if we saw that in comparable results every quarter. And this quarter not surprisingly because of the rapid fall in fuel prices when we marked to market our diesel hedges there were losses and was about $20 million for the quarter. Bryan Spillane : But by the time those hedges get settled at some point in the future if things don't change that settled hedge, will that somehow \u2013 could that potentially drag margins at some point in the future because it\u2019s so far out of the money or \u2013 Bob Ryder : Yes, absolutely. So sorry, I might have missed out last point. We will bring the gains or losses on these hedge contracts into comparable earnings when the contracts are settled. So to your point if diesel fuel prices don't change, this $20 million loss will come into the comparable results and we will allocate it to the individual segments based on their usage of fuel and because there's a lot more cases the majority of our fuel hedges are for the beer segment, although there are some for the wine segment as well. Bryan Spillane : And then just a second question related to foreign exchange. The dollar has strengthened relative to the peso pretty recently, and I guess I am curious to know, you have some peso denominated costs both in your capital spending, I am assuming some of the labor associated with the construction on the Nava brewery and also in your cost of goods sold in the beer business, I'm assuming there\u2019s some peso related costs, or denominated costs in your cost of goods sold. So can you talk about if the dollar would continue to remain strong relative to the peso or continue to strengthen relative to the peso, will it have a positive effect both on what your dollar cash cost outlays are for Nava, and also will it have any impact at all on the gross profits of the beer business? Bob Ryder : So good question. So in the beer segment and look, in the grand scheme of things we're very much a North American business and actually very much a US business and in the grand scheme of things we are a net importer. So a strong dollar will help us in the grand scheme of things. Now as you can see this quarter from a translation perspective there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the US dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings, that was about a 1% hurt to our sales.  On the peso specifically, our peso exposed costs are as you said Mexican labor, which is an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold. But it's a relatively large piece and also as we spend capital, those capital costs by and large get capitalized in pesos. So the depreciation on those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that\u2019s not necessarily cash because it's depreciation. So net, net the strong dollar will help us versus a Mexican import cost. That also being said we do hedge our transaction currencies. So we aren't 100% exposed to those peso costs because we will have some hedges going out. But net, net a strong dollar versus the peso helps us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So I wanted to get an update on growth for the draft and can portions of your business in the quarter, and also what you think the cannibalization levels are in the remainder of your business from expansion in those two areas, or if draft is even additive to your business? And also, can you give us an update on the future plans in draft and extending additional brands into that segment, whether it's Corona Light or other brands, in terms of moving into more markets with Corona Light? Rob Sands : Yes, Dara, number one, we have seen very strong growth in our draft business, about 40% growth and we\u2019ve actually seen very little cannibalization with the draft business. We\u2019ve introduced it with brands like Corona Light and in actuality not only is there not cannibalization but when we put Corona Light draft in a on-premise establishment we tend to see a pickup in the bottle or can product in the area around it, because it's really marketing. So we've expanded our Corona Light draft into, for instance, three new markets and we've also been testing Corona in draft as well and are again having extremely positive results seeing you almost no cannibalization of our glass product when we put draft in, although we\u2019re being very careful about that because we want to fully understand what the impact is.  Cans, same thing, great can growth, great can opportunity, represents obviously a very large portion of the market that we haven't participated in. Cans are purchased for consumption in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, beach, stadiums etc. and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business. Dara Mohsenian : And then also can you discuss distribution expansion potential for the Modelo Especial brand, including where you currently stand from a distribution standpoint, your expectations for calendar 2015 versus the level of expansion you saw in calendar 2014, so is it continuing with the same pace or accelerating, decelerating? And then also just longer-term where you think the brand\u2019s distribution level can get to versus Corona or other brands in the industry? Rob Sands : So first of all, Modelo Especial has a huge runway for growth. Right now we\u2019re at about \u2013 on IRI terms 60% ACV and that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The products still skews from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though its penetration in the Hispanic population isn\u2019t even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market and in the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial and driving distribution and pods are one of our key initiatives on that brand. So and it\u2019s going extremely successfully. We\u2019ve introduced this year -- because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well we\u2019ve introduced general market television advertising which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration -- exactly where it's going to get to, I mean fully distributed product is usually around, I don\u2019t know, 90% ACV. So exactly when we get there, I don't know but we\u2019re going to work to get there and we have everything going in our favor. So the ability to increased distribution and as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial, continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that\u2019s growing like Modelo Especial and just even anecdotally as you start, go around see what people are drinking, I mean you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : A few questions. First, Bob, on the new sales guidance for beer, I just wanted to clarify that, that change is really all related to the shipment outperforming versus depletion in the third quarter and you're not expecting any sort of acceleration in terms of depletion growth going forward. And on that note, would you expect to see some improvement with gas prices down and you\u2019ve got a lot of growth initiatives behind your broader portfolio on beer? Bob Ryder : So the increase in beer is \u2013because depletions are pretty much within our guidance, right, of like high single digits and actually depletion growth has been very consistent. The impressive thing is there is sequential improvement because Q3 and Q4 is overlapping higher growth last year. So we\u2019re very happy with the top line. The reason for the increase in guidance is more so around the net sales increase and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing inventories back in line with historical levels.  Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I am not sure but it's certainly better to have more money in consumers\u2019 pockets than less. Judy Hong : And just on that note, just the divergence in terms of maybe the category performance where wine perhaps was sequentially a little bit weaker from a category level even with the consumer getting better, do you have any sense of what's driving some of the category softness in wine? Rob Sands : The category is off a little bit. It still remains quite healthy. There could be a number of factors that are contributing to that. Last year Moscato and red blends were growing at extremely rapid rates as consumers experimented, I\u2019ll say, with the new products. This year those products are still growing very well but not at the rate that they were and not that this affects us particularly but there has been a lot of pricing being taken in the below five dollar commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price and that's turned into pretty heavy negative territories. So I think that that's driving the overall market down, maybe 100 basis points or something to that effect. It\u2019s still trending pretty much sort of consistently plus or minus 100 basis points with where it\u2019s trended historically over the long-term. So but it is a little slower than we anticipated. Judy Hong : And then my last question, Bob, I have to ask a beer margin question. So 31.5%, very good margin but it was down a little bit versus last year. So was it all just related to the SG&A step-up and was gross margin actually relatively stable? And just the phasing of the new glass contract flowing through your cost, there is a timing of it because you have now the Vitro arrangement that started in October but it sounds like that\u2019s not going to really flow through until fiscal \u201916. So any color just in terms of the phasing of how each of those contracts will start to really flow through your P&L would be very helpful? Bob Ryder : So Judy, we would all be disappointed if you didn't ask a beer margin question. So thank you for restoring our faith. So I would say gross margin for the wine business was pretty consistent year-over-year. So yes, the majority of the reduction in operating margin was due to our SG&A ramp up -- beer was due to our SG&A ramp up. As we get off our transition services agreement we start stepping up in beer segment. We are maintaining the 32% operating profit margin for the beer segment for the year. So this is in line with what we expected.  Regarding the glass contracts, they really won\u2019t start to impact us until next fiscal year and even then the big impact is when we get our own furnaces up and when we get our own production up. So I wouldn't expect glass to have an enormous impact on margins in fiscal \u201816 either. It's more a longer dated than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Did you say how long the diesel hedges were? When should we be thinking about seeing an EBIT positive impact coming through for lower fuel? Bob Ryder : Well, it\u2019s a combination of things. And we don't hedge a 100%, so and we hedge, I will say, a smaller percent of our exposure in outer years. So we would hedge the most in the next 12 months and then month 12 to 24 will be lower percentage. So we will benefit for the unhedged piece, so we will benefit from that, right, because we\u2019re pretty much paying the spot rate. The negative is the mark to market on the hedges and when those hedges get closed out, we will see that loss in our comparable earnings. Tim Ramey : And then on the net debt to EBITDA, the way I do the math it looks like \u2013 yes, it might reach 4.0 times in the 4Q. I know your previous guidance has been below that by \u201816 and so maybe we\u2019re splitting hairs here. Are we a little ahead of the curve? Bob Ryder : I think we\u2019re pretty much where we expected. We\u2019d expect to be right around that 4.0 range at the end of the year. And you\u2019d have to see how our free cash flow comes in which we of course haven\u2019t even finished our plan next year but a lot of that will be dependent upon what quarter we spend a lot of the beer capital. But probably my guess is a lot of our deleveraging will occur in the back half of next year but we would expect to be below four times in fiscal \u201916, by the end of fiscal \u201916. And as our planning process comes through, we will get better visibility to it by quarter. Tim Ramey : And is that number kind of magical relative to the dividend discussion, maybe not for a covenant reason but just from management's mindset reason? Bob Ryder : We\u2019ve kind of made it magic I guess. Look, in all these discussions there's a lot of variables but we have to pick kind of one coefficient in the equation of fixed and what we\u2019ve said is it\u2019s the EBITDA leverage. And we\u2019ve said we will begin reassessing returning cash to shareholders, because as you know we\u2019ve been one of the more aggressive people in our space but we\u2019ve done it exclusively through stock buybacks, when we bought back about 20% of our shares, under 20 bucks a share. We still have 750 million available under our board authorization. But I think what we have said now, since a lot has happened since we stopped our \u2013 since we put the stock buyback program on hiatus, that dividend will now trump stock buyback. And what we\u2019ve said is when we have really good visibility to getting below four times and staying there, that's when we start assessing the dividend and as we\u2019ve all said that looks like it will be in fiscal \u201916. So we\u2019ll probably be talking about it for our fiscal \u201816 guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial. Mark Swartzberg : I guess two wine questions. One is the COGS benefit you got in the quarter, do you think that that kind of trend is something we should be looking for going forward? I think in the Q&A here you\u2019ve said that on an operating margin basis, you expect wine margins to remain relatively stable beyond the next few months. And then secondly, as you look at your wine share outlook which is a little below where it had been, how are you thinking about addressing those share trends? Are you okay with underperforming the category? Do you intend to spend more to try to pick up those trends? Just help us with your thinking there. Bob Ryder : So I will take the first half of that, Mark, and I will let Rob handle the second half. So on COGS I would say that there's probably some anomalous activities in fiscal \u201915, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue. Now what I would expect -- as I said earlier I would expect margins in wine to be higher at the end of fiscal \u201815 than they were at the end of fiscal \u201914. We\u2019re not giving guidance for fiscal \u201816 but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a lot of margin expansion going forward. The wine market share question? Rob Sands : Yeah, I think consistent with what Bob just said, no, we don't like losing a small amount -- even a small amount of market share and we have a lot of plans in place around innovation, around NPV, around concentrating our spend against higher growth elements of our portfolio which we think will address that. Largely however without spending a lot more money and I think consistent with what Bob said, also important is that we maintain wine margins, we don\u2019t want to see deterioration in that segment of the business either. So we will implement basically plans and programs that will drive the top line but not necessarily increase spending and therefore hurt margins. So we intend to take a balanced approach in that regard but we definitely don't like and don't want to lose share.  Now if you look at our wine, spirits segment, okay, first of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations and that's a real positive in the business and we\u2019re looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it\u2019s performing so well for us at the current time. And on the wine side, we had a couple of, I\u2019d say, somewhat anomalous things that had impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year. Even though it\u2019s not a very significant piece of our business, it was just soft. That geography was so devastated by everything that happened, we lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market which did affect the top line but really didn\u2019t have any effect on the bottom line because it\u2019s just commodity bulk wine business and it was business that frankly just don't even want to continue doing and that affected the top line a bit. And then in the US, we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we will be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact but again on trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it but we\u2019re going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line. Mark Swartzberg : And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the cash return thinking, Bob \u2013 Bob Ryder : And by the way, just on that note, I am reminded that we did have a pretty significant negative translation impact in Canada due to currency but as you are well aware that is largely accounting as a consequence of the strong dollar and the weak Canadian dollar, and that business being a largely domestic business. Mark Swartzberg : And maybe this is a follow up for Patty or Bob, and on that, Rob, if we take Canada and we take Eastern Europe, we take the bulk wine, can you put those together and tell us some sort of overall, if you will, temporary revenue adverse impact? Bob Ryder : You know, forex was worth about a percent, international was worth about a percent. So that would turn wine I guess from a negative 4 to a negative 2. Mark Swartzberg : And what about the bulk wine impact? Bob Ryder : That was probably less than a percent. Mark Swartzberg : And then on cash return, you\u2019ve said just now to Tim, outlook for \u2013 the guide for fiscal \u201816 for clarity on your dividend intentions, could we think about the fiscal \u201916 view as a more total view on cash return, including any potential for repo? Bob Ryder : We\u2019re still assessing that, Mark. So we will talk about -- more about that in April. Operator : Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Two questions. One is pricing in beer; were you able to get pricing to cover the increased costs that you get with that inflation pricing from ABI when they sell you product? That\u2019s the first question. How does pricing look right now for you and for the rest of the industry as best you can tell? And secondly, what happened to advertising and marketing spend in the quarter? Was it up or down for both segment if you could just highlight that? I am wondering as you go to fourth quarter for marketing, what activity you\u2019d have around NFL because I guess the big brands do a lot around SuperBowl. So would that affect the trend of this 8% depletions, the fact that you are heading into a time of heavy big brand marketing? Bob Ryder : So on beer pricing as we talked most of the category pricing happens happens in the fall and I think that, that pretty much progressed on plan. We aren't necessarily correlating pricing to our ABI inflation. We\u2019re at a higher level there. And you can see what's happening in the category in pricing if you look at IRI, if you look at Nielsen, regarding marketing, there\u2019s some timing. So beer marketing is up every quarter, it's up year-over-year. For this quarter, marketing as a percentage of sales in beer probably came down. That being said, to your point, we are \u2013 NFL is one of our heaviest properties for advertising. So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up but we feel that that more than pays for itself as you can see with the results on the top line.  For wine and spirits, we\u2019re also increasing marketing. In the third quarter we increased it and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said mostly around our already successful focus brands, really slimmed-down version of focus brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that, that have been very successful and we\u2019ve seen positive response and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands, we\u2019re just working right. I mean certainly in beer we\u2019re growing well ahead of the category and wine didn\u2019t have the greatest quarter. But we're still investing in the brands and those brands have had very good results and have responded pretty well to the marketing investments. Caroline Levy : Do you have a number on the beer side for what base Corona grew, your main brand and what on-premise looked like? Bob Ryder : So Corona has been pretty consistent. Corona Extra has been growing nicely in the low single digits and I'd say as far as channels, the total on premise for beer has -- is negative, it's been shrinking. But we're gaining share in that channel. I'd say total on-premise we\u2019re growing low single digits as well. All our brands are but a lot of that is Corona. Caroline Levy : Thank you. My final question is on margins. The decline we saw in Crown in the third quarter was high SG&A. That doesn\u2019t seem like that would get smaller, that\u2019s going to ramp up as you get more independent. And until your glass costs begin to offset that, which is maybe a year out, should we then expect to the flattish margins in beer for a period of time? Bob Ryder : I mean what we've said, this year we\u2019ve given a 32% operating profit guidance which is up about a 100 basis points off last year's, I\u2019ll call it kind of comparable, right, because we had a lot of activity last year, I would \u2013 we\u2019re not -- we haven't finished our own internal fiscal \u201816 look but we\u2019ve given guidance for the total beer segment, that will get up in the mid 30%, I would probably expect that to be more backend loaded as the total brewery and the additional furnaces come online more so like fiscal \u201917, fiscal \u201918 kind of timeframe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Just a couple of quick questions. First on the wine side, as you look out to calendar \u201915, do you think that you can catch up with the category with kind of the new products, marketing, what have you and do you think the category will rebound? I mean are you seeing other things where we\u2019re kind of maybe at a new normal level for growth? Rob Sands : The change in growth rate in the category is pretty minor and sort of this is within the range that it can fluctuate up, it could fluctuate down. It\u2019s actually kind of difficult to even know exactly where the category is growing because such a large percentage of it is really not even tracked and is therefore estimated. So when we talk about category growth it's an estimate. And I think that certainly we could see the category rebound to the previous levels of growth because we\u2019re really talking about 100 basis points one way or the other.  And then as it relates to us, yes, I think we can catch up. We\u2019ve got a lot of plans in place and it's really new products and new SKUs, new packaging that's one avenue that I think that will be more successful and as we move into next year because a lot of things that we put in place take some time to work albeit this year they were somewhat below our expectations. I think that nevertheless we've done some very positive things that position ourselves well for next year. And then we\u2019ve got a lot of plans relative to our existing big brands and I think will drive growth as we go into next year as well. So yes, I think we can catch up. Bill Chappell : And then to the beer, just back to the currency question, is there a way just to quantify in the most recent quarter what the peso I guess or what kind of impact it had on beer margin profits? Bob Ryder : Not really. That's getting down in the weeds. Bill Chappell : But was it meaningful or just not something we can disclose? Bob Ryder : Not tremendously because remember we have a lot of this hedge out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : First question, could you give us a little color on how Pacifico and Victoria are doing, how much were depletions up for those two brands and how the distribution on those look at this point? Bob Ryder : I mean they are growing, they are gaining share. Specifically Pacifico is our largest draft account and we\u2019re being aggressive on the draft expansion and the marketing and sales guys in beer are very confident around Pacifico, it has enormous distribution opportunity and has a unique brand personality which we\u2019re just beginning to advertise. So both of those brands we\u2019re growing low to mid single digits and we would expect that to continue into the future. Robert Ottenstein : And roughly what percentage of -- if Corona is a 100%, what percentage of the accounts at this point have Pacifico and Victoria? Bob Ryder : Pacifico, maybe if Corona is a 100%, maybe 20%, Victoria half of that. Robert Ottenstein : Half that? Bob Ryder : Yes, Victoria, for the full year, Victoria we might sell like 2 million case or something but it\u2019s growing very very fast. But we also think that look, right now consumers are very focused on authenticity and Victoria is probably the most -- it's probably the oldest most authentic Mexican brand out there. So we think that will really resonate with consumers as we really start to grow that brand and focus on it. Robert Ottenstein : And then second question, you may have referenced in the SG&A line to incremental costs as you have to put them on, as you win yourself away from ABI, can you give us a sense of how much those costs were in the quarter? And is that kind of the right run rate going forward or is that going to continue to step up and any sense about how much upside there may be to those numbers if they do have to go up? Bob Ryder : I would say that -- I would expect that to continue to ramp up because we have to build our own purchasing department, our own engineering department. Even from a commercial perspective you\u2019re going depletions 8%, right, you\u2019re going to have to invest more in your sales infrastructure, your marketing infrastructure. So I would expect those to continue to increase. Now on top of that we also have inflation which was contractual from InBev around our finished goods supply and our raw material supply. So we can\u2019t really give numbers on that but there is a lot of moving pieces but I\u2019d say if we move up in altitude, we still expect our beer segment to get to industry-leading operating profit margins when a lot of these moving pieces sell down. Robert Ottenstein : And then just final question, I think there was some reference to increased investment in spirits. Is that referring to possible additional acquisitions in the spirits area and perhaps could you give us a sense of what kind of areas that if that's the case would make sense? Rob Sands : No, we don't have any acquisition plans in the spirits category at the moment. And when I talked about more investments, it was really against our brands that we already have. We do have plans for new line extensions, new flavors etc. and because the spirits business is growing so well that gives us the opportunity to invest more behind the growth in the existing brands. So that's basically what I was referring to, Robert. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company. Vivien Azer : My first question has to do with the Modelo brand. You mentioned that it currently has about a 60% ACV in IRI channels. Can you offer a point of comparison and where that was a year ago, or two years ago? Bob Ryder : Probably it\u2019s been growing mid single digits. So now what I will say on Modelo Especial, it\u2019s expanding distribution, yes but it's also growing what I\u2019ll call per capita consumption. So in cities, take Los Angeles where it\u2019s very well established with the Hispanic consumer, it continues to grow even where it is. So it's got both, I\u2019ll say per cap consumption opportunity and expansion opportunity. Vivien Azer : Understood. On the wine side of the business, are there any other opportunities to exit lower margin businesses like you did with the bulk wine? Rob Sands : There is always opportunities to exit lower profit businesses but I would say that other than our normal SKU rationalization process, we don\u2019t have any big plans for that. Bob Ryder : We don't have an enormous exposure to the, I\u2019ll say, under $5 at retail, we have maybe two or three significant brands down there and I will say they are a strong part of the portfolio and by and large they have pretty good margin profiles. But if opportunities cropped up, or if we feel that\u2019s the right thing to do we pursue it. But I wouldn\u2019t say we have any huge plans right now to do that. Rob Sands : And also interestingly enough a lot of our sort of what constitutes that low end portfolio is a lot of our legacy stuff and actually as a consequence has pretty high ROIC as we look at the portfolio. So we factor all that into our decision-making as to whether we\u2019re going to keep going with various things or not even though they may be not a 100% on strategy because there's a premium. So we\u2019ve got some dessert wines, we\u2019ve got some products that toss your wines that aren\u2019t 100% within our portfolio strategy today but actually represent or generate very high ROIC because of the legacy nature of the products. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, thanks for taking the questions, and two really quick ones. The first is, with the integration of the tequila business now behind you, can you remind us what the growth and EBIT margin gap is between spirits versus wine? I'm just wondering if the outsized growth in the spirits business impacts your ability to reinvest in the wine business or works against you? So that's question number one. And then question number two. You've only got, I guess, six weeks, seven weeks left in the quarter. And so as you go into 2016, I'm wondering -- I know you haven't given us any guidance on the beer business but do you think inventory levels will kind of have trued up and be where they ought to be as you go into 2016 so we ought to have a closer match for depletions versus shipments? That would be helpful. Thanks so much. Bob Ryder : Sure. So I will handle those, they\u2019re kind of financial \u2013 so spirits in total has very similar economics to wine as far as margins. Tequila specifically for us, now it's very small number of cases, we expect it to grow but it's very small. But it is at the higher price points \u2013 it will be by far the highest price point within our spirits portfolio. So it will have a better margin profile but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to move the needle because it is so small in the near-term. And we don't -- we will look at wine and spirits similarly and they both have very healthy margins that can afford reasonable amount of marketing and sales investments against them.  If I turn to beer inventories, I\u2019d say we saw a pretty big increase in our distributors\u2019 inventories in the third quarter as they get closer to replenish to historic levels. We will most likely see that continue into the fourth quarter but we expect them to be at a pretty good back to normal trends by the end of the fourth quarter. So then we would expect as we go forward for more like shipments and depletions to be more in line with each other as we enter fiscal \u201816 and beyond.  End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. Needless to say we are very pleased with our fiscal 2015 year-to-date results. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the significant growth of this business. We\u2019re growing EBIT in our wine business and our spirits business gained share across the product portfolio. And during our next quarterly call which is scheduled in early April, we will provide guidance for our upcoming fiscal year.

And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty and good morning everyone. Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, I would like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that our board of directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly common stock cash dividend for the first time in the history of our company. This milestone is of particular significance because it reflects the confidence that we and our board of directors have in our ability to execute against growth opportunities, invest in our businesses and generate free cash flow that could be returned to you, our shareholders. It is the collective strength of our businesses that has abled this action and demonstrated by the impressive results achieved by the company in fiscal 2015. Since the acquisition of our beer business almost two years ago, we have had no shortage of milestones. We emerged as the number one multi-category player in alcoholic beverages and we are committing significant investment to our world class brewery in Mexico and our key [ph] beer brands continue to achieve outstanding growth and garner accolades for their quality. For example, six of our wine and spirits brands and three of our beer brands won Impact's Hot Brands award for 2014 as announced in early March. Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. So now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award winning handcrafted super-premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. More recently, we hired our new Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination on the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. In addition, Bill is accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team. One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multifaceted long-term, glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players, which included the formation of a 50 :50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate, and expand the Nava glass plant. The acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterrey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process, while securing future supply of materials and approved margins on finished products. Now the commercial side of our business continued to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015, outperforming the U.S. beer industry key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands\u2019 beer business was the number one contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015, while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015. I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business. Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship Corona Extra brand is the best selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top five beer brands in the U.S. to achieve growth last year with volume trends for this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum. In fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships, and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. According to GuestMetrics, during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continues to be the number one selling imported beer in the off-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand activations in on premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans, as this format currently represents less than 3% of total sales for Corona Extra. Last year, we represented another record setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine, or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the number two imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which has nearly doubled the share for this brand just five years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include increased media and general market advertising, continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada, on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion, and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our two biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples. Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015 hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light Draft and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national Draft footprint with recent launches in eight additional markets. We are also re-launching Corona Light cans supported with redesigned secondary packaging which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light Cerveza. Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chesney which has been a great asset for this brand. Victoria has become third best selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we are excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional periods. Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2016. As you can see we have tremendous opportunity to growth the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result for our beer business in fiscal 2016 we are targeting high single digit sales growth which exceeds U.S. beer industry and import trend estimates and is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range. From a brewery and operational perspective in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals relating to utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a budget and timing of completion perspective. The packaging area and high density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and waste water projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI for cans. The new joint venture management team has been established at the glass plant and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. As we begin fiscal 2016, we will be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational just more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellence support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs, as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015 we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increase operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better than expected results as well as our Canadian business which exceeded its financial goals for the year while growing share across all strategic product categories. Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mixed trend and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefits including reduced grape costs as well as positive impacts from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements. In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payments as our exclusive distributor contracts included in the selling structure that is just based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. In terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remained relatively flat. Now this compares to U.S. wines and spirits industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014. As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015 driven by the super premium priced segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and at the top of mind for our consumers in all key price segments. And we continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast growing wine brands including, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, Black Box, Nobilo and The Dreaming Tree. The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products and I am very proud to say that we received over 300 wine competition medals last year and 52 of our wines received 90 plus point ratings. This includes a 93 point score for Robert Mondavi Winery 2011 To-Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve in the Wine Enthusiast and a 90 plus rating for our Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro. And our list of achievements continues. Five of our brands made IRI's top 21 brands in 2014 including Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 Growth Brand Award including two spirits and 13 wine brands. And many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications including The Wall Street Journal, Food and Wine Magazine and Forbes.com, to name a few. Earlier I mentioned that six of our wine and spirits brands made to Impact Hot Brands list. It's important to note that this list includes well established brands such as Kim Crawford which has won eight years in a row and Black Box, which is celebrating its tenth consecutive win. It also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve. We experienced excellent sales growth of 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015 driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. The recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top five largest volume vodka brands that achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA's innovative flavors like strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple are driving current success and we look forward in seeing the results from our recent launch of our grapefruit jalape\u00f1o flavor. In addition, the success of Paul Masson peach brandy has exceeded our own expectations and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands. Overall, we gained IRI dollars share in imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness and trial of this brand in the coming months. As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see cross-promotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra which will help capture more merchandizing and floor space at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016 our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business while also growing revenue which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include, Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box, just to name a few. We remain committed to margin accretive innovation and new product development and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have a team dedicated to this process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area. We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We plan to improve sales execution and increase points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated and exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements are in place and will provide increased resources and improved performance metrics while enhancing wholesaler and retailer execution. For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. wine market. And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global bland management initiative, productivity improvements and lower grape cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. In closing, in fiscal 2015 we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board for volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better than expected results. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on the success achieved in fiscal 2015 as we head into the New Year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results. Bob Ryder : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth. Expanded our operating margins in both segments for consolidated comparable basis operating margin increase of more than 200 basis points and established some all time highs with consolidated EBIT reaching $1.6 billion, up nearly 30%. Comparable basis diluted EPS up more than 35% to $4.44, and operating cash flow up more than 30% while crossing the $1 billion mark. We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBIT and EPS growth while continuing to invest in our world class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint. In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resultant capital allocation flexibility, we are very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24% which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Consolidated organic net sales on a constant currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season. Pricing benefits helped beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make whole payment associated with the planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume, lower non-branded net sales and higher promotional spend. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from the consolidating of beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition, as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher margin beer business and beer pricing, favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement. I would like to note that we have included gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosures in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our Web site. SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $66 million, primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3 we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares to a 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter. Now let\u2019s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in a $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus a 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9%. Volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continued to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results. Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. For fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion. For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plant expansions. This activity is timing related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective. As you will see in our press release, we have provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects. Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-single digit volume growth, high-single digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given that fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single digit range. A result that would continue to be far outpace the import category and the total beer industry. Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we are projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth. For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single digit range and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits. Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted this represents a significant milestone in our history. Returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits business. We are initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. And for fiscal 2016, we are anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments. We ended fiscal '15 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1 times. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted three to four times leverage range during fiscal '16. Operating within our targeted leverage range combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program. In closing, I would say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We are a leader in growing in profitable consumer categories that are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positive consolation. And we have minimal exposure to emerging markets. In wine and spirits we continue to expect mid single sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016. We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line but we have put in a lot of effort against this area as reflected in our guidance. Longer-term, we anticipate continued strong category growth and we expect to at least maintain market share. In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry leading sales growth and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We are on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build out which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2016. Our beer business generates very strong margins and the very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast. In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft formats and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : A couple of quick questions from me. Bob, can you just clarify, you talked about other issues that affected the price fix number in beer. I just was hoping you could provide a little bit more clarity on exactly what that was? And then the second question on the capital allocation. When you talk about taking up the dividend, is this more about growing in line with earnings or do you ultimately see a payout ratio getting towards the higher end of your peer group, which is, I think, around 45% or so? And then the third question -- sorry for the multiple questions -- is on wine. What specific initiatives should we be looking at or for to really see the wine volume momentum turn from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters? Bob Ryder : Sure, Nik. So on the first question, it was a little bit garbled but I think you are asking about Q4 pricing and Q4 beer margins. Essentially what happened it was really just a timing thing because of -- the big piece was -- because of the Corona recall and we got fully reimbursed from InBev for that activity. That just caused some anomalies as to how we account for that and the difference between what happens in sales and what happens in volumes. And then there was another reclass that happened in the fourth quarter. So what I would do is, I would just look at the full year numbers which would be more reflective of the real price volume relationship. For the second question on the dividend. We are just starting out. I think we are very happy, for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend. And I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where peers are and part of that is the fact that we are still right around the four times EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect that to come down very fast, but we thought we would start out a little slow. I would say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS and in future years we may actually assess where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout range. Right now we are at the lower end, but certainly we have room to go to the higher end of that range. The third question which is more around wine volumes, I will let Rob answer. Rob Sands : Yes. Hi, Nik. Wine volumes, you know basically, Nik, we have got a lot of programs that we have put in place for our fiscal 2016 to drive, I will say better wine volume growth. And in particular, we have got some increased marketing against key brands. We have been increasing marketing. We have been doing a lot of research on exactly what kind of marketing will get us the best results, and we are implementing some new programs that we are very optimistic will in fact drive more sales growth in fiscal 2016 against key brands, and that\u2019s the whole portfolio versus 2015. We have got lot of new programs around activation in the marketplace and sales execution to drive points of distribution as well as increased merchandizing display and other activity at retail around our brand, so a lot of programs that we have put in place as we moved into this year and I would say we are pretty optimistic that we will meet our top line goals. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So, just two related questions just to clarify on the guidance for fiscal '16. One is, if you look at the margin guidance in beer, Bob, you've got -- you're beginning to incur some of the operating expenses and expensing the expenses related to the brewery expansion. So you've got the can line in, you'll have more of the capacity, I guess, beginning to be tested and such. So could you just dimensionalize for us a little bit how much expense there is? How it's affecting the margins, and maybe how long we'll have that dynamic where there's some expenses related to the start up that really don't have revenues attached to them? Bob Ryder : Yes, sure. So a good question Bryan. So, we experienced a little bit of this in the fourth quarter. As you bring these big lines on, a bunch of things happen. First, they start to depreciate. These are brand new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you are testing them, right of the bat and this lasts for quite a while, you are not getting very good yields nor are you getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses. Right. So it takes a while when these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And as we look at beer margins in '16, there is actually \u2013 there are some big movers. Right. I mean we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we will be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers. That\u2019s a positive. Another reasonably big positive is foreign exchange. But offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor costs as you have these startup expenses and you are bringing on labor ahead of the time that you are actually getting a lot of usable product from those new production lines. So they are kind of the big offsetting things. That being said, we are pretty happy that we finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around 32% in beer. And we are anticipating 100 basis point improvement even though we have got a lot of these new big production lines coming on stream. So we are pretty happy with that guidance. Bryan Spillane : Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just sneak in, the guidance range at $4.70-$4.90, as I was just kind of quickly plugging numbers in I was trying to figure out how you get to the high end of the range? Because it seems like you can get to the middle pretty easily given sort of the revenue and the margin guide you've given. So is the high end of the range basically really going to be more predicated on how well sales do relative to your guidance, meaning be at the high end or above? Or is the high end of that guidance range more tied to some of the margin expansion? Bob Ryder : Yes, I think it's probably -- look we are a consumer product company so the way we would like to get it is through sales that are higher than we anticipate. And generally that\u2019s what drive the bus on a consumer product P&L. So I would probably say the higher end of the guidance would be coming through the higher end of the guidance on our sales guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Bob Doctor : Hi, this is Bob Doctor standing in for Dara. I just have two questions. First, on the long-term volume expectations for the beer business. You recently communicated a goal to distributors of roughly doubling the business by 2024 which implies a healthy 6% 10-year CAGR. I was just curious, is this a real target investors should be focused on or more of a pie in the sky number you threw out to distributors? And then second, if you could just provide some updated color on the U.S. beer pricing environment which has decelerated a bit? And then specific to your pricing strategy, is the plan really more geared towards relative pricing gaps or has strong volume growth really emboldened you guys to take more of an absolute approach? Thanks. Bob Ryder : Yes, Bob. On the first question, I will answer a bit of it and then I will let Rob answer as he know more about the industry than I do. When we provided our updated capital spending guidance earlier this year, we did provide some medium term volume guidance which actually was driving the need to expand the brewery right from a 20 million or 25 million hectoliters. I think at that time we said the medium term volume guidance was mid-single digits, right. So I think your number was probably consistent. And that being said, next year's depletion guidance is more like 8% so it's higher than that. So that was kind of medium term. I think that brought us through fiscal '17, fiscal '18. For longer-term industry discussion, I will hand it over to Rob. Rob Sands : Yes. I think the answer to your question is it's definitely not pie in the sky. I would say that doubling the business over the next ten years is based on what we think is going to happen in the beer market and in particular how imports are going to continue to grow and then how our portfolio is going to continue to grow based on what we see or know is going to happen with the Hispanic demographic group and the growth of LDAs in that group. We think that doubling the business over the next ten years is certainly a doable number. I won't say that we got so detailed in our distributor meetings as to exactly how that\u2019s going to occur, i.e. organically or otherwise. But of course over the next ten years we are going to have to have new products, new packaging, new SKUs etcetera, to keep the growth of the portfolio as it is. Plus obviously, as Bob pointed out, we are starting out ahead of where we need to be CAGR wise to achieve that. So I think we feel pretty optimistic that that is a very achievable goal and number. Bob Ryder : And the Bob as far as the pricing comment, look beer is a local business. So we look at pricing differently by geographic regions because we have different competitive dynamics in the different regions and different competitors take different pricing actions in the different regions. So we do pay attention to the momentum we have in those individual regions. What is our key price gaps to our key competitors in those regions and we kind of make decisions in those individual geographic regions and that kind of roles up to the more macro number which you would see reflected in IRI or Nielson. Operator : Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : My first question is just a little bit more clarification on what happened in the fourth quarter on the wine business, because you had a pretty big gap in terms of shipments underperforming depletion? And then you also called out the performance payments from the distributors, which I think helped your revenues or margins. So can you just talk about some of the underlying trends, if you strip out, number one, just the gap between shipments and depletions and then the distributor performance payments? Bob Ryder : Yes. In the fourth quarter is where we make certain adjustments basically in our shipments to distributors to make sure that shipments do in fact equal depletions. So there can't be imbalances in the fourth quarter that are not necessarily reflective of the whole year. So I think you really have to look at the whole year as opposed to quarter-to-quarter because there can't be anomalies in the timing of shipments versus depletions. We also have some interruption in the international businesses as a result of the Russian and this and that, but I think that basically when you look at the whole year this was pretty immaterial. What was your second question, Judy? Judy Hong : The performance payments, sorry, to quantify the performance as you had called out? Bob Ryder : Yes. So also in connection with our distributor agreements and specifically in the fourth quarter of every year this is where we sort of look at, where our distributors have come in versus the goals that were agreed upon and set. And then there are payments that are made in the fourth quarter that can actually go either way based on our distributors achievements of KPIs. And key performance indicators in those KPIs are things like sales mix, distribution, for example. So in the fourth quarter they went our way last year and thus, again, that causes some, I will say sort of quarter-to-quarter anomalies. I think fundamentally you have to look at the whole year. Judy Hong : Okay. And then, Bob, I just wanted to follow-up on the capital allocation question and this is really more 2017 type of questions. But as you think about CapEx, obviously stepping down, your free cash flow stepping up pretty meaningfully and the natural deleveraging effect that it has in your business given the EBITDA growth and your leverage targets. So how do you think about really levering up the balance sheet to either buy back stock at a more aggressive manner versus your free cash flow generation or even paying the dividend? Bob Ryder : Yes. I mean that\u2019s a good problem to have as you know. And we are looking forward to fiscal '17 and depending on what's going on in the marketplace, my guess is we will probably increase the dividend at least with how comparable net income increases. And as I said earlier, we have the opportunity to go higher in that 25% to 30% payout ratio range. And I would probably anticipate that we reinvigorate our stock buyback program. We still have about $700 million authorized by the board and as you know right before the beer deal, in the previous like 12 to 18 months, we had bought back about 20% of our outstanding shares just under $20 a share. So that\u2019s worked out pretty well for us. But I think it will be a combination of those two. And I would presume that various tuck-in acquisitions in the beverage alcohol category might also come up. But as you said, as you look at the numbers, the free cash flow generation when we get past this real high tranche of capital spending, is really significant for our business. So we have a lot of flexibility on how to reinvest that cash. And I would presume that a reasonable amount of it would go back to shareholders. Judy Hong : Okay, thanks. And then, if I just can squeeze in one last question. Bob, the glass sourcing in 2016, can you give us a little bit of clarification in terms of what portion of your volume will come from various arrangements? So the JV, the Vitro, the O-I arrangement you have in Waco. So just kind of rough breakdown of those relationships? Bob Ryder : Yes. I would rather not get real specific on that but what I would reiterate is, our least expensive source of glass is the facility that\u2019s right next to our brewery. Right now it has one furnace that\u2019s operating. We have begun building furnace number two and its planned to go up to four furnaces. And they kind of come in over the next four years. So almost like one a year comes in, right. So that volume will shift from other third party suppliers to that local supplier. And when it gets up to a total of four furnaces, it would be capable of providing roughly half of our needs in glass. So that\u2019s kind of how it's going to play out. The good news is that we are happy that we have landed that joint venture and we are thrilled with our JV partner. Owens-Illinois has already exhibited quite a bit of expertise in operating these glass facilities and then tend to think very much like us, so there is no disagreements unlike some other joint ventures that we might recall. And the other providers are also quite professional and quite good at what they do and the good news is that in the total glass industry glasses is not a growing industry, we are growing our glass business. So we are favored partner. So I think it's a very good partnership between us and all our glass suppliers. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Rob, as you think about your outlook on wine, how would that reconcile with your outlook on the overall wine industry and where do you see the best growth, the pockets of growth, within the overall wine segments and price points in 2016? Rob Sands : Yes. Tim, we think that the wine industry in general in 2016 is going to grow sort of low single-digits in volume, couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars. So volume 1% to 2%, dollars maybe 3% to 4%. Sort of consistently with what happened in 2015 depending on exactly what reports you are looking at. You are sort of looking at 1% volume growth in 2015 and again a couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars growth. In terms of where we are going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case which, there is I think pretty strong, continues to be a very strong premiumization trend. All the growth and more in actuality is occurring in the premium plus category. And probably the thing that it's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with the bottom of the premium segment, $5 and above. It moved up into what we call the super premium segment which is sort of that $8 to $10, meaning the growth. That\u2019s been very strong. And now we are seeing very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra premium and luxury, really, I would say a lot, you are going to see very strong growth in sort of that, almost $13 to $20 range you are probably going to see double digit growth. In terms of varietals, I think that you will see decent lower levels of growth in the most key varietals, i.e. chardonnay, cabernet, sauvignon. I think that Pinot Noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine you are going to continue to see very strong growth in Pinot Grigio and of course New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc I think are going to continue to be a very hot category. And then, I think another phenomena, or I won't quite call it a phenomena but a bit of a change in trend, is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines have become very hot once again, or I shouldn't say once again but again. They haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, five, six, seven, ten years. And you are seeing some of the more affordable categories in the sparkling wine like Prosecco and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot and I will say more every day. I mean people are turning to sparkling wines as an everyday product. What you don't see as particularly hot is champagne. i.e. French champagne. But I think that it's priced itself out of the market largely and the consumer has turned to I'll say more reasonably priced and easier to drink alternatives then champagne. So sweet reds will continue to be, I think a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust, slightly, when we talk about sweet reds, big, robust slightly sweeter, generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, Moscato has been kind of up and down a little bit. So it's probably going to continue favorably but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim. Tim Ramey : Good stuff. Bob, with regard to the construction costs and timing, I understand a lot of things like steel are dollar based, but are there peso based costs associated with the Nava facility and is that having a benefit to the overall estimate of costs there? Bob Ryder : Most of it, as you said, Tim, most of the machinery equipment are dollar based. Actually most of the commodities and production are dollar based. But the big local cost of course is Mexican labor. So Mexican labor being used on the construction will end up on the balance sheet, right. And that will come down and price of that will be good but it's not a huge percentage of the cost and same thing on operations. Mexican labor in the plant and in the glass plant, right. Because we employ a lot of people down there and it's growing kind of geometrically. And as long as the dollar stays stronger than the peso, that will be a bit of a benefit as well. But the good news is because our end selling price in beer is based in U.S. dollars, we are not very foreign exchange exposed which is a great place to be, right. Because you remember Australian wine for those years when the Aussie dollar got so strong, it's very hard to maintain a good gross profit margin. So we are balanced in the currency of our input cost and the currency of our selling price which is just a really good long place business model. It's a good place to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I have two questions. Just the first in terms of what you're seeing in grape cost inflation or deflation this year and then what you expect the overall impact would be on your segments margins? And then my second question, looking at your smaller brands in your beer segment, you mentioned some new initiatives for your Victoria brand, but can you provide a little bit more color on what you're doing for your Pacifico brand? Thanks. Bob Ryder : Sure. I can take the first one on grape. So we are actually doing very well on our grape cost. We had a very good year in fiscal '15 and I take my hat off to our operations guys in the wine business. The wine makers blending the wine and the guys in charge of sourcing the grapes and farming the grapes. Because we did a very good job buying wine and the landed cost per ton is kind of flat to even down a little bit. And we have done a very good job on refining our wine blends to make the cost to the consumer a little bit less. So we're looking good on the wine side which is why, one of the big reasons why we said we expect to maintain the improved gross profit margins that we experience in the wine segment in 2015. The question around Victoria Pacifico, I will let Rob answer. Rob Sands : Yes. So Victoria is one of the -- Pacifico, I will start with that, is one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually thing that it's a real sleeper and it's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial explode as a brand. Pacifico, primarily West Coast, primarily Southern California, is it's really big base of business. We are focusing our marketing around things like the World Surfing Championship. We have got advertising campaigns in place around basically discovered by surfers in Mexico, in Baja. And we have got a draft program for Pacifico which has been, I would say very well received. So a smaller brand in the portfolio but something with a lot of potential. Victoria, again a small brand but the interesting thing about Victoria is that they are the largest brand in Mexico with a 15% market share and is very well known by the Hispanic, Mexican Hispanic consumer, which really gives it a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico, from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products or one or two that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria we have also introduced cans. We are expanding the distribution nationally and we are seeing some pretty strong growth as I commented on initially, 60% growth on that brand in last year. And we see that momentum remaining strong into this year. I mentioned just in general cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us across all of our brands. Corona, Modelo Especial as well as the other brands. We are really stepping up can introduction. And an interesting trend in the beer business in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as so premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably have been driven by the fact that the craft portion of the business which is the other very first growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted at a very high end cans as their primary packaging. And the consumer has really accepted that. So that's really kind of opened the window to make cans a great premium package for our business. And when you look at our business for cans, we have not been in cans at all. Cans represent approximately 3% of our total business but if you look at the industry as a whole, it's like half of the beer business is in cans. So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business and in our own particular case, as we have introduced cans we have really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging. Because we haven't had packaging that, I will say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : I'd just like to dig into the D&A situation because it's going to be such a big factor as you bring on capacity. It would be incredibly helpful, Bob if you could, number one, tell us what the impact of expensing D&A was in the fourth quarter, for example, and in some way frame whether you can give us the actual number that you're expecting for FY '16? Or maybe say that it's certainly not going to be as big as the benefit from your glass savings? But what I'm worried about is at some point we hear that the D&A alone is offsetting all the benefits of the volume growth and so on. But if you could help us get comfortable with that, that would be really helpful. Bob Ryder : So, good question Caroline. So, look, our D&A is going up right, because we are spending all this capital, obviously. So in fiscal '16, our D&A is probably going to go up 20% to 25% over fiscal '15 and that\u2019s because we are bringing on these new production lines and actually towards the end of the year we actually bring on some hectoliters of beers. So as that stuff goes into servers, you start appreciating it. So that does create P&L headwinds, right, as you go forward. But even with all that, as we discussed, we are estimating that our operating profit margin of beer segment is up about 100 bps next year and we are still reiterating the fact that we expect to get to the mid 30% range by the time the 20 million hectoliters is built out. Caroline Levy : Thanks. And just to clarify, you've also very carefully figured out what the inefficiencies of testing the lines and so on does to you because, again, this is very new for you guys but we do sometimes hear our margins are going to be hit by the inefficiencies of opening a new brewery and you obviously wouldn't be at full capacity for a little bit? Bob Ryder : Yes. I mean the good news, and again we are quite anomalous in this regard, because it's not like we are building the brewery capacity utilization from organic growth. We are moving the production from InBev to us. So although we won't be bringing the line up to the maximum capacity utilization that it is now, it will be still be better than what you might see in other industries as they build, say a Greenfield facility and it takes them, say, ten years to get up to full capacity utilization. We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things and as you know, our brewery is highly automated. So there is a lot of software IT stuff going on. And every line you can't necessarily anticipate the gremlins that will come up. So we are doing everything we can to offset that. But stuff happens but we don\u2019t think that that will in any way material and it would be relatively short lives. And we are not expecting that to happen but it can. But that\u2019s all reflected in the guidance that provided for fiscal '16. Caroline Levy : That's great. And then if I could just understand in terms of the last two quarters in beer, your margins were actually down a little bit in the last two quarters. What was driving that? Was it the D&A? And then in the first half of the year, do you expect more of that or can we look for margins to be up consistently in fiscal '16? Bob Ryder : Yes. Again, to Rob's comment earlier, I am not going to go crazy on quarters because it's kind of timing and stuff happens. But Caroline the margins to which you are referring, are they gross profit margins or operating profit margins? Caroline Levy : I was looking at EBIT margins, looked like they were down a little bit in each of the last two quarters in beer. Bob Ryder : Yes. So the big reason for that is kind of ramped up marketing spend, will be the big reason for that. You know in our beer business, we have increased our marketing spend in fiscal '14, it was about 8% of sales. And we went up to about 8.5% of sales in fiscal '15, right, as we got into general market advertising for Modelo Especial. Got a little more aggressive against Corona in the face of the glass recall because we wanted to completely negate any potential brand equity loss that we had there and I think we were successful on that. And as Rob said earlier, we are ramping up some marketing around Pacifico. And we think that that\u2019s being a very effective spend and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume lift and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures. So that\u2019s the big reason why the operating profit might have come down a little bit. And then also the question Nik asked earlier, this anomaly in the fourth quarter because of the Corona glass recall and some other re-classes that also hurt the fourth quarter. And as long as we are on marketing spend, as Rob said earlier, we are also increasing our marketing spend in wine, right. Because we are a branded consumer product business and we think that\u2019s important to keep the consumer brand equity going across all our categories. Caroline Levy : Thank you. I have one last question. Can you quantify the payment on wine in the fourth quarter? The distributor payment? Bob Ryder : No, we are not going to get into that. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial. Mark Swartzberg : Couple of questions. First, also on the margin trends here in beer, Bob. Oil prices eventually should be a benefit to your shipping costs from Mexico here to the U.S. Can you just give us a flavor for how beneficial that's been and how beneficial that might be? Rob Sands : Yes. Good question. This is a kind of macro trend that you guys are probably seeing in a lot of companies. So net-net, even at this day, this is net good news for us because obviously we will benefit from the reduced oil prices on our, the unhedged portion of our oil exposure. And most of our oil exposure is around freight and there is more in beer than wine because they just ship more cases. So I would say oil prices is a net positive for us but when you guys get into the numbers you will see that we still had around $30 million loss on I will say, unrealized commodity hedges and most of those were around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next two years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16. That would have been included in our guidance. But net net, the reduction to oil prices, I will say from a fiscal '16, is a positive. And of course if they stayed low, it will be even more of a positive as these out of the money get behind us. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. And is it fair to think at the moment when you're bringing beer into the U.S. you're bringing some, so to speak, of your own beer from Nava and then some being purchased from ABI still. So the actual shipping cost for those two classes of beer, is there any difference? I mean we know that, obviously, as it gets into Nava it cuts closer to the U.S. but the actual kind of per-mile charge of getting it to a given location in the U.S. from a brewery that's owned by ABI versus a brewery that's owned by you, are they one and the same or is there some difference in that regard too? Bob Ryder : There is actually a reasonable amount of difference. Let's see, quantitative difference. There is a lot more miles that we travel in the U.S. than we do in Mexico, of course. But I will also say that they are very different freight negotiations south of the border and north of the border. So south of the border there is not as much competition around freight. And south of the border it's almost exclusively rail freight that we do and actually even north of the border most of our cost is rail freight as well. But I would say that they are very different competitive environments in Mexico versus the U.S. Mark Swartzberg : What I'm -- and maybe I'm not -- what I'm trying to get at is, once a product crosses the U.S. border, if it's coming out of Nava versus coming out of a brewery that's owned by ABI from a kind of landed in the U.S. perspective. Is the per-mile charge any different versus in those two classes, those two different barrels, so to speak? Bob Ryder : Not in the U.S. Mark Swartzberg : Not in the U.S. got it. Great. And then on the balance sheet, rates being where they are, one could make that argument that you should stay kind of in and around the upper end of that three to four range you have. You're at 4.1 now. Is it fair to think you want to stay close to four or how do you think about that? Bob Ryder : Yes. I mean our desired range would be in between three and four. We are trying to balance a lot of constituencies. Obviously the rating agencies would like us to be very low in that range and probably shareholders would like us to be high in that range because they presume that what we do is borrow money and give cash back to shareholders. So we are taking both into account. So the ideal is in between three and four. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. Okay, last one on that. If we just think about M&A, you've commented on this a few times over the last few quarters. And, Rob, you made a comment that you are open to M&A in the beer business and certainly there could be some tuck-ins. But when we think about M&A in terms of sheer scale, whether it's beer or wine and spirits, how are you thinking about this scale of any acquisition you might do in terms of like the upper limit on such a transaction? Rob Sands : Yes, when we think about scale, we are really talking, I think, primarily about tuck-in brand type acquisitions in the couple of hundred million, probably range, or less. There just isn't, there isn't anything really big in any of the three categories that I will say ostensibly makes a lot of sense to us. So it's really just, I would say, opportunistic tuck-in brand type opportunities across the three categories. Operator : Your final question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : In terms of the draft business, we haven't talked about that too much today. Is the percent of your business in draft is about 2% to 3%, is that right? How much was it up last year and can you talk a little bit about what percentage of the potential accounts you have draft available now for Corona Extra and Corona Light, please? Bob Ryder : We continue to -- I will start off and then Rob can follow up -- we continue to be very bullish on draft. We feel that we can sell quite well into retailers because our brands can distinguish themselves from amongst the thousands of IPAs out there that are on draft handles that need not turn as fast as us. We think right now Corona Light is our biggest opportunity for draft and Corona pretty much is from a very small base, but doubled its draft volume in fiscal '15. As far as Corona extra draft, that\u2019s still in very small test right now. So the big push in on Corona Light. And I think Pacific is still probably our largest draft brands. But our brands really position themselves very well in draft accounts. Rob Sands : Yes. I mean I think the only thing that I would add is much like cans it represents it represents a relatively small percentage of our business and a relatively large percentage of the overall beer business. So it remains a big opportunity for us. We are being prudent in how we introduce draft for our biggest brand Corona extra to see how it impacts the brand where it's traditionally been only a glass on premise. So we are interested to see exactly what happens in those accounts where we put draft in. I think the results of our testing thus far has been that way we put draft even in high market share on premise, establishments, that it tends to be a market expanding as opposed to purely cannibalistic. So we think that that\u2019s a very positive trend. Of course everything that we do, we do it keeping in mind that we are not going to cannibalize higher margins with a lower margin business can. Draft is essentially the same kind of margin structure as our other package formats in general. So we are not overly concerned with it but on the other hand we certainly would -- we like the fact that it appears to be significantly market expanding when we put it in. We actually tend to see increased sales of glass in a surrounding area when we put draft, Corona extra draft into an establishment. And that\u2019s sort of been I think the traditional thinking on draft, is that it not only has just benefit from a pure substantive point of view, i.e. another format to consume the product, but it also has a marketing or advertising component that helps to sell your other packages off premise. And we are definitely seeing that. Robert Ottenstein : That's terrific. And then just on cans, can you give us a sense of where you are in terms of rolling out your can capacity. How much is in-house right now and how much do you -- what percentage do you rely on ABI and at what point will you be 100% in-house on cans? Rob Sands : Yes. So we are pretty much self sufficient on cans right now having put in our can capacity all ready. And we can produce pretty much as much in cans as we could possibly need. As I said, we are just rolling out a new can for Corona Extra. Corona Extra has been about, I think, 3% cans. So very huge opportunity. Our business overall, meaning everything to buying, is about 20% cans in a market that\u2019s I think closer to about 50% cans. So huge opportunity there and no capacity constraints whatsoever. And we can supply a hundred percent of our cans at this stage. So it's the year of the can. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would now like to turn the floor back to Mr. Rob Sands for any closing remarks. Rob Sands : Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. I would like to conclude by saying that we are extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal '15. And we are already hard at work to deliver the exciting opportunities we have before us in fiscal '16. I am particularly proud of the fact that we are initiating a dividend for the first time in the 70-year history of our company. This complements our efforts to continue to deliver shareholder value. As we have discussed in detail today, we remain committed to driving the growth of our business while continuing to invest in our brands and operations. Our next quarterly call will be scheduled for the beginning of July. In the meantime, we look forward to a very busy spring selling season. You can look for us as we kick up our Cinco de Mayo celebration by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. And as always, we hope you will enjoy our fine products for your own celebrations both big and small in the coming months. So, again, thank you for your participation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Constellation Brands\u2019 First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our new Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during today\u2019s Q&A session to two questions. We received Investor feedback last quarter indicating that the call ran long, because we allowed questioners to ask unlimited questions. So I would appreciate your cooperation. Thanks in advance, and now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty, and good morning. And welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter 2016 sales and earnings results. As Patty mentioned earlier, I am joined today by David Klein, Constellation\u2019s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, following the recent departure of Bob Ryder, who served as our CFO for the past eight years. Bob has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous and I wish him success in his future endeavors. We have an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we are expecting a seamless transition for David as he assumes his new role. David brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position, most recently serving as the CFO for Constellation\u2019s Beer business, where he was integral in orchestrating our glass sourcing strategy, implementing commodity management processes and instilling production costs management discipline at the brewery. David has also been very involved in the oversight of our Nava brewery build-out, which includes managing capital expenditures at the facility. Now during the past year working with the beer team David has divided his time between Rochester, Chicago, San Antonio and Mexico. I believe that many of you have had the opportunity to meet David and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. You will be hearing more from David in just a few minutes. Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss this morning\u2019s exciting announcement of Constellation\u2019s planned purchase of the Meiomi wine brand. Meiomi is predominantly a California pinot noir and represents a synergistic high-growth, high-margin accretive complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Launched in 2006, Meiomi sold about 60,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace in 2010 and has grown to become a nearly 600,000 case brand since then. It is currently the fastest growing major pinot noir in IRI channels at the $20 luxury price point and has experienced dollar sales growth of more than 50% over the last 52 weeks. In calendar 2014, Meiomi generated more than $65 million in net sales with an operating profit margin profile that significantly exceeds the margin rate of our overall Wine and Spirits business. The right brands with the right financial profile like Meiomi, Meiomi can be efficiently integrated into our distribution platform to provide synergies, scale and root-to-market benefits and it is very similar to our successful Mark West acquisition. As I have previously mentioned, tuck-in acquisitions has been identified as one of our capital allocation priorities, especially those that are strategic, synergistic, good value and meet our strict financial criteria. Meiomi is one of these acquisitions. This acquisition does not signal a change in strategic goals for the business or impact our ability to achieve our targeted leverage range. Our top priorities remained unchanged and they include reducing our debt to less than four times leverage. This creates significant capital allocation flexibility and opportunity to increase returns to our shareholder through dividend, growth and share buybacks. Capturing the organic growth opportunities we see across all of our product categories, completing the brewery and glass plant expansions as planned, while ensuring that we do not impact the tremendous commercial momentum we have within the U.S. beer markets and complementing our organic growth efforts and shareholder cash return focus with complementary brand acquisitions that enhance our portfolio. These priorities are intact and will remain our core focus for delivering shareholder value over the long-term. And now I would like to shift the focus of our discussion to our quarterly results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Overall, our Beer business had -- has been unstoppable, our Wine and Spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year and we continue to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery and glass plant expansions. During the first quarter the Beer business generated results that exceeded our expectations, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, during the first quarter, Constellation Beers delivered about two-thirds. That\u2019s two-thirds of the total U.S. beer industry volume growth. Leading volume gains among U.S. brewers for the eight consecutive quarter in IRI channel. So what\u2019s driving this phenomenal level of growth and momentum? We continue to experienced robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers, with our top five brands experienced -- experiencing solid growth across almost all channels and packaging sizes during the quarter. In addition, we are benefiting from strong sales execution and excellent ongoing support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing program that resonate with consumers, increase investment and enhanced media plan, continued distribution gains across the portfolio for our core brands and package types, and the expansion of product offerings like Corona Extra cans, Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft. The Beer business kicked up the 120 days of summer-selling season by posting market share gains during the Cinco de Mayo holiday led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial as the number one and number two share gainers respectively across all U.S. beer brands. The new Corona cans have been a hit with consumers. We dedicated significant media support behind the launch with English and Spanish language TV across the NBA playoff, Univision and Comedy Central. We see great opportunity with the can launch as this format currently represents only a small portion of total Corona Extra volume. Modelo Especial continues to maintain strong momentum as the number two imported beer in the U.S. and delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the first quarter. Modelo Especial launched its first ever national English language campaign with targeted programming including first round NBA playoffs on ESPN and TNT. This effort will continue into the summer. Corona Light draft expanded its launch with 28 new wholesalers in existing markets. We also activated the Kenny Chesney sponsorship during the quarter which will continue through September. And I\u2019m sure that many of you viewed our new jewel branded Corona Extra Casa Noble to kill a TV spot leading up to the Cinco holiday, which was aired on a variety of high profile TV programs. This advertisement drove new distribution of Casa Noble in select on and off premise accounts. Overall, the strong results of the Beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. As such, we now expect beer volumes to increase mid-to-high single digits which should drive net sales growth of approximately 10% and underlying operating income growth of 13% to 15%. Beer operations continue to run smoothly the brewery and glass plant expansions that are proceeding as planned. Our key performance metrics and initiatives for the brewery are on or better than target. The first incremental 5 million hectoliters of capacity is expected to become operational by the end of calendar 2015. During the first quarter, we achieved high levels of productivity and record capacity utilization at the Nava brewery and construction of the second furnace at the glass plant is underway. And we have begun site excavation and instillation of utilities for the previously announced incremental brewery capacity expansion from 20 to 25 million hectoliters. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the Beer business. Given the continued strength of this business, we are currently evaluating plans for our next increment of capacity beyond 25 million hectoliters. And now I would like to discuss the operational results for our Wine and Spirits business. During the first quarter, we experienced improving depletion in consumer takeaway transfer U.S. wine business, posted better than expected results in Canada and delivered excellent to our sales in depletion growth trends for our portfolio of spirit brands. We are benefiting from positive mix trends across the business. We gained share of feature and display activity at retail. And we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We successfully maintained margins for the Wine and Spirits business in the first quarter after delivering operating margin expansion of our 130 basis points in fiscal 2015. And we remain on track this year to maintain the expanded margin achieved last year. As outlined last quarter, one of our key strategic objectives for this year is the focus on our marketing efforts on a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scaled higher margins and the greatest growth potential. Now, let me give you a few examples of what we currently have underway. Black Box will be running two commercials chanting the exceptional value of this premium Box wine has to offer. The commercials air this summer and for the first time will run in the fall season as well. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi kicked off its Moments TV campaign in June and is expected to garner more than 1 billion LDA media impressions through year end. You can see the spot on channels like HDTV, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Food Network, TLC, Bravo, TBS and E! We\u2019ve created a new fully integrated digital advertising campaign for Clos du Bois, which is running now through the end of summer to engage consumers with this French inspired California wine. The quality of our wine brands has also attracted some terrific media attention this spring, with mentions of brands such as Black Box, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Robert Mondavi, Winery, Ruffino, the Dreaming Tree and our newest brand, Tom Gore Vineyards in such recognizable publications as Fortune.com, Wine Enthusiast, Bloomberg.com and E! Online. Recent ratings further attest to our portfolio strength, with 90 plus scores coming from the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator for luxury tiers of our Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Ravenswood brands. You may have noticed that beginning with the first quarter we\u2019ve changed the composition of our reported Focus Brands in order to better align this disclosure with our current brand priorities on the sales and resource focus for the Wine and Spirits business. We now have 15 brands that comprise our Focus Brands versus 20 brands previously. Notable additions include two of our innovation brands, The Dreaming Tree and Ultra Premium multi varietal wine, which was introduced about three years ago in collaborations with singer, songwriter, Dave Matthews and SAVED, a luxury brand inspired by contemporary artist, Scott Campbell who was perhaps known best as the tattoo artist to the Hollywood stars. And we experienced overall depletion growth of 3.5% for the first quarter, with our Focus Brands growing nearly twice of that rate. These results were driven by a number of our fastest-growing brands including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Estancia, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. For our spirits portfolio, we experienced excellent net sales growth of 8% and solid depletion trends in the first quarter, driven by Casa Noble Tequila, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and SVEDKA, VACA. Within IRI channels, our dollar sales growth in spirits continued to outperform the market during the quarter. Now before I turn the call over to David, I\u2019d like to provide some context for the cost effectiveness plans we have initiated as many of you -- as you may have seen mentioned in this morning\u2019s press release. As we transform our business, it\u2019s becoming increasingly important to evolve our organizational structure for sustainable long-term growth in a way that can bring out the best in the business today and at the same time position us to adapt quickly and effectively in responding the future business needs. As such, we have shifted resources and investments to long-term growth opportunities across the business as well as improved efficiency by consolidating and streamlining resources in areas where it makes the most sense. The position changes associated with this initiative will be minimal but the majority will occur within our Wine and Spirits business. The objective of this effort is to build the best organization that will enable us to be more agile and effective while unlocking growth potential. David will provide a financial overview of the program in a few minutes. In closing, I would like to reiterate that everything we do at Constellation Brands is guided by one of our most important strategic imperatives to apply rigorous financial discipline. And our financial discipline involves maintaining our commitment to our capital allocation priorities, which include ongoing debt reduction to less than four times leverage, potential share repurchases and dividend increases, and tuck-in acquisitions like Meiomi, Mark West, and Casa Noble. I would also like to remind everyone that during my tenure as CEO for the last eight years, our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our product portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of business assets in an effort to premiumize and grow the business. And my plan for the future is to continue to deliver value and generate growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for financial discussion of our first quarter results. David Klein : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I first want to say I am excited about my new role at Constellation. This is a stellar company with tremendous prospects in a dynamic industry. I believe Constellation offers one of the best combinations of topline growth and profitability in the beverage alcohol space. I look forward to partnering with Rob in the rest of the executive management team, as we remain focused on executing Constellation\u2019s strategic goals and our capital allocation priorities, as outlined by Rob earlier. I have had the pleasure of meeting members of the investment community at investor events in my previous roles as Treasurer or as CFO of our Beer business. I look forward to spending more time and building relationships with you going forward in my new role. With that, let me provide some Q1 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 18%. We paid out a quarterly common stock dividend for the first time in our history. And the continued robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business, along with our agreement to acquire the Meiomi wine brand, are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.10 to a range of $4.80 to $5 for fiscal '16. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q1 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 10%. Wine and Spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 4%. This primarily reflects higher shipment volume and favorable mix. Net sales benefited from the overlap of U.S. distributor inventory destocking net of a related distributor destocking payment, which occurred during first quarter fiscal 2015. For the quarter consolidated gross profit increased $68 million, up 10% with gross margin increasing 130 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $65 million primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. Beer gross profit margin increased nearly 2 percentage points to 49.2%. This was driven primarily by pricing and COGS favorability. Wine and Spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and mix benefits were affectively offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment. Gross margin held steady at 40.7% as the benefit from mix and favorable COGS were offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payments. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. Beer SG&A was up $16 million primarily due to the higher marketing spend. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $50 million and consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 170 basis points, while Wine and Spirits operating margin held fairly steady. Interest expense for the quarter was $78 million, down 10%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of March, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of $51 million since the end of fiscal 2015. I would like to take a moment here to note that we are currently in the process of revising our credit agreement to take advantage of the favorable market conditions to extend tenor and ensure our facility is appropriately sized and flexible given the recent growth of our business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% and compares to a 32.5% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by various favorable tax items. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. Now let\u2019s review free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter, we generated $76 million of free cash flow, compared to $101 million for Q1 of last year. Operating cash flow totaled $206 million versus $232 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments and overlap of the tax refund in Q1 FY15, partially offset by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter totaled $130 million, which was essentially even with Q1 last year. For fiscal \u201816, we still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal \u201916, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer. Before reviewing our fiscal \u201916 P&L outlook, let me provide a few financial comments related to the Meiomi transaction. We expect to finance the $315 million purchase price with borrowings under our credit agreement. We expect the transaction to close around the beginning of August and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to EPS for fiscal \u201916. We are only buying the brand, inventory and some great supply contracts, so we expect integration of the brand into our Wine and Spirits business to be seamless. Now let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal \u201916 P&L outlook. As mentioned earlier, as a result of the continued strong marketplace performance for our Beer business and the expected accretion benefit from Meiomi, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $4.80 to $5 versus our previous $4.70 to $4.90 range. The Beer business is now targeting mid to high single-digit volume growth, net sales growth of approximately 10% and 13% to 15% operating income growth. As a reminder, fiscal \u201915 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal \u201916 depletion growth rate to be above the shipment growth rate and therefore in the high single-digit range. We continue to project beer operating margin to expand and be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement, as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A structure. We expect out beer operating margin to fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year, as we start to bring additional brewery capacity online. During Q2, there will be an annual inflation increase under our Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for the finished beer that they are currently supplying us. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Our fiscal \u201916 comparable basis guidance, excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. These adjustments include approximately $20 million of anticipated costs associated with the cost effectiveness plan outlined by Rob earlier. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be reinvested in areas of the company that drive growth. We ended Q1 fiscal '16 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.9 times. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend, dividend payments and the funding of the Meiomi acquisition, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth have positioned us to be below the four times leverage range at the end of fiscal '16. Operating below the four times range combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides us significant financial flexibility, especially as beer CapEx spend normalizes. This flexibility combined with our continued focus on our significant organic growth opportunities. And strong free cash flow generation capabilities should provide us ample opportunity to increase future returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So Rob just\u2026 David Klein : Good morning Nik. Nik Modi : Good morning and congratulations David. David Klein : Thank you. Nik Modi : Real question strategically on the wine portfolio, Constellation still have a lot of exposure to the low end of the wine segment despite focusing internal and M&A resources on becoming bigger at the higher end. So I\u2019m just curious, have you guys ever thought about becoming a lot more aggressive on shedding the low end of the portfolio and then taking those proceeds to innovate more at the high end and compliment it with more bolt-ons like the one we saw today? Rob Sands : Yeah, Nik, that\u2019s something that we have done over the years. We\u2019ve really shed the bulk of the low-end portfolio. I think around, I don\u2019t know 2008 when I became CEO and we disposed off the Almaden and Inglenook brands, which were primarily by that time 5-liter bag in the box which really represents the vast majority of the sub-premium market. Now that said, we do desire to continue to offer a full portfolio of wine to both our wholesale and retail customers, because even elements of the sub-premium part of the business remain important. And for us to remain a relevant supplier, we feel that it\u2019s strategically important to remain in that business. Now that said, we really do not focus any of our advertising or marketing dollars against those brands and have really shifted almost virtually a 100% of those resources against our higher margin or I should say high margin focus brands and to drive a positive mix in the business. So that\u2019s currently where we stand. We don\u2019t have any plans to divest anymore of the tail part of the portfolio. Nik Modi : Great. And then just one real quick one on capital allocations, I know you guys referenced dividend and buybacks. And if you can just provide a little bit more context on buybacks, I mean, can we expect something once the beer CapEx is kind of passed its peak or is that something that could happen sooner? Rob Sands : Go ahead, David. David Klein : Yes. So, as you probably know we still have about $700 million remaining under previously authorize share repurchase program. I would say as Rob outlined our capital allocation priorities, we do have the brewery build out underway. We have just recently instituted the dividend. And so I think we need to work our way through those but we are open to share repurchases once again when the time is right. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey good morning Rob and welcome David. Just the question about the Beer business. You increased your outlook or ratio outlook for the year and just simplistically is that because you track better in the first quarter than what you were expecting in the balance to the year, your plans haven\u2019t really changed much or is it a function of your -- even your outlook for the balance of the year has improved? Rob Sands : I think it\u2019s both Bryan. I mean the Beer business volume and dollar growth is tracking well ahead of our expectations. We don\u2019t really see a chink in that armor in the rest of the year. So we really don\u2019t have any reason to believe at this stage that there will be a significant slowdown. So, yes, that has caused us to realistically raise our guidance on beer growth for the year to 10% net sales. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And just as a follow-up the -- in terms of the production turning on in Nava, the additional production turning on by the end of the calendar year, just in terms of milestones, have we started like test batch brewing yet? Is just -- if you just kind of update us where we stand now in terms of the milestones on hitting that target? David Klein : Yeah. Bryan, so there is a lot of activity going on in Nava as you would expect, right. And so, the first thing is that, we are going to see that really begin to come online our packaging lines. We don\u2019t expect actual brew house to be in a functioning state until closer to the end of the calendar year. But I can say that, at this point everything is going according to plan in the build-out at Nava. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Rob Sands : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : Hi. David Klein : Good morning, Judy. Judy Hong : So, first, just, Rob, regarding the CFO transition announcement and understand that Bob is obviously not on the call to answer this question? But, I guess, the timing was somewhat unexpected for many people? So anything you can share with us in terms of what led to that decision, particularly on the timing issue? Rob Sands : No. I mean, there is really nothing to share. I mean, obviously, the timing was related to when we had these discussions internally and when, therefore, it was appropriate to make the announcement relative to Bob\u2019s departure. So there is really nothing more or less to it than that. Obviously, when the decision was made that that Bob was leaving, we had to make an announcement and I don\u2019t really care when that announcement would have been made it would have seen as it did at whatever time it was, so that\u2019s pretty much it, Judy. Judy Hong : Okay. Sorry, David. David Klein : Hi. Judy Hong : Okay. So, second question, David, just in terms of the gross margin on the beer side, I mean, certainly, Q1, I think, came in a little higher than what we would have anticipated and I think, you commented on some of the fluctuations that you expect throughout the year? But can you give us a little bit more color, just in terms of the bridge for Q1 and how that sort of evolves as we get into the balance of the year? David Klein : Yeah. So what you would see year-over-year, Q1 to Q1 is, margin expansion driven by pricing, as well as COGS improvement as our procurement team has taken over the procurement activities at the brewery. For the rest of the year and by the way the brewery also was operating effectively at capacity in the first quarter which gives us the better number as well. For the rest of the year, we are going to bring on several packaging lines, we are going to bring on part of a new warehouse and we are going to bring on the first 5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. And once we put them in service, meaning, we have run beer down the line or beer through the brew house for commercial sale, we then put those assets into service, which means we begin depreciation. However, at that point, there is still a lot of work as you might imagine that goes into optimizing the lines in the brew house and the warehouse, and any of that expense that happen after we put the assets into service falls right to the bottomline as an expense, right. So we expect that that\u2019s going to create some of the choppiness for the rest of the year. And then, additionally, as I mentioned, in my initial comments, we have an inflation adjustment on the finished goods that we are buying from ABI that actually took effect the first week of June. So I think that really kind of bridges this out from the 34.8% really to the 33% range, which we called out. Judy Hong : Okay. And just on clarification, that also include some of the packaging procurement savings that you would have seen already or expected to see as you get into the balance of the year? David Klein : Yeah. We built in -- again our procurement guys have done an outstanding job of really getting us some great benefits. We\u2019ve built that into the guidance that we\u2019ve provided for the year. Judy Hong : Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial. Mark Swartzberg : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations David. Two questions, one on the beer side, we saw price mix just shy of 1%, which was a similar number to the last quarter. Could you just speak to not only your view of that number going forward for you but also to what -- which I presume is largely a mix issue but why isn\u2019t that number stronger? And then how are you -- how does that relate to what you are seeing up there in the market place from competition? So just some comments on the pricing environment, how you see it playing out for you? And then totally unrelated question is on this cost cutting you\u2019ve announced which is good to see. Could you give us a little bit of detail on where you expect those savings to come from and to what extent this is sort of a moment in time thing you\u2019re doing and to what extent you think you\u2019ll be engaging in this sort of thing going forward? Rob Sands : Yeah, Mark. First of on your question on price mix. Basically, our plan has, I should say, our plan or our view has not changed at all from the year -- for the year. We really haven\u2019t moved into the season where beer pricing is usually taken which is in the fall. We will of course be looking at the market as we normally do on a market-by-market, case-by-case basis. But we still fully expect that we\u2019ll be within our guidance range of 1% to 2% on price mix. So we don\u2019t see anything at the moment that would cause us to believe any differently than that. And then, your second question? Mark Swartzberg : Well, second question was\u2026 Rob Sands : Yeah. Cost savings from restructuring\u2026 Mark Swartzberg : The cost savings and to what extent\u2026 Rob Sands : Yeah. We don\u2019t expect\u2026 Mark Swartzberg : [Indiscernible] you need to do it? Rob Sands : Yeah. We don\u2019t expect any material cost savings from the restructuring really because that was more of a streamlining in some areas and a reallocation in other areas. So really what we\u2019ve done here is we\u2019ve taken a look at the business. We\u2019ve said okay what areas could use greater efficiencies, streamlining, areas that aren\u2019t -- I'll say commercially oriented, aren\u2019t directly related to revenue and that we thought could function better and if they were streamlined and made more efficient. At the same time, we are reallocating resources to what we think are critical revenue and growth driving areas for the future of Bill Newlands\u2019 innovation and growth organization. We\u2019re building a big organization, a reasonably large organization under Bill to continue to drive effective growth and innovation. We\u2019re also redirecting dollars to the commercial side of the business in the form of brand building activities again that we think will continue to drive organic growth. So again, we\u2019re just being prudent around making sure that we are investing in the right areas of the business for the future. Mark Swartzberg : And innovation in Chicago specifically are getting a lot of those -- redirection so to speak with dollars? Rob Sands : For innovation, yeah, and it\u2019s not Chicago per se, I mean, it\u2019s really San Francisco and Chicago where -- it's both places where beer, Wine and Spirits innovation people are located and then the commercial side of the businesses as I said we\u2019re -- we continue to increase our spends in advertising and marketing because we think that it\u2019s critical to continue to drive the kind of success that we\u2019ve had. So in particular, the commercial side of beer is a very important part of the business for us to continue to invest in because we can\u2019t just take our current growth and be penny wise and dollar foolish for the future. We have to make sure that we are taking all of the right steps to ensure that we are able to maintain this kind of hit it out of the ballpark growth that we\u2019ve been enjoying. Mark Swartzberg : Great. Great. Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Rob. Rob Sands : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Rob Sands : Hi, Tim. Tim Ramey : Hey. Good morning. Thanks. It looked to me and you sort of alluded to this that the Meiomi acquisition is a lot like the Mark West deal asset like no assets book one sourced. Am I correct in that, or is that a fair characterization of the business? Rob Sands : Totally fair characterization of the business. Tim Ramey : Okay. Rob Sands : It also enables us to reallocate internally some of our resources against higher end Pinot Noir. Tim Ramey : Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, this means higher capacity utilization for Pinot Noir. Rob Sands : Yeah. A lot of synergies is at the bottomline because as you said, there are no assets other than some existing inventory in the intellectual property. So we are fully capable of continuing to produce the wine in the style that -- and this is important. The style -- have you had the wine? Tim Ramey : I have not. I\u2019m yet to try. Rob Sands : It\u2019s an interesting Pinot Noir. I mean it did become successful as it is, because it\u2019s sort of a run of the mill product. It\u2019s a somewhat unique product for a Pinot Noir and that it\u2019s a little heavier and fuller body than I would say your typical California Pinot Noir in that price point. Tim Ramey : Got it. Rob Sands : And you tell something about that, Tim? Tim Ramey : Okay. I will do more research. And I\u2019m guessing the relevant EBITDA for the $65 million in sales, may not be that big. Do you feel like you can disclose that? Are you basically valuing this off the performing EBITDA? Rob Sands : Yeah. No, we really haven\u2019t disclosed it. But the purchase price pre-synergies was about 10 times the transferred margins. So post-synergies, it\u2019s going to be significantly better than that. So it\u2019s real good deal especially given the growth rate, which was I think 50% in IRI on over a half a million cases in the last 12 months. So, I mean tremendous deal. Tim Ramey : If it\u2019s anything like Mark West, you will have a great success. Thanks a lot. Rob Sands : Better than Mark West, Tim. Tim Ramey : Okay. Rob Sands : Not that that wasn\u2019t a great one too. Tim Ramey : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Rob Sands : Hey Vivien. Vivien Azer : Hi, guys. Good morning. How are you? David Klein : Good morning. Vivien Azer : Congratulations, David. My first question has to do with your outlook, clearly quite good. I was hoping you could offer a little bit of incremental color in terms of the positive guidance revision, Corona relative to Modelo please? David Klein : Yeah. I would say in the, kind of breakout between Corona and Model is 50. I think the interesting thing that we\u2019ve seen in our portfolio over the recent history has been the growth and acceleration of growth for Corona Extra. About 40% of that growth has been driven by the can introduction, which we are very pleased. But again, it\u2019s such a large brand that the Corona brand growing is very good for Constellation. And I would say that we still -- we expect to continue to see the growth rates that we\u2019ve been experiencing recently for Modelo Especial and others. There is no indication that that brand is slowing down at this time. Vivien Azer : Terrific. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My second question switching to the wine side of the business. Rob, you outlined a number of commercial initiatives and marketing that\u2019s launching around the number of wine brands. So as we think about total company [A&P] [ph] as a percentage of sales, certainly that\u2019s stepped up in '15. How should we think about that for fiscal '16 please? Rob Sands : For this year? Vivien Azer : Yes please. Rob Sands : Yes. I think that we will continue to see two things, okay, increased marketing and the concentration of that marketing against the smaller subset of brands. As I mentioned, we have initiated TV marketing at fairly significant rates against Black Box, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, for example. And with the way that we can measure very directly now through household type surveys and pantry studies the impact of our advertising, we believe quite strongly that some of these campaigns, in particular the Black Box and the Mondavi Woodbridge that we have previously tested is actually not only good for longer-term brand building, but we think that it pays back in the short run with the incremental increase in purchases and consumption that we\u2019ve seen in the test markets where we run these ads. So we are expanding that. And I think that what you\u2019re seeing basically is our depletion growth, which was in the 3.5% range, which is an acceleration, is indicative that what we\u2019re doing is working. And then also from a depletion point of view, which is a little hard to see through our financial results, which are shipment based, we are seeing a pretty significant increase in mix as well against the business. So pretty much I would say that what we are doing here is working pretty well, in fact I think very well. So we are pretty optimistic about the Wine and Spirits business for the remainder of the year. Vivien Azer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. Rob Sands : Thank you. Caroline Levy : Hi. And congratulations, David. We look to forward to spending more time with you. My question is about the regional performance of the Beer business, because it seems like Sydney Big Bear had a very difficult May from what I understand. And there was quite a bit of out-of-date inventory on the shelves towards the end of May, early June. And maybe that is simply in certain regions. But any detail you could give us on what you saw in your brands and whether you think big brands will hold pricing as you move through the summer? Rob Sands : Yes. So May was tough for some of our competitors. It was not particularly tough for ourselves. We saw a slight deceleration, but it was probably a result of their being one less selling day in the month, which has about a 1/20th or a 5% anticipated impact, June, very strong. IRI dollars for our Beer business in the four week period ending 06/21, up 14% for Constellation\u2019s Beer business in dollars, so we see no negative impact or unusual occurrence relative to May on our business. But as I said, yeah, some of our competitors have found that period to be difficult. And regionally the answer continues to be no as well. There is nothing going on regionally for us in terms of a shift of geographic mix, or we\u2019re not seeing an acceleration in some parts of the country and a slowdown and other. Everything is pretty much steady as it goes, so nothing for us. Hence, we increased our guidance now for the year to the 10% sales growth range on the Beer business because as I said in my -- in the answer to some of the earlier questions, it\u2019s just evident to us that our previous guidance was understated relative to current and expected trends for the remainder of the year. Caroline Levy : That\u2019s excellent. Just a quick follow-on on the cans, there are markets where you\u2019ve tasted them where cans are 6% of mix. Overall, can you give us an idea of where they are now and where you think they could go? Rob Sands : Yes. So just kind of to look at quarter-over-quarter and I will focus on Corona because remember, Modelo Especial is a big can brand, right. But the new launch is really focused on Corona Extra. And for Corona Extra, say first quarter last year, about 3% of our depletions were in cans and this year was about 5%. We clearly believe that we\u2019ll continue to see the can momentum build. And we also know, however, that we won\u2019t end up with a can mix like the domestic players. But we think we can someday line up maybe more in line with some of the other import players in terms of their can mix. Caroline Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Good. Terrific quarter, guys. Just back on the cans where we\u2019re on that, can you give us any sort of sense of -- and I know it\u2019s a guess, what sort of cannibalization rate you\u2019re getting with can? David Klein : We think the cannibalization rate is fairly low, actually probably below everybody\u2019s expectation. So, I don\u2019t think we can really know what the cannibalization rate is by the way, right, because you\u2019d have to say well, okay, glass would have grown at X percent but for the cans, we can\u2019t answer that question necessarily. And so we think the cans are representing -- let's put it this way, primarily incremental business. So probably at this like 3% to 5% that we\u2019re talking about right now, cans are being used on occasions where glass could not here 2%, 4%, have been used. And therefore, we think pretty low cannibalization and pretty much incremental growth. Rob Ottenstein : Okay. Thank you. And as my follow-up, it\u2019s my understanding that at California and particularly, Southern California represents something like 25% of the business and Texas 10%. And I was just very surprised that you didn\u2019t apparently see any impact from kind of historically bad weather and rainfalls in those areas and it\u2019s obviously a tribute to the strength and momentum of the business. But I\u2019m just wondering would results have been even better with kind of normal weather in Southern California and Texas? Rob Sands : Yes. Maybe. I would say, yes. I\u2019d say, we did see a little bit of impact of weather towards the end of May but everything just kind of bounced right back in June. So it\u2019s kind of hard to say whether there was really any impact from that. Probably as I said, the sell day was the greatest impact that we had in May, even though the weather had do have had some kind of effect on a temporary basis on the sales. But we don\u2019t think that it was anything material and it certainly hasn\u2019t driven any trend change into the extent that I don\u2019t know, in Texas people couldn\u2019t get out and buy beer, they restocked. Rob Ottenstein : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Good morning. Thanks for the question. And welcome, David. Two quick ones. One, just on back on Meiomi, should we still kind of expect the kind of one deal a year tuck-in whereas the market changed where you\u2019re seeing more opportunities out there in the wine space? Rob Sands : I think that the one deal a year is an overstatement. Let\u2019s see, since I have been CEO for the last eight years, I think we\u2019ve done three deals of that nature, Mark West, Casa Noble, and now Meiomi. Our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. No, we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that there is any more significant deal flow. I wouldn\u2019t suggest anything different will occur from a number or timing perspective. We keep our eye open for these kinds of things that come around every once in a while. They are very advantageous if it\u2019s the right thing at the right time. We tried to stay away from some of the -- I\u2019m going to say trendier stuff that has the tendency to kind of go up and down. You take Meiomi, you take Mark West. These were classic brands in a category. In this case, pinot noir, which is not trendy, but fast growing and will continue we believe to be a fast growing varietal as people continue to discover pinot noir. And we think taste preferences are on a long-term basis changing towards pinot noir. So Mark West covers sort of the $10 to $12 pinot noir range and Meiomi covers sort of the $20-plus pinot noir range. So that puts us in a really strong position in one of the fastest growing and most stable segments of wine, which is the pinot noir varietal in particular. So now no change in sort of the frequency or of those kind of deals. Bill Chappell : Okay. Thanks. And that helps. And then David just actually housekeeping on tax rate, tax rate is higher this quarter. Should it just be close to the 30.3 for the rest of the year or is there any given quarter where there is kind of catch-up to get you that 30.5? David Klein : Yes. I think as you know our tax rate, our ATR in a given quarter is really driven by the geography of the earnings and our resolution of our various tax issues. So I would say that for us we are confident in the 30.5 rate and we don\u2019t really have a view on the quarters where the delta will land. Bill Chappell : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thank you everyone for joining our call today. We covered a lot of ground. But before we go, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the excellent performance of our business this quarter. Our team plans to continue to capitalize on the tremendous momentum we have underway in the Beer business to drive growth and enhance financial performance. From a Wine and Spirits perspective, we are gaining traction and we are on track to achieve our goals for the year. I\u2019m also excited about the acquisition of Meiomi wine business, which is an excellent addition to our portfolio. Our fiscal '16 is off to a great start and we are eager to continue this momentum into our summer selling season. As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, I hope you remember to bring some of our fine wine products to your celebration and to please enjoy them responsibly. We will be on the road next week as we begin to introduce David Klein to those of you he has not already met. So I look forward to seeing you. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s second quarter 2016 sales and earnings results. I am very pleased with our excellent quarterly results. Our Beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results. Our Wine and Spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year and we continue to progress as planned with our Nava brewery and glass plant expansions. Let\u2019s drive right into the commercial and operational results we saw this quarter for our Beer business. During the second quarter, the Beer business generated double-digit depletion growth driven by exceptional consumer demand for our products across the Beer portfolio. In fact, the second quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of volume market share growth for our Beer portfolio. Constellation beers represented 45% of total U.S. beer industry volume growth during the quarter, as all of our Beer brands grew across most channels and package sizes. Excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season with the 120 days of summer marketing campaign drove market share gains during the 4th of July, which continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the summer months, driven by continuing velocity, growth and distribution gains, including the can launch and ongoing investments in media and merchandising with the new Always Summer marketing campaign. The new Corona cans continue to expand consumption occasions for the brand and are a hit with consumers. Cans represented more than 40% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. Throughout the summer we dedicated significant media support behind the can launch with English and Spanish language TV and digital advertising, especially during the July 4th and Labor Day holidays. We see great opportunity with this format, as it currently represents only about 5% of total Corona Extra volume. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the second quarter driven by continuing velocity and distribution gains. The brands increased media investments, including the continuation of Modelo Especial national English language TV and Video campaign continued throughout the summer months reaching the general market and bicultural Hispanic beer drinkers through targeted entertainment and sports programming. National Hispanic media included the Gold Cup Broadcast Sponsorship on Univision throughout the month of July, including in-game advertising and sponsorships. Corona Light continued to gain share with all core Corona Light packages posting growth during the quarter. Three new brand TV spots were showcased on national TV throughout the summer and the brands sponsored Kenny Chesney Tour continued with 29-tour dates from June through August. For the remainder of the year, we have solid marketing programs in place in order to maintain the excellent brand momentum we are experiencing across the portfolio. For Corona Extra, the football season continues to grow in importance through our returning partnership with Coach Jon Gruden and maintenance of key investments with the NFL, the number one program on TV. Boxing also remains a priority with Corona Extra through an integrated marketing plan to support highly anticipated fights. The momentum of the Corona can format will be supported through general market and Hispanic TV support into the fall football tailgating season. And you should expect to see our iconic Corona Feliz TV spot leading into Thanksgiving Holiday, which will be accompanied by robust on-and-off premise promotional programs designed to drive brand affinity for Corona during the holiday season. For Modelo Especial, we have added six weeks of live TV sports program on national English language TV during the start of the NFL season across CBS, FOX, ESPN and ESPN2. National Hispanic media will also continue for Modelo Especial with the weekly TV exposure to Spanish language consumers. Before moving now to a discussion of our Beer operations, I am pleased to announce today that we are launching our new Tocayo Hominy White Ale, a craft Belgian style wheat beer inspired by the culture and flavors of Mexico. The idea for this new beer brand was develop our beer team working in conjunction with Chef Rick Bayless. It will be available beginning next week at several of the Rick Bayless\u2019 Chicago, Frontera restaurants and other key Chicago area on-premise accounts. Our Beer operations continued to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics related to cost, quality, capacity utilization and service are better than target this quarter. New bottling lines are currently being commissioned and will become fully operational by year end. Support for the expansion such as co-generation, waste water, engine room and fire protection are all on schedule. Work continues on the next expansion phase as we increase production capability from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capabilities around the site. Overall, the strong results that the Beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s EPS guidance for 2016. We are now targeting EBIT growth for the Beer business in the 15% to 18%, which is expected to drive an enhanced operating margin of approximately 34% for this segment in fiscal 2016 versus our previous margin estimate of 33%. While we are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits, which combined are the most significant drivers of the revised Beer margin for fiscal 2016, we have also experienced better than planned operational results driven by our glass plant performance. We are on track to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of capacity online at Nava by calendar year end. Once this capacity is operational we will be positioned to bring the next 5 million hectoliters into service by next summer. Upon completion of this 10 million hectoliters expansion, the interim supply agreement with ABI for finished goods will no longer be required as we will be fully sub-sufficient from a supply perspective to fulfill our needs for the U.S. market. We expect to receive the full benefits of our targeted mid 30% operating margin goal on a more sustainable basis once we are fully operational at 20 million hectoliters at Nava. And although we are already approaching this longer term margin target, we will still have much to accomplish. I would like to remind everybody that the 5 million hectoliters of capacity that will increase Nava capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters is expected to be completed by calendar 2017. Finally, given the continued strength of our Beer business, we continue to make progress in evaluating plans for our future capacity needs beyond 25 million hectoliters and we will have more to say as we finalize our plans in coming months. And now I would like to discuss the business results for our Wine and Spirits business. In the Wine and Spirits business during the second quarter we achieved earnings growth and solid margin expansion, while delivering strong spirit performance and excellent overall results for our Canadian business. In the U.S. our net sales are benefiting from positive mix trends and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We have successfully integrated our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and are working to expand distribution to drive incremental growth for this brand. The most recent four week IRI trends show that Meiomi is growing more than 80% in multi-outlet and convenience channels, which is contributing to the fact that are premium plus dollar growth improved in recent periods. Throughout the quarter our focused investments within Wine and Spirits could be seen the marketplace. As a remainder, we are concentrating our investments and our resources on a key subset of our focus brands, because we believe they have the right combination of scale, high margins and growth potential to drive our overall business results. Let\u2019s talk about the few examples of these programs, our TV advertising for Woodbridge aired over the summer and helped drive strong IRI growth for this brand during this timeframe. This program will rev up again in advance of our winter holiday selling season. Our Kim Crawford brand is the unrivaled leader of the New Zealand category with its distinct flavor profile and undue ordinary marketing platform. This summer it kicked off as exclusive national campaign with Cirque du Soleil and executed promotional programs with co-branded advertising, offers, sweepstakes, and sampling event. Kim Crawford posted dollar growth of more than 30%in the recent IRI period. Mark West, America\u2019s number one Pinot Noir, five times consecutive winner of Impact's Hot Brand award is harnessing the power of its unique majority male shopper base with targeted digital Facebook ads and expanded print media in conjunction with its healthy growing campaign. And this month, we are launching Mark West\u2019s Black to take further advantage of the Pinot Noir craze. Overall, we experienced the completion trends of more than 6% for our focus brands during the second quarter, which demonstrates that this strategy is paying off. We\u2019ve also taken some exciting steps towards our goal of developing new brands and have potential for win big with consumers. The newest wine brand in the portfolio, Tom Gore, is named for Tom, a second generation grape farmer, who has a passion for cultivating fruit with exceptional flavor and quality from his wines. This brand resonates with consumer\u2019s search for authenticity of the origin, ingredients and people involved and what they eat and drink. And we are very pleased with its preliminary results. During the quarter, our spirits portfolio experienced excellent net sales growth of 19% and solid depletion growth across the portfolio, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the success of its peach flavor offering as well as SVEDKA Vodka led by its hit flavors, mango, pineapple, strawberry, lemonade and grapefruit jalapeno. Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectation so far this year with continuing share gains after particularly strong depletion growth barring Cinco de Mayo. And we continue to make focus Casa Noble marketing investments in four key local markets, L.A., New York, Chicago and Texas where activation programs include tasting, cocktail features in collaboration with our beer portfolio for local events. Print ads targeting millennial consumers are also running in regional publications. This quarter we launched the national rollout of SERPENT'S BITE, a bold whisky enthused with apple cider flavors. This product targets the intersection of three of the hardest trends in alcoholic beverages, flavored whisky, hard cider and the shot occasion. Though it is too early to comment on long-term expectations for this brand, our retailer and consumer feedback has been very positive. And we are pleased with what has been a fantastic start to the development of this brand. As we head into the key holiday seasons for our Wine and Spirits business, we will be executing programming design to ensure that we continue to drive growth especially for our focus brands. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest which is currently more than 80% complete and is expected to be completely finished by mid-October. The current California industry estimate is for total harvest yield of 3.6 million to 3.8 million ton versus approximately 4 million tons last year. While the crop is down this year versus last, quality looks to be very good with excellent color and flavors and our winemakers are smiling. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grape pricing to be flat-to-down slightly versus last year depending on the variety, locations and demand with the exception of Cabernet, which continues to be in high demand. In closing, we are at the halfway point in the year and I\u2019m very gratified with our impressive results so far this year. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery and glass point expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. And within our Wine and Spirits business, we are making good progress overall and I believe we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brand during the upcoming holiday selling season. This December marks the 70th anniversary of our company\u2019s founding. We are proud of our heritage and look forward to positioning our company to the next 70 years of living our vision to elevate life with every glass raise. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for financial discussion of our second quarter results. David Klein : Thank you, Rob, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results during the key summer selling season. The strong beer performance along with some favorability in our interest expense are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.20 to a range of $5 to $5.20 per share for fiscal \u201816. The beer performance along with lower than previously expected payments for taxes and interest are also helping to push our fiscal \u201816 free cash flow projection, up $100 million to a range of $200 million to $300 million. And our glass plant and brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned as we are positioned to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of additional capacity on line during the second half of fiscal \u201816. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q2 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 9% through the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 13%. As a reminder, during Q2 fiscal \u201815, we estimated that beer recall activities resulted in the reversal of approximately 2 million case shipments to wholesalers and the $37 million reduction in net sales. If you adjust last year second quarter for the impact of this activity, volume growth in this year second quarter would have been closer to 9% and net sales growth closer to 10%. We replenished the Q2 fiscal \u201815 recall volume with shipments to wholesalers during the third quarter of fiscal \u201815. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of last year to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. As a result of these activities, we will be facing a difficult beer sales and EBIT growth comparison for Q3 fiscal \u201816. Beer sales growth for the first half of fiscal 2016 totaled 13%. However, the difficult third quarter comparison is a primary driver of why we continue to expect full year fiscal \u201816 beer net sales growth to approximate 10%. We continue to expect solid third quarter depletion growth. Wine and Spirit net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects higher spirit shipment volume. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $93 million, up 13% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $89 million, primarily due to volume growth, lower COGS and favorable pricing and our beer gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 48.4%. Wine and Spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and COGS benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 41.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $5 million. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $88 million and consolidated operating margin improved 320 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 450 basis points. This improvement reflects the gross profit benefits that I just highlighted, plus favorability and marketing spend on a per case basis for the quarter. The marketing spend benefit is timing related as we expect to see higher marketing spend during Q3 and for the full year. Wine and Spirits operating margin improved 90 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit benefits discussed earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was $77 million, down 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of August, our total debt was $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.1 billion, a decrease of $144 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This activity primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. We now expect interest expense for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. The improvement in this target reflects favorability in short-term interest rates and timing of our CapEx spend versus our original plan. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.6% and compares to a 32.3% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We still expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. As a result, we expect our tax rate for the second half of the year to run above our projected full year rate. Now, let\u2019s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first half of fiscal \u201916, we generated $508 million of free cash flow compared to just $360 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $803 million versus $668 million for the prior year periods. This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings generated by the Beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the Beer business and lower projected tax and interest payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal \u201916. CapEx for the first half of fiscal \u201916 totaled $295 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending during the same timeframe last year. Our Brewery expansion activities continued to progress as planned, but we have seen some shifting in the timing of our CapEx, with the higher level of spending expected to come in the second half of the year. Overall, we are still targeting CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal \u201916, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal \u201916 free cash flow to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. Now let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal \u201916 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, due to continued strong results for our Beer business and lower than expected interest expense, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5 to $5.20 per share versus our previous $4.80 to $5 range. The Beer business continues to target mid to high single-digit volume growth and net sales growth of approximately 10%. As a reminder, fiscal \u201915 beer shipments went ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal \u201916 depletion growth rate to be in the high single-digit range and above the shipment growth rate of mid to high single-digits. We are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits along with better than expected glass plant performance that are helping to drive improved operational results. Therefore, we now expect the Beer business to generate 15% to 18% operating income growth. This guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% for fiscal \u201916. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range before any benefits from the Meiomi acquisition. While we anticipate improving depletion trends in the second half of fiscal \u201916, we expect to see most of the Wine and Spirits sales growth to be driven in Q4 versus Q3 due to shipment timing and comparisons versus the second half of fiscal \u201915. Our fiscal \u201916 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the first half of the year and our projected sales earnings and operating cash flow growth for the full year of fiscal \u201916. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohseniun with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohseniun : Hey. Good morning. David Klein : Good morning. Dara Mohseniun : The fiscal 2016 beer guidance implies near 34% margins already with the FX and cost favorability. So you are really at the mid-30s long-term target rate. So, I guess why haven\u2019t you raised the long-term guidance and when can we expect more clarity on that guidance? David Klein : So, we don\u2019t typically provide the long-term guidance. We provided the medium-term guidance if you will, so we can give people a sense of our Beer business. I would say that we still intend to have beer margins that are in line with the industry leaders in North America. In fact, we would likely be the benchmark if we achieve our mid-30s guidance in the mid-term. I would also say that it\u2019s -- we are early on in the process of bringing our capacity online with Nava and so Dara to really answer your question, specifically once we get that production capacity in place, we will be in a better position to make an adjustment if any to our medium-term guidance. Dara Mohseniun : Okay. That makes sense. And then I was hoping you could discuss the level of cannibalization you are seeing on Corona, with the can business doing so well, doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s had much impact and also maybe conceptually, can you discuss where you think can mix for Corona can move over time versus the 5% level you had highlighted earlier? David Klein : Yeah. So, we do know there is cannibalization between the can and the bottle. When we pick a part of our business and we look at the drivers and drags of our business, we see a little cannibalization. But you have to look at our numbers year-to-date and you see that our bottle depletions are up mid single-digits while our cans have expanded from 3% of our mix last year to 6% of our mix this year. So, we are seeing some cannibalizations but we are not seeing it effect the overall brand of Corona. In terms of where we think the mix can get to, our Modelo brand is more of a can centric brand. We don\u2019t really see Corona becoming a can centric brand. The purpose of the can is to just provide incremental consumption occasions for our consumers. Dara Mohseniun : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Rob Sands : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from my side. Just a quick update on the Corona Draft tests that you have been running, just any early thoughts on that. And then, I guess, the bigger picture question is on wine. Just tell me if I have this right in terms of thinking about the long-term strategy, effectively given you still have a big chunk of your portfolio in the low end of the wine category, more about harvesting those brands for profit and reinvesting in the premium end of the portfolio so you can rebalance the portfolio over time. Am I thinking about that in the right way? Rob Sands : Yes, Nik. So I guess I will start with the wine question first. You know in volumetric terms, it\u2019s a large chunk of our portfolio that sort of subpremium, but in actuality, in terms of what\u2019s really generating our profits and the bulk of our sales, it\u2019s our focused brands, and that\u2019s all largely premium. And then to your question, the answer is, is basically yes as to what you have described. The strategy is definitely about not worrying too much about the non-strategic part of the portfolio, which is the subpremium. And we did take some pricing very successfully this year in that part of the portfolio. And we are reinvesting against, as I mentioned in my script, a smaller subset of our focused brands. And we think that sort of that mix of activity will drive stronger overall results which I believe that it is and I believe that it will. So we are pretty optimistic about the Wine and Spirits business in general. This year, it\u2019s going to be a good year. And then what\u2019s your question on beer? Nik Modi : Yes. On the Corona Draft test? Rob Sands : Yes. I think that we continue to test Corona Draft in a number of places. And I would say that the Corona Draft test is proving to be very successful. And I guess you could ask what do we mean by that, okay? And what we do mean by that is, we see it thus far as being additive as opposed to just sort of a peer swap out on-premise. And then where we do have it, we see some positive effects in the marketplace around it, meaning in the off-premise. There seems to be a positive effect when we have Corona on Draft on the on-premise on than our off-premise sales in the area. So the test is positive, but at the same time Corona is our by far most important brand. And we are going to be very thoughtful about how we proceed basically with anything new with that brand. So good news is the brand is performing better than ever right now or at least as it relates to shorter-term history. So again, Beer business is extremely strong. Nik Modi : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : So first on the beer depletion, the second quarter performance, 10%, pretty healthy number, but I guess that\u2019s a little bit softer than what the Nielsen or some of the measured channel data has shown. So first, can you talk about maybe what the disconnect is there? And then your full year guidance also implies some slowdown in the back half, which also seems to be at odds with very strong acceleration that we are seeing in the measured channel data. So just wanted to get a little bit more color just in terms of the depletion trend in the second quarter and then the growth in the back half? Rob Sands : Yes. Well, Judy, you know, we basically -- our guidance has called out high single digit for beer depletion performance. And obviously, we are outperforming that at 10%. So I would say that our beer depletion performance exceeds our expectations. But realizing that we have some -- continued to have tough overlaps in terms of strong growth last year too, I mean we can only be relatively cautious as to the kind of growth that we are willing to predict. So I hope we far exceed those numbers, but I think that high single digit remains, depletion growth remains a good estimate. We do have some pricing that we are taking right now in the marketplace in the 1% to 2% range like we talked about historically. And while we feel that the brand is in an extremely strong position to take that pricing, it\u2019s not as if it will have zero impact on depletion growth. And then in terms of IRI and the disconnect, I think that IRI only measures about half of the business, the half that it doesn\u2019t measure is the half that\u2019s not necessarily industry-wide performing very well, like the on-premise for instance, and liquor stores as an example that are the more sluggish part of the industry. That said, we are performing of course better than anybody else in those channels, but those channels are not the highest performing channels, whereas the IRI channels being grocery and convenience are some of the strongest channels at the current time. So I would say that\u2019s where the disconnect is. Judy Hong : Okay. And David, just in terms of the glass cost, I think in your prepared comment you had called out gross margins on beer benefiting some better glass plant performance. So number one, I just wanted to get clarifications on what that means? Secondly, just in terms of your mix of what you\u2019re now sourcing from the OI JV as well as the Vitro, if you can just get a mix of where the sourcing of glass comes from as of the second quarter? And then the O-I\u2019s proposed acquisition of Vitro, does that have any impacts on your glass sourcing arrangement going forward? David Klein : Okay, Judy. Yes, so when I referenced the glass joint venture performance, I am really talking about and you will see this in our Q, which we intend to file today, which is a first for us to file our Q on the same day as earnings calls. You will see that we have a profit at the glass joint venture level, which was not in our expectations for the year, because there were a fair number of startup costs. So we\u2019ve -- we -- the joint venture team on the ground in Nava, as well as our partners at Owens-Illinois have done an outstanding job of smoothly getting our furnished at Nava functioning well. So as a result of that we\u2019re seeing better profit performance from the joint venture and that allows us to shift our mix just a little bit and I don\u2019t have the exact numbers Judy, but to shift our mix a little bit toward our own glass plant as opposed to third-party providers, which gives us near-term in particular freight benefits as it relates to the glass plant. And we have a -- to get on the Vitro acquisition question, we have a very strong relationship with Owens-Illinois. We have the separation if you will that comes from owning the joint venture with O-I and so we\u2019re not concerned at all about O-I taking or acquiring Vitro, because again, we control our own destiny along with O-I at our own joint venture. Judy Hong : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hi, Bryan. Morning. Bryan Spillane : Just wanted to ask one question or one topic just capital allocation. And maybe, David, if you could sort of remind us or update us on your current thinking in terms of share repurchases, kind of where you\u2019re comfortable in terms of leverage on the balance sheet? And I guess, as you\u2019re contemplating additional brewing capacity, just how we should think about kind of where cash is going to go, whether its dividends, repurchases or CapEx over the next couple years? David Klein : Yeah. So as we position this business for total shareholder return for the medium-term, the most important thing that we can do is ensure that we have enough capacity to service our high margin Beer business. And so when we think about capital allocation, number one inline is that capital expenditure required to build out Nava and to build out a second site at some point in the future. So that\u2019s really number one. I would say then beyond that we -- our capital allocation strategy hasn\u2019t change. We remained committed to our dividend, as well as share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions. I\u2019d also say, we\u2019re pretty happy coming out of the quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of about 3.7 times, which is in our range at 3 to 4 times. And I guess, where I would just caution on that leverage ratio range provide a little bit of caution in that. We have a lot of spend to complete the Nava build-out in the second half of the year and so, we\u2019re just going to be very careful with our capital decisions as we go through the build-out. Bryan Spillane : Just would that imply -- just two follow-ups to that, one is, in terms of potential build-out? Could you remind us just rough idea how much the cost per hectoliter is to build-out brewery expansion? And than, I guess based on that scenario or the potential to have to allocate more to CapEx, should we be thinking about share repurchases is more just covering stock options at this point and as opposed to real sort of share count reduction as a P&L lever? David Klein : Yeah. So as it relates to a new green field facility, what we\u2019ve stated in the past is that, we haven\u2019t made a decision on specific location, although we are planning for Western Mexico. We haven\u2019t made a decision on size of the build-out and then we have provided a really large range of $100 to $150 a hectoliter, recognizing that a green field will be completely starting from scratch with no basic infrastructure, which we benefited from at the Nava facility. So, we will come back to you within the next several months with definitive plans around our build-out. And I would say, based upon our volume growth numbers that that we demonstrated this quarter and for the last while, we will be spending the capital on a green field sooner than later, because its going to take four years to build out another brewery and with these kind of growth rates we will needed to keep up with capacity. I think to then answer your question on share repurchases, again, we\u2019re going to evaluate our circumstances as we go forward and depending upon the capital requirements and our leverage ratio and understanding the requirements from our dividends, we\u2019ll then consider share repurchases. I don\u2019t see anything in the very near-term though, we said this publicly as well around a large accelerated kind of program. It\u2019s likely to be methodical and it\u2019s likely to start out with absorbing dilution. Bryan Spillane : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just want to check that the delay in the capital spending that you talked about is not in anywhere reflection that there is a delay in when the plant might open? David Klein : None whatsoever. We\u2019re actually pretty happy with the progress we made in the build out at Nava. In fact, we\u2019ve now run beer down our premium glass line. So for the first time, we put labels and foil on bottles because our previous production have been Corona, primarily Corona Extra and Corona Light using the applied ceramic label bottles. And so now our premium glass line, which is Modelo Especial has run beer down the line, which is a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this moment. So we\u2019re very pleased with our progress on the brewery build out. Caroline Levy : That\u2019s great. And on the wine side we never really discussed CapEx there, but do you see any significant needs in the next couple years? David Klein : I think you\u2019ll continue to see our wine CapEx in the range it has been for the past several years. We don\u2019t expect the big change in that regard. Caroline Levy : Okay. Thank you. Then the peso benefit, any way you could call that out and tell us what do you think it will do in the back half of the year? David Klein : Yes. See that\u2019s the problem with the FX and commodity related items. There is a fair amount of variability when you\u2019re trying to predict it. But you know that we\u2019ll say about our peso exposure, it\u2019s about 15% or so of our COGS and from that you have to exclude the COGS that are attributable to ABI. And generally, we run a three year layer hedging program across our currency and commodities. And so for the remainder of this year, we are roughly 80% hedged on FX. Caroline Levy : Okay. Thank you. One of the big drivers of your business is clearly being the big incremental advertising spend behind you brands. And I mean, you mentioned in the second quarter that as a percentage of sales, it wasn\u2019t up a lot, but I think it was down a bit. But basically, do you see keeping that pressure on the brands, because I think that\u2019s going to be critical to the ongoing momentum? Do you have budgets to go up significantly on ad spend going forward? David Klein : Yes. So we expect in our Beer business for our marketing expense to be somewhere between 8.5% to 9% of net sales which implies we will continue spending at kind of the second quarter rate. As a percent of net sales, our case rate I think goes up a little bit in Q3. I will also say that that\u2019s going to be Q3 weighted as we take advantage of the fall sports season, which we found to be a successful platform for driving our brands. But we measure and are very pleased with the returns we get from our marketing investment in our beer brands and we will continue to keep that pressure on. Caroline Levy : Right. Yes, I mean, I think that\u2019s going to be critical. So your returns have obviously been incredible. Would you see going to the higher end than the 9%? Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Caroline, I think it would be -- that's the longest two questions I think we\u2019ve ever had. Caroline Levy : Sorry. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: That\u2019s okay. No worry. I guess we\u2019ll take the next question Operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Good morning, everyone. A couple here mostly related. One is, this year is being called the year of the can. And I\u2019m trying to understand, it\u2019s clear you have a lot of opportunities for share within your portfolio. But what might be the priority from here? I heard you, David just mentioned premium glass for Modelo Especial and putting an SKU into an existing account is easier than trying to add account, which is part of the job with the Especial. But what might be your next priority if you will after the year of the cans for Corona? Rob Sands : I would say that you\u2019re right on in calling out distribution. So we know, for example, that Modelo Especial roughly has 65 ACV across the market, but we also know that we have packs Light, our 12 packs bottle, which is more like 45, right. So we have a lot of ground that we can cover from a distribution standpoint. I do want to come back on the year of the can, however. We\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in Corona Extra from our year of the can program. We\u2019ve also seen a lot of growth on the Corona Light, which was a bit of ancillary benefit that came from our focus on cans and Corona. So yes, I think there are a lot of opportunities for a future growth in our brands. Mark Swartzberg : And I\u2019m trying to -- we\u2019re all looking at these 10 numbers and wondering is next year going to be an 8 or is it going to be at 12? I\u2019m just trying to not asking for a crystal ball and I know we all are. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of like, where is the real shoulder going to be from here, is it going to remain against the can, is it going to be? I think Especial has actually slowed this year in terms in rate of growth, which, of course, large numbers. But again, I\u2019m just trying to understand where you guys are deciding to make that next priority if you\u2019ll after the can for Corona? Rob Sands : Yes. I think around Modelo Especial on your particular point, we have a year-to-date depletions that are in the high 20% on the bottle itself. So that\u2019s a package that\u2019s growing really well for us. And so the momentum behind the brand continues. I see us continuing our strategy of focusing on our -- building out our strong distribution network, gaining more distribution at retail, getting our brewery completed and continuing to execute across the entire portfolio of beers that we have. Mark Swartzberg : Okay. And I know I\u2019m pressing here, but I do want to understand the brand Modelo overall, the Especial that is has rate of growth has slowed overall of all packages. Is that right and you are saying the glass is a priority there? Rob Sands : No. In the recent 12-week IRI, Modelo Especial was up 30%. David Klein : It has not slowed. Where are you getting that idea? Mark Swartzberg : Okay. Great. I\u2019m just referring to some of the materials you put out back in early September, 16% at fiscal \u201815 and accelerating this year. Got it. Okay. And then the brewery expansion or the added brewery, you are saying the next several months, can you be more specific, should we think about that as third quarter? Rob Sands : In terms of spend? Mark Swartzberg : When you would give us detail on that plan? Rob Sands : I would say roughly by end of the calendar year. Likely on our third quarter earnings call. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Rob Sands : Hi, Vivien. Vivien Azer : Hi. So, I have one question on Wine and Spirits please. Given the diverging trends that we continue to see between those two sub-segments, can you offer a little color around the margin profile of those two independent businesses? Rob Sands : Yeah. I think when we look at our Wine and Spirits business, I think it\u2019s important to -- that we are focused on the U.S. business but then when you breakdown, which amounts to 80% of our net sales by the way overall. But then when you breakdown our wine versus spirits margins, they are roughly in line across the portfolio. Vivien Azer : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. David\u2026 David Klein : That\u2019s largely because our spirits business is really sort of a mid premium as opposed to higher premium. So the margins are roughly the same as the wine business. Vivien Azer : Terrific. Thank you. And my second question has to do with the outlook for the tax rate. David, if I think back a couple of years ago, we\u2019ve seen these tax benefits before and then over time the step-up in the tax rate doesn\u2019t actually happen and so your overall tax rate ends up coming in lower than previously expected. So, I\u2019m just curious, kind of what gives you kind of confidence, the step-up in the back half? David Klein : Yeah. In the back half -- the further you get in the year, obviously you know what sorts of settlement opportunities you might be working on and I would say that we are pretty confident in our outlook for that full year rate. And I also say that our initial 30.5% guidance for the year actually included the benefits that we realized in the second quarter. What we didn\u2019t provide and we didn\u2019t have clear line of sight into was the timing at which we would receive these benefits. Vivien Azer : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit of your thinking on pricing strategy for beer. I think you talked about -- you are in the market now for 1% to 2%. And I\u2019m wondering given your tremendous success in the market, have you changed your strategy? And I\u2019m asking that also because it appears that you led price increases in California and Texas at a minimum and that maybe a little bit of a divergence from in the past when -- and correct me if I\u2019m wrong where you are perhaps more of a follower. So is there change in strategy? Is there the potential, given again the strong demand for your product for perhaps more aggressive pricing to really further your premium image and get back to some of the price gaps of 10 years or so ago? And how are you thinking about your overall pricing architecture between the brands? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yeah. So, first of all, as it relates to pricing, it is pretty much what we\u2019ve said all along throughout the year, which is that we\u2019ve expected to take in the 1% to 2% pricing range and that\u2019s what we are doing. So the strategy really hasn\u2019t changed. I mean like every other business, we\u2019ve got costs to cover and our brands are strong enough to bear that kind of pricing. If there is any change in our strategy, I would say that the marketplace is changing somewhat in terms of sort of the makeup of the types of products that are out there. The market, I mean the industry is definitively premiumizing, while volume remains sort of flat so that there is a shift internally towards more premium products. And I would say that that probably has given us the opportunity to be less focused on what\u2019s going on with competitive products and to be more focused on what do we think is good for our brand and what do we think will work and won\u2019t work. So we continue to be very strategic in our pricing. We are doing it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. Our guidance nevertheless hasn\u2019t changed. We are still looking at the 1% to 2% range. And you can call it leading or not leading. We are sort of I would say marching to our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that\u2019s sort of up to them. And we will do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what\u2019s good for the health of our brands. So in some cases that will mean that we will lead pricing. But as I said, the market has changed, it\u2019s premiumizing. 10% of the industry now is craft, selling at very high prices, right. And the other 10% of the market is basically us. And those are the two segments, that 20% obviously taking share from the other 80%. So things are a little different out there than they have been in the past. Robert Ottenstein : Right. I mean, it\u2019s interest, if you look at the Corona brand outside of U.S. and Mexico, ABI is taking a very strong strategy of really making a super, super premium brand, generally priced significantly higher than Heineken for instance in most areas. Obviously, the reference point in Mexico is paramount. But did you think perhaps there is a way to kind of increase the gap with premium, with U.S. mainstream brands, with Corona, and just develop a little bit longer kind of pricing architecture for your brands, a little more differentiated than it is now? Rob Sands : Yes. I would say in general, we are not overly focused on the pricing gap with the domestic premiums. I mean, the domestic premiums have sort of taken on the life of their own. I am not sure how relevant it is at this stage. Robert Ottenstein : All right. So that definitely sounds like a departure in strategy than what you had said a few years ago. Rob Sands : Yes. I would say that you have identified that nuisance correctly. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Terrific. Thank you very much. Rob Sands : We are less concerned about that gap today than we were several years ago. Robert Ottenstein : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Thanks. And congratulations, And Rob, your family must be incredibly proud to in 70 years to build a $26 billion company, that\u2019s amazing. Rob Sands : Well, thank you. Tim Ramey : David, just a clarification on the end pointing of the TSA was. I think I heard you say, is it end of calendar 2016 that you expect that to be largely wound down? David Klein : So we have -- in terms of supply chain procurement, not finished goods procurement we have largely separated ourselves from reliance on ABI. And then separately, we will continue to procure finished goods from ABI\u2019s breweries until June of next year of 2016. Tim Ramey : Great. And then Rob on the wine outlook, you said of the overall harvest but ultra-premium was a little bit short in Napa and Sonoma. I\u2019m just wondering if you think that might provide somewhat of a pricing umbrella for mid tier premium price products and any challenges you foresee in terms of pinot noir sourcing or some of the rates that are more. Rob Sands : So, I don\u2019t think we see any issues with pinot noir sourcing, which is doing quite a bit of it between Mark West, Robert Mondavi, the various tiers at Meiomi. But I would say that our supply chain is very well nailed down. And then I think to your question on the pricing in the marketplace, I think that pricing -- I mean, I think the answer to your question is maybe yes, yes. I think that even in the higher end -- I certainly don\u2019t see pricing going the other way. It hasn\u2019t been a very robust market over a number of years in terms of pricing but if you sort of listen to the talk out there and in industry type circles, I think everybody is sort of -- meaning, the market in general is probably more favorable to stop pricing than it has done in quite a number of years so. Tim Ramey : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just clarification on the 34% margins. Did you quantified as how much FX and commodity benefited that number and then, am I right in what you said with the hedges, we won\u2019t see any incremental benefit in the back half? I mean, this is probably the watermark for the rest of the year. Rob Sands : Yes. So, clearly implied in the guidance that brings us back into the 34% range, margins will compress a little bit in the back half of the year as a result of several headwinds if you will. Those being bringing on -- bringing assets into service, our depreciation number will go up, line commissioning costs, incremental employees where training as well as throughput lowering as we go into the back half of the year at Nava just based on the seasonality of our production. So, I would say that built into the 34% is our current estimate of FX and commodity rates for the rest of the year. Bill Chappell : Okay. But just trying to understand it, especially on the commodity front. Would you expect as we move past the hedges that you would see an incremental benefit as we move into next year or is it less on, is it more on productivity benefits than it is freight, commodities? Rob Sands : It\u2019s a little bit of both. And so from a hedging perspective, we run a three-year layering program and so we are -- we kind of stabilize our returns a little bit, which means you leave some money on the table when commodity prices and FX values are falling and you gain on the other sides. So, I would say that we will get, assuming commodity rates were to stay where they are today and primarily for us, we are talking about benefiting from diesel rates as well as aluminum. But assuming those rates were to stay as they are today, there would be some benefit that we would experience next year. It\u2019s just far too early to call what that is at this point. Bill Chappell : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Pablo Zuanic : Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of questions on Modelo Especial. The first point is that to me, the brand to bottle and the can are really totally different products. It\u2019s a different demographic, it\u2019s a different price point and obviously it\u2019s a different packaging. And I\u2019m just trying to understand how can they work in the long-term? The person buying the cheap Modelo Especial can is very different from the one that you are advertising [its active] [ph] for the bottle? And the second question, which is related to this also. Obviously, Modelo Especial is driving the growth. You provided ACVs for cans and bottles? Can you give some color in terms of what\u2019s the growth in bottles? What the growth in cans? I understand the bottles are starting from a lower base. But the reason I ask the question is that, when you say 65% ACV for Modelo Especial, I\u2019m not too sure there\u2019s a big market for Modelo Especial in states like Alabama or South Carolina. So because your ACV has already capped on Modelo Especial and the cans or maybe not, I mean, obviously given the growth rate, it hasn\u2019t. But just give some color there, I find the brand is a fascinating brand where the business will [case divvy] [ph], but it has its own challenges because of the way the cans and the bottles are marketed. Thanks. Rob Sands : Well, first think I would say that from a consumer experience standpoint, our research and the feedback that we receive is that as more people in the U.S. become expose to Modelo Especial, they tend to continue to drink it. So it\u2019s a very high quality well respected authentic brand from Mexico. To address you\u2019re -- the can versus bottle component, we had depletions year-to-date on cans that are 12-ish percent on the can part of the portfolio and then bottles it\u2019s, we were in the high 20% growth rate from a depletion standpoint. So, we\u2019re seeing growth coming across the spectrum of offerings on Modelo Especial. David Klein : Yeah. And I would say that as far as the consumer goes, I\u2019m not sure that we agree with you that it\u2019s two completely different consumer bases. I think that we\u2019ve seen a shift somewhat at least in the growth from cans to bottles. The can is only slightly priced less than the bottle. It\u2019s really almost irrelevant the pricing difference. Interestingly enough cans have in general taken on a very premium image since it\u2019s becoming the package of choice in the craft segment of the market. So the whole view towards cans in general I would say is shifting quite significantly from a consumer perspective. So we don\u2019t see any difficulties in marketing the cans and the bottles together, like everybody else does markets cans and bottles. So that\u2019s not a particularly unique aspect of our Modelo Especial business, which, as we said earlier, is actually growing more than it ever has on an incredibly large base. So the strength of that brand is phenomenal at this stage without it really having fully transitioned to a general market product and it is transitioning to a general market product. Again, with our own help as we turned on general market TV advertising, which has been very successful and we know that there is huge room for distribution growth in that brand and you will see it. You will see it as we continue to move forward and execute with that brand. You\u2019ll see the ACV continue to go up. That\u2019s simply going to be the case as we believe quite strongly at the current time. So the cans are strong. The bottles are strong. It\u2019s following the same pattern as many brands that have become a major brands and Corona is probably the best example of that. Pablo Zuanic : That\u2019s very helpful color. Can I just ask a follow-up? With all this talk about Anheuser-Busch InBev, SABMiller transaction if it happens. If I recall about 65% your volumes in the U.S. go through MillerCoors wholesalers, obviously they are independent, the balance mostly on Anheuser-Busch InBev? I know it\u2019s very hypothetically and speculative, but in high again, work to be involve in anyway in the future with MillerCoors or most on -- or the Molson Coors? There could be some changes at the wholesaler level, right? I will assume that they would want the MillerCoors wholesalers to carry their portfolio of Mexican brands, of course, the wholesalers will have their own sales and your business is much larger? But is there reason there number one? And the second question would be in terms of your volume in the U.S. at the wholesaler level what percentage would overlap with the Spencer brands or pretty much wholesalers will carry your brands, don\u2019t carry the Spencer brands? Thanks and sorry all the detail there. Rob Sands : Yeah. So, we -- there is some overlap of wholesalers, they carry the Spencer brands or the Heineken/Spencer brands and ourselves, quite a bit of overlap in fact. I would say that that is totally irrelevant to us. The Spencer brands are small, okay, and in terms of growth they have some growth in the [indiscernible] brand, which is less than half the size for instance of Modelo Especial and growth is slowdown. And Tecate I think is a negative territory and they\u2019ve had some growth in Tecate Light with basically -- which basically sells at the domestic premium price point. So we don\u2019t really view that as a particularly strong competition and we don\u2019t really care whether they are in MillerCoors or ABI or frankly, where they go, because we don\u2019t focus on that portfolio very much and Heineken\u2019s a whole different animal obviously. Pablo Zuanic : Right. Yeah. Rob Sands : I think is competing with a different consumer base in general than our Mexican portfolio. So, again, it\u2019s not something that we really focused on. And then in general, our modus operandi is to worry more about our portfolio and the opportunities there, and execution is going to be the key on our portfolio in the future, which is going to be about taking advantage of distribution opportunities. And basically increasing the number of SKUs per account, I mean, that\u2019s really what we where the opportunity lies for us, because we actually generate a huge amount of growth for ourselves and our retailers with a relatively small amount of shelf presence and we\u2019re under SKU-ed given our velocity and our dollar volume at retail. So there is just a big opportunity there for us and our retailers. Our retailers are and should be interested in increasing their sales and margin per unit space -- per unit space of shelf space. That\u2019s what they are all about and probably their biggest opportunity to do that and to get dollar sales turns and even more importantly margin is through increased SKU and shelf space for our portfolio. So -- and you know, when we talk to retailers about that, I think they realize the statistics are just overwhelming for them as a way to increase their profitability. So building our SKU count per retail account is going to be one of our primary focuses going forward. Pablo Zuanic : Thank you. It was very helpful. Operator : Our final question comes from line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper : Thanks guys. Two questions on the Beer business. Can you talk about what your volume assumption is for capacity planning for the Beer business going forward? And then we have seen the cans come in and if memory serves, ACV has gotten pretty stable over the last few months. Where do you see the potential for distribution on Corona can in the medium term? Rob Sands : Yeah. I think in terms of capacity, it\u2019s sort of like high single digit is what we have said in the past. So you could infer that right from sort of a -- our comments about doubling the business over a long period of time, 10 years, that just sort of simple math. Our real guidance for the year continues to be high single digits for the Beer business in general. And then your second question was? Brett Cooper : How much more room is there for distribution on Corona can? Rob Sands : A lot. We\u2019ve just introduced it really and made it a priority over the last relatively short period of time. So I think that there is a big opportunity for more distribution on that. Right, it\u2019s only about 5% of our volume at the current time and we should be growing that to more like 15% or 20%. So that will be achieved through continuing to build distribution and doing what I said, focusing on SKUs per count. Brett Cooper : Perfect. Thanks Operator : That was our final questioner. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. As we close the discussion of our second quarter results for fiscal 2016, I\u2019m very, very pleased with what our business has achieved so far. Though the year is far from complete, our new guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to execute in the second half and achieve our goals for the full year. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early January when we will share the results of our third quarter. Until then we wish you a safe and happy holiday season. This time of the year is a great opportunity to share our fine beer, wine and spirits products with friends and family. And we encourage you to make Constellation Brands a part of your celebrations this holiday. So thanks again everybody and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Constellation Brands\u2019 Third Quarter FY'16 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s conference call. In addition to our third quarter fiscal '16 results and outlook, we will also discuss our Mexicali and Nava brewery projects and their related outlook. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news releases or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during the Q&A session today to two questions per person. This has been our practice for the last few quarters and helps us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance, and now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks Patty, and good morning and happy New Year to everybody. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2016 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I am pleased to report that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation's stock increasing more than 45% for calendar year 2015 versus the S&P 500, which declined 1% for the year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. I believe this excellent stock price performance is being driven by our strong financial results led by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and strong prospects for future growth. It is because of this tremendous growth opportunity that we're making smart investments now to ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control, and flexibility to help us meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. These investments include the construction of a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Details of our plans were announced earlier this morning. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with future scalability to 20 million hectoliters. The Mexicali location is ideal given its close proximity to the State of California, Constellation's largest beer market. The new brewery is being built with similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava brewery and is designed to ensure consistency in brewing and production processes with the highest level of product quality expected between the two facilities. Let's take a moment to discuss the progress at our Nava facility, which had production capacity of 10 million hectoliters with the ability to expand at the time we acquired it. As previously discussed, we currently have work underway to expand Nava to 25 million hectoliters by the summer of calendar 2017 via three incremental 5 million hectoliter expansions. In addition to our plans to build the Mexicali brewery, we also announced today that we have plans to further expand Nava with a 2.5 million hectoliter capacity expansion that will bring production from 25 to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed in early calendar year 2018. Now, I am pleased to report that as expected our first incremental 5 million hectoliters of Nava production capacity recently became operational and is in the process of ramping to optimal capacity utilization levels. We now have 15 million hectoliters of functioning brewing capacity at Nava. Two packaging lines have been running to support this new brewing capacity and ramp up to full utilization is expected shortly for these lines, which will provide additional capacity for premium glass products like Modelo Especial and Coronitas. The second incremental 5 million hectoliters of new brewing capacity at Nava is underway with this piece of the expansion to be expected to be completed by June of this year and work continues on the third expansion phase as we increase Nava production capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capability around the site with completion expected by the summer of calendar 2017. As these expansion activities continue, we've worked with ABI to extend the interim supply agreement we currently have in place for finished goods in order to support our robust growth and enable a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This agreement is expected to remain in place through June 2017 for a select number of products. They\u2019re expected to represent about 15% to 20% of the company's need for the U.S. marketplace. Overall, we remain on track with all expansion activities, and I am excited to be in a position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform to support the industry-leading growth levels of our incredible beer business. Our additional investments in production capacity are designed to ensure that we're well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in the mid-to-high single digit range and is expected to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. Our third quarter beer results are a testament to this momentum. As we achieved depletion growth of more than 16% leading volume gains amongst all U.S. brewers and outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports with double digit growth achieved by nearly every brand, every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion in consumer takeaway trends during the quarter by gaining distribution for key packages, accelerating velocities behind investments in media and merchandizing and continuing to grow the can format, which represented nearly 25% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. Marketing initiatives for the brand included Corona Football with Jon Gruden, two major boxing matches, general market and Hispanic TV advertising throughout the fall, football, tailgating season, and the airing of the O Tannenbaum holiday spot for the 25th consecutive year. Modelo Especial also delivered accelerating depletion growth of more than 20% during the third quarter with all core Especial packages growing double digits. This brand's media investments included the continuation of Modelo Especial National English Language TV and video campaign with the addition of sports programming during the start of the NFL Season across CBS, FOX, ESPN, and ESPN 2. And National Hispanic Media continued throughout the quarter with weekly TV exposure to Spanish language consumers. Now given some of these marketing highlights, it\u2019s important to note that the beer team was recently recognized by earning a top spot on Ad Age's 2015 Marketer's A list. Constellation is the only beer wine and spirits company to make the list and I\u2019m very, very proud of this accomplishment. Collectively these activities resulted in Modelo Especial becoming the number one dollar share gainer amongst established U.S. beer brands in the IRI channels during the third quarter followed by Corona Extra as the number two share gainer. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. David will have more to say about this in a few moments. When you put all of these pieces together, the exceptional growth of strong consumer demand for our Mexican beer brands, the exciting opportunity to invest in Mexico to expand our brewery operations, and the on-schedule progress we're making to meet our expansion goals, it is clearly an exciting time at Constellation where the opportunities to build upon our growth as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer segment keeps getting better and better. As you know, we acted upon another such opportunities for the future growth and we entered the U.S. craft beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that will enable Constellation to compete in the fast growing Craft Beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Now Ballast Point is currently growing at more than 125% in IRI channels and remains on track to sell nearly four million cases and generate approximately $115 million in net sales for calendar 2015, representing growth of more than 100% versus the prior calendar year. I\u2019m pleased to welcome the Ballast Point Founder, Jack White and the entire Ballast Point team to Constellation and now I would like to discuss the business results for our Wine and Spirits business. In our Wine and Spirits business during the third quarter, we achieved earnings growth and strong margin expansion driven primarily by the Meiomi Wine acquisition as well as favorable mix and COGS trend. As I mentioned last quarter, we have successfully integrated into our New Meiomi Wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and our efforts to expand distribution are working to drive incremental growth for the brand. As a matter of fact, the most recent IRI trends corresponding with our quarterly results show that the Meiomi Pinot Noir is growing more than 80% in IRI channels, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand this past summer. Third quarter depletions for the brand were also strong across all channels growing more than 50%. Meiomi Pinot Noir is one of the hottest wines of the year listed as Number 20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 Wines for 2015 and number one on wine.com\u2019s Top 100 list which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Just this quarter we began shipping the 2014 vintage -- 2014 vintage of Meiomi chardonnay following the success of the 2013 chardonnay in the marketplace. Our Mark West brand is also known as a leader in the premium Pinot Noir category and we\u2019re pleased to announce that the new line extension Mark West Black is now shipping. This higher priced tier of the Mark West brand welcomes consumer to the dark side of Pinot Noir with a more full bodied and rich taste profile. And one of our newer brand Tom Gore Vineyards is regaining consumer acceptance for its high quality in authentic second generation grape farmer brand story. It has also been featured in publications like Wine Enthusiasts celebrating wine around the world in the Wall Street Journal's My Ride series. Our focused brands are gaining again driving positive results for the quarter in our Wine and Spirits portfolio led by brands like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is America\u2019s favorite Cabernet holding the number one Cabernet Sauvignon position with the highest dollar and volume sales. Other focus brand leaders include Kim Crawford, which was named number one or number 11, I\u2019m sorry, on wine.com's top 100 wines of 2015 and The Dreaming Tree, which launched its Pinot Noir varietal earlier this year. Our luxury brand, Antares, continued to maintain their reputation for excellence among the critics, with outstanding reviews breaking 90-plus scores for our brands like Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi and Mt. Veeder from publications like The Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiasts and Wine and Spirits. During the quarter our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2% driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber peach flavor as well as SVEDKA Vodka Mango Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade flavors. Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains and was recently awarded a 94 point score in the Wine Enthusiasts and a top 10 best Tequila designation by liquor.com. In closing, it is certainly shaping to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the year quickly drawing to a close, I\u2019m very pleased with our progressed to date. Our efforts have produced a year of strong financial performance, notable business and brand milestones, industry accolades and healthy growth within several areas of the business. I\u2019m particularly pleased that we have finalized our investment plans in Mexicali, Mexico to support the future growth we\u2019ve seen within our beer business and we're working intelligently on the Nava brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the commercial side of the beer business. In Calendar 2015 amid all of our hardworking accomplishments achieved throughout the year we also celebrated the 70th anniversary of our Company founding. While we are proud of our most recent accomplishments taking a longer view of our 70-year heritage gives us perspective of how far we have come and even greater results to continue challenging our own expectations as we look forward to the next 70 years. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our third quarter results. David Klein : Thank you, Rob and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with some Q3 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 15%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results for the quarter. The strong beer performance along with some slight favorability in our tax rate and better than expected Meiomi results are driving our full year fiscal '16 comparable basis diluted EPS projection up to a range of $5.30 to $5.40 versus our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.20. Operational activities related to brining new capacity online at Nava continue to progress as planned. And the beer business performance timing of capital expenditures related to the Nava expansion and lower than planned income tax payments are helping to increase our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection to a range of $475 million to $525 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $300 million. In addition to our quarterly results we recently completed the Ballast Point Craft beer acquisition and this morning we outlined our plans to build a new $10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali, Mexico and further expand our Nava brewery. Let\u2019s take a closure look at all of this activity starting with our Q3 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 6% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 16%. Beer net sales increased 8% on volume growth that came in a little under 7%. Beer net sales growth for the quarter was impacted by the overlap of a shift of approximately $2 million cases and $37 million of net sales from Q2 fiscal '15 into Q3 fiscal '15 related to the beer product recall. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of fiscal '15 to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. Even the Q3 fiscal '15 overlap just mentioned, it is worth noting that beer net sales growth for the first nine months of fiscal '16 totaled 11% and we now expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Wine and Sprits' net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects favorable mix across the business. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated approximately $35 million of incremental sales during the quarter. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $89 million up 13% with gross margin increasing 280 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $58 million primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS. Our beer gross profit margin increased 360 basis points to 48.9%. Wine and Spirits' gross profit was up $31 million. This primarily reflects the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition, favorable mix and lower COGS. Wine and Spirits' gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 43.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $29 million. This reflects marketing investments made by the Beer and Wine and Spirits businesses. Corporate expense was up due primarily through an increase in payroll related taxes associated with employee stock option exercises, higher incentive compensation expense and investments to support the growth of the business including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer of Function. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $61 million and consolidated operating margin improved 210 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 360 basis points to 35.1% and Wine and Spirits' operating margin improved 170 basis points to 27.5%. Equity earnings increased $6 million due to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the quarter was $76 million down 12%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of November our debt totaled $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.9 billion, a decrease of $326 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5 times at the end of Q3. Even with the funding of the Ballast Point acquisition, we expect to end fiscal '16 below the four times level. Additionally, we continue to expect fiscal '16 interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 32.3% compared to 29.2% last year, which reflected the benefit of certain tax credits. We now expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. Now let\u2019s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal '16, we generated $578 million of free cash flow compared to $209 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.1 billion versus $750 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily generated by the Beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the Beer business and lower projected income tax payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. CapEx for the first nine months of fiscal '16 totaled $514 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending from the same timeframe last year. While our initial $10 million hectoliter expansion at Nava continues to progress as planned, payment timing for some of the capital expenditures associated with this activity has shifted into fiscal 2017. In a few moments, I will outline the CapEx requirements we're targeting for the New Mexicali brewery and the additional 2.5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava. Even with the incremental capital expenditures projected from these initiatives, we are decreasing our total capital expenditure estimate for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million versus our previous guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. Now let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5.30 to $5.40. Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Meiomi\u2019s volume performance has exceeded our initial expectations and we now expect fiscal '16 diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to be around $0.07 to $0.08 versus our previous $0.03 to $0.04 accretion projection. The beer business is the primary driver of our diluted EPS guidance increase. We now expect volume growth of 10% to 12%, a net sales growth of 12% to 14% and operating income growth in the range of 22% to 24% before any benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. We closed the Ballast Point acquisition in December. We funded the $1 billion purchase price with a combination of net proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.75% senior notes during 2025, followings under our accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash on hand. For Calendar 2015, Ballast Point is expected to sell nearly $4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in sales. On a comparable basis the acquisition is expected to be neutral to diluted EPS for fiscal '16 and $0.05 to $0.06 accretive for fiscal '17. Our current beer segment guidance as is targeting beer operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% for fiscal '16. The improvement versus our previous 34% target primarily relates to Q3 benefiting from lower depreciation as well as lower line commissioning and optimization cost than originally anticipated. Now that this incremental capacity has become operational, we expect these costs to ramp up in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that we have already achieved our mid 30% operating margin goal for our beer business. We expect the beer operating margin to continue to run in the mid 30% range over the next one to two years as we still have much to accomplish at Nava and expect some margin volatility as we bring online and optimize new capacity. As Rob mentioned earlier, we have extended the interim supply agreement with ABI to ensure a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This could temper our operating margin expansion in fiscal '17 as utilization at Nava will likely run below the utilization targeted before the extension of the supply agreement. Speaking up capacity Rob also outlined our plans to build a new $10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali and further expand capacity at our Nava brewery. In the press release we issued this morning we included a table summarizing the collective investments we're marking in our Mexican operating platform. Let me provide a few highlights around the capital expenditures associated with this activity starting with Nava. The additional $2.5 million hectoliters we are adding to Nava is estimated to cross approximately $250 million. This combined with our previously announced Nava brewery and glass plant expansion projects puts our total targeted Nava capital expenditures at $2.5 billion. After fiscal '16 we expect to spend $1.1 billion over the fiscal '17 and '18 timeframe with most of that occurring in fiscal '17. The new 10 million hectoliter Mexicali brewery is expected to cost $1.5 billion and associated land, water rights and infrastructure and other site requirements to accommodate scalability to 20 million hectoliters is estimated at $500 million. For this total $2 billion investment, we expect some initial spend to occur in fiscal '16, a little over half of the spend to come in fiscal '17 and '18 and the remaining spend to happen in the fiscal '19 to fiscal '21 timeframe. Given the strong demand we see for our beer portfolio and our best-in-class margin profile, the investments I just outlined are expected to generate high returns with a fast payback. Even with the capital requirements associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings in operating cash flow will allow us to operate below our targeted four times leverage range and continue to provide us with significant capital allocation flexibility. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey good morning. So it's obviously been a great couple of years here on the beer business for steady acceleration. I was hoping maybe you could take a step back on the Modelo Especial brand which has driven a lot of the growth and peel back how much of that growth has been driven by distribution expansion in the last couple of years versus organic sales growth per distribution point? And then more importantly, how sustainable is that as you look going forward over the next few years in both buckets and particularly in terms of how much distribution expansion is left to the brand? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes clearly it\u2019s been both. It\u2019s been both distribution and expansion as Modelo Especial as I\u2019ll say migrated to the general market, and as of course we have begun our general market advertising for the brand and Velocity has also increased. So, I think that there is plenty of room left for Modelo Especial distribution expansion. It does not have the ACV of, say Corona Extra. Right now the ACV on Modelo Especial is about 65%. So we see lots of room for continued expansion in both distribution, and we see opportunity for expansion of Velocity, i.e. sales per point of distribution as the brand continues to gain momentum with general market consumers. So, this is a real growth story for beer in general not only just for Constellation brands, it\u2019s a phenomenon. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then on the Corona brand that\u2019s obviously accelerated nicely this year or last year, I should say now, cans are driving a big piece of that, but it looks like glass is also doing very well and even more so probably if you assume some cannibalization on it. So we\u2019re just hoping for an update on what\u2019s driving the overall brand acceleration in your mind over the last few quarters here? Is it mainly cans or do you think there are other factors behind it and the sustainability of those factors going forward, thanks? Rob Sands : Well, cans only I think represented about 25% of the growth of Corona Extra. So, I shouldn\u2019t say only. It did represent a significant portion of the growth, but clearly cans has been very important, but growing more importantly is our continued increased investment in the brand behind our marketing activities as well as investments in SG&A, basically our sales organization as well. So we\u2019re investing, I would say even ahead of the growth on Corona Extra and we\u2019re investing very effectively probably more importantly in the brand. I've talked about the consistency of our advertising. Clearly, that advertising and marketing works, and therefore when we do invest more, we see the results of those investments. So it's a very strong brand with a very strong marketing campaign behind it. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Rob Sands : Hi Judy. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi how are you? So couple of questions, first just on the brewery capacity expansions, if I think about the expansion you\u2019re doing for the next few years, by end of Calendar '19, it looks like you will be getting to about 32.5 million hectoliters, which implies a CAGR of around mid teen level. So, I was just hoping to sort of get your color just in terms of how this jives with your volume outlook over the next few years and to the extent that if you see some changes in terms of that trajectory, how much flexibility do you have to either expand more quickly or scale back on that expansion? Rob Sands : Yes, so the only thing I would say about that and I will let David comment in more detail on it is that that's maximum capacity. Okay, no one runs breweries flat out 24/7. So I don\u2019t think that you can take those numbers and just assume that we\u2019re going to utilize 100% of the capacity. In fact, our important element of brewery expansion is to make sure that we have the total capacity okay to run these breweries at, I\u2019d say more normalized production levels as opposed to absolutely flat out which isn\u2019t the best way to run a brewery. So David did you want to comment more on that? David Klein : Yeah I\u2019d say from a growth rate perspective Judy, we\u2019re still focused on the high-single digit kind of growth rate that we're seeing in the high end beer business as being applicable to our business, right. So that\u2019s point one. So we\u2019re not expecting outsized growth beyond the high end of the beer business in order to support the capacity we're putting in. And I would say the second thing is that having the capacity in a redundant facility on the West Coast closest to our biggest market is actually very important to us, and in and of itself generates a return. Judy Hong : Okay. And then the second question is just on your Ballast acquisition and just broadly your craft beer strategy. So on the craft -- on the Ballast acquisition, I think some people have looked at the billion dollar price tag in the context of the current volume size and thought it was at the high end of some of the recent deals. So if you can sort of give us your view of why that price tag was appropriate and the growth opportunities perhaps beyond may be even distribution expansion that you see with Ballast? And then more broadly if you think about your ambition to really get bigger in the craft beer industry, do you think that you would have to have more collection of some of the more regional brands and expand distribution or more of a large scale kind of brand like Ballast and just getting more scale with that brand. Rob Sands : Yeah, so purchase price and size of the brand, first of all the purchase price is not related to the size of the brand. It's related to the growth percentage and the size of the brand, okay. So obviously the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right. As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI. So, when you look at purchase price at multiple as a function of growth rate, it\u2019s pretty reasonable, and we don\u2019t see that growth rate changing much in the short term. So, we expect another pretty robust year with Ballast Point. Also you\u2019ve got to realize that Ballast Point has the highest average retail selling price basically of any significantly size craft, right. If you go buy some Ballast Point, you\u2019re going to see the Ballast Point sales for around $15, $16 a six pack okay versus competitors that you'll see at under $10 or just a bit over $10 a six pack. So it\u2019s a very, very high growth, high margin product. Now, our strategy with Ballast Point is actually pretty simple and it's why we were so particularly interested in the brand, which is our strategy is we don\u2019t really have to do too much other than what they\u2019re doing right now. The key to Ballast Point is maintaining the growth, and I think the maintenance of the growth is going to be a function of maintenance of the award-winning stature and high quality of the brand. It's a very sought after product. All of the people, all of the people that have been involved in making Ballast Point what it is today continue that\u2019s Jack White the founder, it\u2019s Jim Buechler, the CEO, all of these people are brew masters. The incredible group of people that we have there continue to be 100% behind the brand and has continued very enthusiastically with Constellation. Part of the motivation for that wine to sell the business to Constellation was of all the buyers they saw Constellation as the best fit because of our incredibly strong position in the beer industry, and the fact that we're only a high end beer manufacturer and seller as well as being in the high end of the wine business, which makes us a completely different animal. Okay, we're not big beer okay in the sense of want to being one of the two U.S. premium domestic producers. So the strategy with Ballast Point is all about continuing to do what the company has been doing. And I would say bringing incrementally to that some of the areas where I think that Constellation can be of help and that would be with major key accounts, and I would say other places where a smaller company won\u2019t necessarily have the ability to play right off the bat. Judy Hong : Okay. It\u2019s $18.99 per six pack in Manhattan, but I hear you on the pricing point and thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations and also to the Crown Team, very impressive trends here. I guess two questions. Hey Rob two questions, one is just as you think about the third quarter depletion number of plus 16% and change, obviously a great number. Is there anything in that number that you think is unique to the quarter either weather or some particular practice you engaged in that, that would cause the depletion trend to take down? I really don\u2019t mean to get at like weather it\u2019s going to be 12% or 10% or 15% in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m just trying to get it like what's underlying the kind of performance that might go away as we all try to update our models and think about sustainable growth and then I had Ballast Point question after that. Rob Sands : Yes, Mark we try not to factor in weather all that much, but clearly a warmer fourth quarter was beneficial I think for our beer business. I would also say that we continued some of the activity that we had been working throughout the first two quarters related to marketing spend along with the NFL and within other venues to continue to drive the brands, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything outside of those items. Mark Swartzberg : That\u2019s great. Okay. And then on Ballast Point, I want to try to the probe a little bit more on the consumer proposition and we\u2019ve all seen the multiple and I still want to press here it\u2019s clear on what the distribution opportunity you present for a brand that already has some pretty clear distribution opportunities because of its award winning qualities. But I\u2019m kind of still stuck on the consumer proposition from a longer term perspective, when I hear you emphasize growth in a multiple and reminded of wine deals in the past going back far enough where growth was a rationale. And then when I look at the Craft Beer segment, I think the segment has been around for a long time and we argue over whether there is more than really one brand. Sam Adams has become a national brand and really has that sessionability associated with it. And then the price point and the IPA like these are not brands that you see people kind of having and you get a group of five people together. One is going to be having Skull and one's going to be having another craft beer. So it just doesn\u2019t seem to have lend itself to being a big brand away your imported beer portfolio does. So could you just speak about that consumer proposition and how you\u2019re thinking about that? Rob Sands : Yes, I think that there is opportunity okay for Ballast Point to become a big brand and when we say big okay, I think that that maybe a relative kind of a number. We\u2019re not talking volumetrically Bud Light big okay. Mark Swartzberg : Got you. Rob Sands : But versus where it is right now okay it can be a lot bigger and if you look at the competitors in the marketplace and where they are volumetrically okay that implies a huge amount of growth for Ballast Point. And obviously it\u2019s a kind of price point and margins that we\u2019re talking about, big is a relative term. So you look at some of the other competitors and we clearly see plenty of correct brands in the 10 to 30-plus million case ranges right and we start out at 4 million cases right now as we end the year with over 100% growth rate and incredible margins. So things are relative. I think that what we're really talking here financially is about the kind of contribution right economically and financially that Ballast Point can make to our bottom line. With all that said, maintaining the quality in the award winning position of the brand with craft consumers is going to be key to that and I\u2019m a 100% sure that the team that's running Ballast Point will do that. We have some unbelievable great new products that are coming out like a Watermelon, Dorado, which is Double IPA. These are very breakthrough products that I think are going to potentially set the craft well vis-\u00e0-vis the consumers on fire. So that\u2019s why it's been so successful. We\u2019ve got in an totally award winning team producing these products and an incredible innovation behind it. Mark Swartzberg : No, that\u2019s helpful. Then watermelon actually sounds like it will bring in women. So, okay, so that's very helpful. Okay, great. Thank you, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company. Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to follow up on Ballast Point as well and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up question on beer. So on Ballast, the growth is clearly remarkable. But as I understand it, the company did enter some new market. So I\u2019m curious as you guys think about fiscal '17 sustaining that growth like how much of your accretion expectation and topline expectations are dependent on new distribution opportunities? Rob Sands : Well, you\u2019re talking about this year? Vivien Azer : Yes for calendar '16, yeah. Rob Sands : Well, we obviously are giving guidance for our next fiscal year, but we don\u2019t see anything impeding our Ballast Point performance in general. There will continue to be expanded distribution and Ballast Point continues to increase its velocity per point of distribution even in its major markets where its already a big brand like its old market in San Diego. So, we don\u2019t see any real catalyst for change in that regard. The company will continue to expand its distribution and I think it will be very successful in doing so. Vivien Azer : Fair enough. That\u2019s perfect and then on beer, David I appreciate the two call outs in terms of kind of the disconnect between shipments and depletions being the bottler recall in the wholesaler inventory true up. But I\u2019m still having a hard time kind of getting comfortable with the delta given how large it was. Is there anything else that was driving that disconnect? David Klein : Yeah, I think we brought because depletions accelerated the way they did in Q3, our wholesaler inventory dropped a little bit kind of on a year-over-year basis and we\u2019re comfortable in getting those back in line by year end. So, I think that may be the other component if you feel there is a disconnect there, Vivien, but everything but we that\u2019s why we took our guidance up for the year basically across all of our P&L line items. Vivien Azer : Understood, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Like to switch over a little bit to the wine business. Two questions on wine. One big picture in terms of the industry, can you talk a little bit -- there is I guess is some data that there was a slowing of the wine industry in 2015. So perhaps you can address that and trends in pricing? And then second more specifically on Meiomi, perhaps give us a little bit of color in terms of what you're doing differently with the brand and why it's beating your expectations? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yeah, I think it's the opposite Robert. The Wine industry has actually accelerated quite considerably and as probably as we sit here right now one of the most robust points that it's ever been and you look at IRI dollars for the last 12 weeks, the wine industry has accelerated over 6% growth. And probably even more importantly if you look at the Premium Plus Segment, which is a segment of $8 plus, okay, which is what we would be primarily interested in okay, the industry has accelerated to double digit growth in dollar terms over the last 12 weeks, 11.2% at the industry, okay. And then as it relates to Meiomi, okay number one basically the brand has a tremendous amount of momentum in and of itself. Okay, we bring a lot to that party. Obviously we bring distribution strength. We bring strength where we\u2019re major players, number one players for that matter with key customers. If you look at our position today in beverage alcohol, total beverage alcohol okay, which is really important and you look at major customers like the mass merchandisers like the big grocery chains, when you combine our beverage alcohol portfolio okay we tend to be a number one supplier certainly in terms of the kind of profit that we\u2019re providing these key customers. So that\u2019s been helpful in driving the Meiomi results as well and you know also I think like everything okay whether we\u2019re talking Corona, whether we\u2019re talking Modelo Especial, whether we\u2019re talking Meiomi, it\u2019s all about the consumer voting with their feet all right. Meiomi has just a tremendous amount of consumer acceptance and that\u2019s building. So it\u2019s a very, very strong brand and I've talked about this before somewhat of a unique taste profile for Pinot Noir and it\u2019s fitting squarely into what the consumer is looking for that kind of product. And price point everything, it\u2019s just a tremendous wine by the glass opportunity in higher end on premise venues. So it just meets every kind of criterion for success. Rob Ottenstein : No but in terms of your expectations you're saying it's looking like it's going to be a good bit more accretive than you thought. Is that because the distribution's going faster? There's an acceleration in velocity or how to think about that? Rob Sands : All the above. Rob Ottenstein : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. I think those were the best wine margins I've ever seen and I've been hanging around this company for a long time. Any further commentary that you would give us on that? Was there any significant contribution from spirits? Doesn't look like spirits was really the driver in the quarter. Rob Sands : Yes it\u2019s really premiumization of the portfolio. Tim and you know the wine industry, right now the high end of the wine industry is growing probably better than it\u2019s ever grown before and Meiomi fits right into that. It\u2019s part of our premiumization strategy and as we continue to drive product now in the call it $15 to $20 range, you\u2019re going to see margin expansion because those products have higher margins okay than the lower end of the business. And there continues to be a premiumization shift in the wine industry in general, which Meiomi puts full square into and our increase in margins is directly related to that, but right now the sweet spot of the industry has basically moved up into as I said that sort of $15 to $20 or even above range and margins are significantly better in that range. So we\u2019re operating rather some pretty good external conditions. Tim Ramey : Sounds good. Well we have some good 2015 bulk pinot. So have your people call my people from the Meiomi\u2026 Rob Sands : We'll give you a call, Tim. Tim Ramey : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan. John Faucher : Yes. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about, following up on Tim's question here, in terms of the mix impact as we look at the wine business going forward and the potential for, let's say, pricing on top of that. Or is it just going to continue to be the consumer trading up and how do you really track the value that they're getting as they trade up? Do you get better brand differentiation as they trade up and how are consumers really understanding that value equation as you get that mix trade up? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes so, yes, I would say that you do get higher quality definitely and perhaps more brand differentiation for sure as you trade up. Wine is a very unique product and there is a lot of differentiation between products and as you move up in price, you're definitely moving up in quality in terms of the type of grapes that are used to make the wine i.e. where do they come from? Did they come from the best places? It certainly comes from -- half of it comes from better places, okay as you move up the price scale and then how the wine is made in particular things that add quite a bit of cost to wine like how much oak is used, it's like, how much of the product is fermented on oak and age of barrels, quality of barrels, whether the wood came from etcetera. So those things both contribute to the quality of the product as well as contribute to the cost and the pricing of the product. What was your other question John? John Faucher : That basically covers it. And I guess, is it a similar consumer dynamic on the beer side on the wine side -- as we see on the wine side? Obviously, consumers have traded up on wine for years but it seems as though the overall impact on the pricing and the huge price -- the pricing differential as they trade up on beer seems even greater than the pricing differential on wine. I'm wondering if we can see something that pushes that wine differential even further from a mix standpoint. Does that make sense? Rob Sands : Well, I think so. I think you'll see trading up on wine is accelerating and I think that you\u2019ll continue to see it be extremely robust and I think that you'll continue to see us benefit from that trading up. And oh yeah, you asked about pricing in wine. We're doing -- we both have significant trading up going on within the portfolio and then for our sales growth is running considerably ahead of our volume growth, which is representative of that positive mix shift. And we\u2019re taking pricing where we think that its applicable and that would be in sort of the lower end of our portfolio for instance. Products like Vendange where we're not so focused on, I would say share and volume and there is opportunity to enhance profitability nominally and they're not the most strategic areas of the business. So we\u2019re now into an environment where we are getting the best of the both worlds in that regards. Beer, okay -- yes beer is becoming like wine. The high end of the beer business is a very exciting part of the business because there is huge trading up going on in beer. Okay the consumer is definitely premiumizing, it's premiumizing into our import. They're premiumzing into our import brand. And craft you see the high end of the beer business being very robust. You can see it coming right out of the premium part of the beer. We definitely think that that\u2019s going to continue and although the price differential seems big in beer, okay that\u2019s really in percentage terms okay, is still talking about like a super affordable luxury, way, way even more affordable than wine right. It's a big deal for the consumer to go into a grocery store and buy $225 bottle of wine that's $50 okay, but to trade up to Corona at a dollar a bottle versus whatever else they were purchasing at $0.50 or less a can big percentage increase, but fundamentally not something that takes the product outside of the realm of an affordable luxury. So I don\u2019t think the consumer, and the consumer is proving to be pretty insensitive to those kind of changes at those nominal prices. John Faucher : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Megan Cody of UBS. Megan Cody : Hi. Thanks. So obviously your guys pace of growth has been great but my question is as you try to deliver against that growth in the marketplace while also taking on two large scale manufacturing initiatives, while also trying to expand Ballast, how are you guys thinking about execution risk? For example, managing out of stock, service delivery, etcetera? Rob Sands : We have a very -- we have a lot of confidence in our supply chain in our Mexican beer business right. We\u2019ve been doing this a long time. So we have no concerns about our ability to continue to supply in the U.S. market over the foreseeable future. Thus far our Nava expansion has gone according to plan. We are on schedule and we continue to actually run a little bit ahead of schedule in certain areas in our production build-out. And then lastly on Ballast Point, we are keeping those businesses operating separately. We\u2019re allowing Jim and Jack and the team at Ballast Point to continue to run Ballast Point, working with our beer teams. But we\u2019re not integrating the sales teams in such a way that would cause us to lose focus either at point or in our import beer business. Megan Cody : Okay. All right. Thank you. And then actually I had a follow-up, an unrelated follow-up. Just from a free cash flow perspective, on one hand you guys are clearly delivering better than expected P&L results. But on the other, you're also increasing CapEx to fund that growth. So looking from a long-term perspective, how do those dynamics impact your free cash flow outlook for the next few years net of this CapEx and then how do you see that being deployed? David Klein : We believe that we can do -- complete the Nava expansion, complete the Mexicali expansion, stay well within our four times leverage ratio range and still have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend and do share repurchases and we will remain opportunistic around M&A. Megan Cody : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually [Sveto Stefanovich] on behalf of Pablo. We have two questions, please. First, you disclosed beer depletions of 16% but this canned data is pointing to a 20% growth. We realize this difference has been there in recent quarters also. So does this mean that given that your on-premise business is about 15% of sales that your on premise business is down by about 6%? And if this is the case, why would there be such a big gap between your on-premise performance and your off-premise performance? David Klein : Yes so there is not that bit of a gap between our on-premise and off-premise performance. The IRI measures you\u2019re looking at measure A portion of the off-premise channel not the entirety of it and then when you look at on-premise, we are up in mid to high single digits in the on-premise even though the on-premise channel itself is flat to slightly down. So yes, there is a disconnect between the IRI and depletions, but I would hypothesize that in particular in our beer business that depletion are the best measure of the performance of our business. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. And the second question is, we have been doing a lot of work looking at your beer market share by state and we realize that in border states like New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, you're below you're average national share. And given the demographics, we would expect you to have higher share there. So the question is, should we assume that those states represent a significant distribution expansion opportunity for you or is there something structural that explains the lower shares? Thank you. David Klein : Yeah I think that it depends on the state, California which is obviously a border state right, we have some of our highest shares right. Southern California our shares are over 20% versus our national share and therefore, twice as much. In other places yeah there is plenty of opportunity, but traditionally our business has been focused on those places and we have tremendous share in the largest population area in the country bordering Mexico which is Southern California. Unidentified Analyst : Right. David Klein : Is there opportunity in Texas and Arizona as you've suggested? Yes sure, big opportunity. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan. Carla Casella : Hi. I'm wondering on the financing side do you contemplate coming back to the market this year and next to pre-fund some of the expansions you've got planned? Rob Sands : So Carla, we feel comfortable that we will be able to fund the expansion out of operating cash flows. What I would say is that we will likely at least consider our options in coming to the market so that we can continue to layer in a nice maturity ladder of 10 year notes as it makes sense to us. In particular we have a note coming due next September that we would -- that we'll possibly look to come to the market to refinance. Carla Casella : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. Needless to say we're incredibly pleased with our fiscal 2016 year-to-date results. Our beer business has tremendous, tremendous momentum and continues to gain market share and our high return investment in beer production capacity position us to support the significant growth in this business. We're growing EBIT and have significantly improved margins in our wine and spirits business. During our next quarterly call, which is scheduled for early April, we will provide guidance for our upcoming fiscal year. In the interim, we'll be working diligently to continue to execute our strategy and deliver excellent results for the remainder of the year. Thank you again everybody for your participation. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands' third quarter FY'16 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As usual I would like to limit everybody to two questions today so that we can end the call on time. Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our yearend call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable value generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016. Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and sell a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes eight wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business, and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities. This morning we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of five highly rated wines led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. Its other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold, and Thorn, with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015. The Prisoner is currently the number one super luxury red blend, growing in almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, the Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enables us to capitalize on US market trends that favor high end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands. So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have under way for fiscal 2017. Overall I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. Meiomi Pinot Noir was one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as Number 20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and Number 1, that's good, on wine.com's Top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Last fall we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the US beer market. In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately three times that of any major competitor. Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially this brewery will we built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year end calendar 2015, and we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018. Now these investments in Mexicali and Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future, and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the US beer market. Now organizationally we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people while insuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Now let's move now to excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the number one contributor to growth in the total US beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the number one share gainer in the high end segment of the US beer market in calendar 2015. More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, these brands are two of the hottest brands in the industry, and delivered 25% of US beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the number one imported beer brand for almost 20 years, and today is the number five beer brand overall in the US industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country, as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top five US beer brand to grow share for the year. Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last five years, with the can launch accounting for about 1/3rd of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles. In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments, as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans, as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represent less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays including Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day. Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the number one dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the number eight beer overall in the US market in total dollar sales, up from the number nine position last year. The size of this brand has doubled in just five short years, and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017 our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution, because despite being the number two import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year, with the draft format increasing almost 50%. Yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the US carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum. Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV, and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL matchups. Together we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth. I also want to call out Corona Light, which remains the number one imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on this brand has accelerated every year for the last five years, with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile live spots during NHL playoff broadcasts this spring and sponsorships of national major league baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light will continue to be a big point of emphasis, as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality, and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year is to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. Overall, I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point. From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016 we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality, and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well under way, with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget. As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity. Now over the next few months we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results. With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And, as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone, and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best in class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for a sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there. And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016 we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results, and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals, while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year. Sales growth in the US benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focus brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter of fact, many of our focus brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. Seven of our brands were featured on Impact's annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest pinot noir for the current 12 week and 52-week periods, and Kim Crawford recently emerged as the number one sauvignon blanc in IRI channels. Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards in which four of our brands achieved Fast Track status, recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named Rising Stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards, and six were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the number one imported vodka in the entire US. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend, Ravage, is a dark fruit forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September. Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year, and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people and places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which boasts an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in bourbon barrels; and Ruffino's Sparkling Rose, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported rose wines. For the year our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, as well as SVEDKA vodka. Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging, a new marketing campaign, and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. Our marketing campaign, The Noble Pursuit, features digital spots that highlight the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our number one imported vodka, SVEDKA with a new addition to our lineup of flavors, cucumber lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think cucumber lime will be a great addition to the track record of success, and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid single digit sales growth and mid to high single digits profit growth for the year. So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth margin enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements, and lower grape costs. Overall we are committing people, technology, and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017. David Klein : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8 times even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point, and returned cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock. We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year, as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth, while we continue to invest in our world class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%. Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth coming in over 12%. Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid December. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum, as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing, and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%. Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, an increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity, and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business, as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%. Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16 versus four times at the end of fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year. Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate, as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong, with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing and the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year. Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate. Beer operating income increased 29% primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter, primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth, and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend. Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow, compared to $362 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17. This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of 6.05 to 6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16. In fiscal '17 we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing, and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the interim supply agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity. Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp-up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs, and employee hiring. These costs along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offsetting the margin benefits I just outlined. Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17. For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth, as we are forecasting some mixed benefits. In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29%, and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $206 million. This does not assume additional stock repurchases. We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures, as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico. In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects, and fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represent the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represents a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile, and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted three to four times leverage range. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Rob Sands : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : I just wanted to flush out the reasoning for the potential Canadian wine IPO. It's a small piece of corporate EBIT. So it seems like it won't have much direct valuation impact. Is the motivation there more to potentially highlight the US wine business as undervalued here, or are there other reasons behind it? And any thoughts in general around the notion of going full monty and splitting up the entire wine and spirits business from beer down the road, it would be helpful for any commentary there? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes, so the Canadian IPO is really, assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. Number one, we think that\u2019s sort of buried in the whole company in the wine and spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective. And that if we treat it more as a standalone entity, the fact that it is a very high performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible, that's number one. So we think that that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. Number two, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us. As I said an IPO of a part of the - of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands and our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO as helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things. It is an interesting business, it\u2019s got strong growth. We built an improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great standalone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business - our wine and spirits business remains very strong, as you've seen in the results, we had fantastic leverage, P&L leverage in that business this year, we had tremendous margin expansion in that business. Even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business, we posted operating profit margin in the mid 20%s, which is fantastic for any business in any industry. A mid 20%s operating profit margin was the kind of leverage and growth and EBIT that we're getting in that business. So really no implications relative to the rest of the business. But we think that as I said as a standalone business it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the beer margin side, the commentary made sense in terms of the puts and takes looking at the upcoming fiscal year. But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera would be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4. So is the flat guidance just conservatism with greater uncertainty than you would usually have with the Nava ramp up. And can you give us a sense of some of the negatives you mentioned, like the Ballast SG&A, the higher marketing, and hiring? David Klein : Yes, so generally, Dara, first of all there are a lot of moving parts as it relates to a buildup of our operating margin in the beer business, and in particular in the work that\u2019s being done at Nava. So as we said for the last year really, we're going to see headwinds in margin expansion at Nava as a result of incremental depreciation expense, line commissioning costs, employee hiring, as we bring capacity on, but we don't necessarily get the throughput through the facility. I would say that while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you'll recall we did extend although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI which dampened some of the near term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Russ Miller : Hi, good morning, this is Russ Miller on for Nik. Could you more specifically compare the top line growth profiles of the US and Canadian wine businesses? David Klein : Russ, we're struggling to hear you actually. Russ Miller : I apologize. I was just wondering for more color, if you could compare the top line growth between the US and Canadian wine businesses? Rob Sands : Compared to what, Russ? Higher in Canada than in the US. Russ Miller : Okay. And then as a follow up, what are some of the key areas of focus for Bill Newlands as he takes over leadership of the wine and spirits business? Rob Sands : Well, it's the things that have been driving and that drove the results this year. He's got to continue to focus on those same things. So it's all about like premiumization, it's about driving mix, it's about driving our higher margin brands and our newly acquired brands like Prisoner, like Meiomi, driving the organic growth of our really high margin focus brands, good examples being Kim Crawford, that's number one. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer, and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be in sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix. And again, this is the sweet spot of growth in the beverage alcohol business. So it's pretty straightforward, and then it's you know, sort of I'd say day to day bread and butter stuff. COGS, control over COGS, costs and growth has been an important driver of our financial results there, as well as other expense items in the P&L. So he will continue to focus on those things as well. Good news is that he's doing a really great job and we're extremely optimistic obviously given our guidance for next year that we'll continue to be very successful in those areas. Russ Miller : That's excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Thank you, good morning. Rob Sands : How are you, Judy? Judy Hong : So first on beer sales guidance for fiscal '17, I guess historically, it seemed like you were a little bit more conservative at the outset of the year in terms of looking at the beer depletion. And it looks like this time the 10% to 13% organic sales guidance for beer lapping some of the tougher comps in the back half seems actually not as conservative. So just wanted to understand maybe a little bit more just in terms of is it really the momentum behind all of your brand that you're seeing that gives you confidence, how big a factor would continue distribution gains on the cans be really a factor in terms of driving that sales growth momentum in '17 for your beer business? David Klein : Well Judy, I think that it's of the things you mentioned around beer growth, it's both of those things. We think the brands continue to have very strong momentum. We continue to see that even as we're into the New Year in terms of IRI. There is a lot of distribution gain activity or a lot of space we can gain in terms of distribution in the coming year. We do expect continued growth of cans and again, our objective remains to drive our can volume up in aggregate into that mid-teens kind of range of total volume over time. I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year to guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year, and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we produced. And again I think you do need to focus on the organic depletion number, which is - or the organic net sales number, which is the 10% to 13% because I think combined with our 1% to 2% pricing guidance, you get to a fairly respectable, but achievable volume number. Judy Hong : Got it, okay. And then I guess the second question is around your capital allocation/acquisition strategy. So it seems like maybe every quarter or maybe just more recently we're getting a bit more just in terms of some of these acquisitions. Certainly in 2017, just given where your leverage level is, you also have a lot of dry powder in terms of continuing to either return cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. So is there a big pipeline in terms of these potential acquisitions that you see across both high end and craft spirits and beer side of the business? If those don't materialize would you be willing to return even more cash to shareholders in 2017? And what's embedded in terms of your guidance? David Klein : So I would say, Judy, we are seeking all the time to methodically and consistently drive shareholder value. And so we look at all of the tools in the tool box that we have to do that. And yes, in some instances it's in acquisition like The Prisoner or Meiomi. And I would say that early returns on Meiomi and Ballast Point are very positive, from a shareholder return standpoint we expect to see the same results, from an execution standpoint, from The Prisoner transaction you can see that we do remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as evidenced by a 29% increase in our dividend. And we will continue to look at share repurchases when we can stay within our leverage, our targeted leverage range, and we can be opportunistic in the market. And remember that the guidance that we gave assuming 206 million shares outstanding assumes no additional share repurchases at this point. Judy Hong : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Rob Sands : Hi, Brian. Bryan Spillane : So first just a housekeeping question. In terms of Prisoner, are you going to finance that with debt, with the revolver or just how are you financing that? David Klein : Yes, that's a hard one because of the fungibility of cash. We will not be going to the market to borrow for - specifically for The Prisoner. We will take it off the revolver or cash on hand. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And in terms of the accretion estimate that you gave, does that assume that you're just going to use cash in hand? David Klein : The accretion estimate assumes kind of an average borrowing rate actually. So I guess you could imply the revolver from that when you're doing your math. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of just sort of the flow of beer shipments for fiscal '17, given how fast the business is growing and the capacity constraints that you have, are we going to see maybe a different order pattern this year, where wholesalers are just going to build more inventory early in the season, so that you take less - take some pressure off the peak? David Klein : I don't think you'll see anything different from previous years because we've had this pressure if you'll recall for the last couple of years. And we do a lot of work with our distributor partners to plan inventory levels so that we optimize our - the freshness of our beer, while making sure that we don't stock out at retail. So I don't think you'll see a dramatic shift from where we've been in the past. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then just one - just sneak one more in, just in terms of the Canadian partial IPO, had you considered or would you consider either just a tax free spin to shareholders and or an outright sale, like why a partial IPO versus maybe some of the other options that might also create value? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes, because call it a middle of the road approach, right. It gets us some and some, right. The Canadian business is a great business. It enables us to continue to have the Canadian business that they utilize it as distribution platform for our US brands. On the other hand, it will create more transparency into the performance of this business and therefore we think that it will be positive from a valuation perspective. And then of course there's the proceeds from the sale of a portion of the business, right, which as I said in my talk will enable us to continue to manage our debt levels appropriately and fits very nicely into our overall capital allocation strategy to enable us to do the things that David was just talking about, which includes some of our strategic initiatives, as well as David pointed out, methodically returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividend increases, as well as share repurchases. We did recommence our share repurchasing activity this quarter, and although we didn't include it in our guidance because we don't know what we're going to do necessarily because we act opportunistically there. It's certainly a major element of our capital allocation strategy, as I said to continue to return money to shareholders in both those matters, dividend increases and share repurchases. So it all fits together pretty nicely without sort of disassembling the business. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. Rob Sands : Morning, Vivien. David Klein : Hi, Vivien. Vivien Azer : Just wanted to follow up on Bryan's question first, please. In terms of your inventory levels on the beer side, I was a little bit surprised actually not to see inventories build back up given what happened in the third quarter. So where are we in terms of your inventory levels right now? David Klein : Our inventory levels from a days on hand, right, which reflect year-over-year growth, our inventory levels from a days on hand standpoint are consistent with where we've been in previous years at this point in time. And that's both within our network and at the distributors. Vivien Azer : And is that a level that you're comfortable with or would you like to see that come up a little bit, given the momentum of the business? David Klein : We're comfortable with that level. Vivien Azer : Okay, perfect. Thank you. My next question has to do with Ballast Point. Can you comment at all on how much capacity there is, in particular at Miramar? And I ask it because given the fast top line growth, while the business is dilutive today, I suspect a lot of that has to do with the fact it's much more expensive to ship west to east than vice versa. So how are you thinking longer term about incremental capacity and where would you put that? David Klein : So first of all I'll say that Miramar has capacity for about 10 million to 12 million cases. And then beyond that I think we've said in the past that, and Ballast Point has said this, Jim Buechler and his team have discussed looking for a location for an east coast brewery at some point in the future. Vivien Azer : Is there any rationale to accelerating those plans to capture better margin given shipping rates? Rob Sands : I would say - this is Rob. I would say that was being heavily investigated and pursued even prior to the acquisition. So the answer is that it is a strategic initiative as we speak. Vivien Azer : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much, good morning. A couple of questions. One, have you considered taking more pricing in beer given the capacity constraints and given the need to pull on the AB supply? Rob Sands : Look, our position on pricing, our strategy remains the same. We really make our pricing decisions from a very granular perspective market by market, case by case, city by city. I think fundamentally the answer to your question is that we don't necessarily see anything on the horizon that dictates that we should be taking a different approach to pricing than we have in the past. It's going to be sort of based on what we think the market will allow and our competitive position. And we wouldn't use pricing to slow down the business and potentially damage the health of the brands. I can tell you that right now. We have, we believe the capacity necessary to meet the demand in the marketplace. But pricing is an important element of our growth strategy too. So we're going to continue to take the very balanced approach that we've been taking in the past. Caroline Levy : Got it, okay. I know that you're looking to enforce some of your contracts a little more than you have in the past with distributors in terms of what kind of promotional spending they should do. And I'm wondering as you build up your 10% to 13% organic growth, how much is driven by expected better performance out of distributors? And sort of separate but the same, what growth rate are you looking for the Corona brand which had such an exceptional year last year, are you looking for high single digits still on Corona? Rob Sands : So in answer to your first question, I think there is a bit of a misnomer there. We clarified some points in our distributor contracts and this and that recently. We talked about that at our GNS, our Gold Network Summit. It's really - I would say doesn't amount to much. We're not - I wouldn't call it enforcing our contracts in a particularly different manner. We continue to have the same approach with our distributors, which is very much a partnership approach, okay. Our proposition to our distributors is pretty simple, okay, which is like any smart business people, you should invest in the higher margin, higher growth parts of your business that can develop, you know, that's going to drive your margins in your business for the future, and we think that it's our portfolio that's the squeaky wheel that ought to get that grease. I mean, it's really as simple as that. And by the way, it's not a hard sell, okay? They all get it. They get it very easily and they can see it in their own financial results that the key in many respects to their future from any material perspective is in our portfolio, because the other large elements of their portfolio are flat to down, okay. So all of the action is in our brands and to some degree craft of course, which is - we're playing in that as well. So I don't think that there's anything particularly different going on with our distributor network. We're not insisting upon different terms than we have in the past in any material sense. And then your other question was product growth? We don't really break that out, but needless to say we're getting very strong growth in Corona and we continue that growth - continue to expect that growth to continue, right, driven by the can, driven by continued execution in the marketplace, even for 100% or a really well distributed brand. There remains to be distribution opportunity even for a brand like Corona when you look at the various SKUs and packs and this and that that we have. I mean, it's not 100% distributed in that regard. And then look, we're increasing our marketing activities ahead of the market very consciously because the most critical thing we have is to maintain the health of these brands. And therefore we think that continuing to increase our share of voice in building these brands is important. And then we also have great execution in that regard. I think that our advertising and our marketing in general and our strategy there is really working. So I mean I suppose you could be increasing bad advertising, which isn't going to get you anywhere. But we're increasing really, really good advertising that resonates with the consumer and we know that we get a fantastic return from this, so - because we measure it. Caroline Levy : That's great, thank you very much. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal. Tim Ramey : Hi. Good morning, thanks. Rob Sands : Hi, Tim. Tim Ramey : Your cash tax rate continues to be really low, and there's some downward movement in the book tax rate. I assume that's all timing differences on cash or tax depreciation. But if we think about the short-term two to three years out, how will those two numbers trend if you have any insight into that or does book move towards cash or does cash move towards book, I assume? David Klein : Yes, so Tim, I think one of the issues that we wrestle with and you wrestle with and every corporation in America is wrestling with at the moment is all of the change that's happening both domestically and internationally from a tax policy perspective. And so you can see the benefits that we've had in recent years from certain foreign tax credits, as well as from the benefits of the tax treatment of stock option expense. And so that has helped push our number down in recent years, right. And then in terms of our cash versus book, I would say how that all resolves itself on an ongoing basis, I think is going to depend upon the changes in overall tax policy. I would say that we expect our cash taxes to remain in the low 20%s for the foreseeable future. Tim Ramey : Okay. And just one other one on CapEx. I'm assuming that 2017 is the peak CapEx year, but it's not super clear what '18 should look like, and that's at least in the forecast horizon now, I assume it's lower than '17. Can you give any clarity on that? David Klein : Yes, a little bit I would say that '17 and '18 as we said will continue to be the peak years. It's hard to really say at this point how things will flow between say '18 and '19 versus '17. So other than '17 and '18 will be our heaviest year, I'm reluctant to give any further guidance. Tim Ramey : Terrific. Thanks for your help. David Klein : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. A couple of questions. One, could you review for us your overall M&A strategy as it pertains between beer, spirits, and wine, and is it primarily opportunistic? Obviously there are strategic elements in terms of mix, but also is there any sense given that you are really the only total beverage alcohol play company in the US. Longer term would you be looking for a more equal mix in terms of the businesses between beer, wine, and spirits? Rob Sands : Well, I think that the answer to your question is again, kind of some and some. It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that you know, clearly premiumization is an important part of the strategy whether it's wine, beer, or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the three segments, which goes back of course to the premiumization element of the strategy. And also obviously buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You know, you look at wine, and clearly all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. You look at beer, it's almost the same in that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's like at the highest end of the beer market and it\u2019s got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And then spirits is an interesting segment as well, and we made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months. One called the Crafthouse Cocktails where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be a very fast growing, high margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently again, that we think has the potential to be high margin, high growth too. But spirits I'd say is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that's somewhat under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon, but it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits much like craft beers is pretty interesting, but much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer, and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I'd just add one other thing; our strategy is as it relates to capital allocation, acquisitions, really hasn't changed, okay. We're not on an acquisition bender or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about where we've taken advantage of opportunities. It's about buying sort of tuck-in, high growth, high margin, easy to assimilate type opportunities. So I guess as I said, the answer to your question is some and some. It's strategic, but it's also opportunistic. As we go forward here we intend to maintain, more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all of the things that we've said being a priority : reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along, and maintaining our debt levels sort of in that three range where we said. Rob Ottenstein : That's great. And just in terms of the targeted leverage ratio, I think you've said 3.5 to 4, given the outlook in terms of CapEx spending, as well as your very strong cash flows, how for the right acquisition would you be willing to go much over four times in the next year or so? Rob Sands : We don't have any plans in that regard. Rob Ottenstein : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. Rob Sands : Hi, Bonnie. Hi. I just have a question on or a follow on question on beer pricing. Clearly your net beer pricing was strong in Q4, and I guess I was hoping you could drill down between how much was from rate versus brand mix versus channel mix? And then assuming you saw positive channel mix, how much of that was driven by greater distribution in the high margin C-store channel? David Klein : Yes, Bonnie, most of the pricing benefits that we've seen are really just overall price across the portfolio, across markets. And we would have expected it to be fairly heavy in the previous quarter because of the price increase that we implemented in October of this past year. Bonnie Herzog : And then are you seeing increased penetration of the C-store channel, I know that's been a focus of yours as an opportunity. David Klein : Yes, we continued to improve in that category. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then maybe one final quick question on your Tail [ph] brands. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of how some of the Tail beer brands performed last year and then how meaningful you think these can become to your overall portfolio in the next couple of years? Thanks. David Klein : Yes, we think that we will see growth in the mid to high single digits. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Mark Swartzberg : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Rob Sands : Hi, Mark. Mark Swartzberg : I guess, two topics; one beer, one Canada partial IPO one. On beer, David, really nice progression with the gross margin over the course of fiscal '16, about 300 bps up and then - on an annual basis, and then in the fourth quarter we saw it about 380 bps up. So I'm wondering if there's anything unusual in that progression and the progression which improved as the year progressed, as we think about how to balance the gross margin in our fiscal '17 estimates and the level of SG&A increases. And then kind of hand in hand with that, we saw like a 40% increase in SG&A in the quarter, $35 million. Can you give us some sense of what was in that $35 million number? David Klein : Yes, so from a margin standpoint, the fourth quarter was really impacted primarily by price and mix. And I guess we would have again expected that because fourth quarter being when we implement our price increases, we would have benefited from the favorable FX and commodities environment, which we benefited from throughout the course of the year, but there was strong tail wind from that in Q4 as well. And your other question, Mark? Mark Swartzberg : Was the - that benefit you just described in the fourth quarter was in a sense eaten up by a relatively large increase in SG&A, $35 million, 40% increase. Can you just speak to what was in that $35 million number? David Klein : So in terms of total SG&A, we would be - we saw increases in marketing. We saw increases in compensation expense. We had some increases that would have come into our number on a year-over-year basis as a result of the Ballast Point acquisition. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. Okay, great. And then with the Canada partial IPO, I mean kind of the elephant in the room of course is partial and IPO and Canada being this continent called North America like, is this the beginning of something larger, and I realize you're not going to say oh yes, we intend to IPO our larger wine and spirits business eventually. But is it unreasonable to think that this creates optionality for you, should you decide to ever go down that road? And then hand in hand with that, because it is obviously a leading question, it seems to me that all the merits that you're offering for Canada in terms of how it's performing and so forth, are merits that you could offer for your US business even to a greater degree. So just help me with kind of what's wrong with that thinking or what's right about that thinking? Rob Sands : Yes, I think that what's right about - we'll start with what's right about it, okay. Just to be nice. I think what's right about it is yes, this kind of thing does provide a greater degree of optionality for us of which it's precisely that, optionality. We don't - other than what we currently have planned, we don't necessarily - we're not planning anything else, but clearly it gives us more optionality. As it relates to the rest of the business, I think that you really can't draw any implications from that. We kind of look around the business and we see what we think are the opportunities, and again, this fits into our whole capital allocation strategy, right, managing debt, being able to return money to shareholders through dividends, stock repurchases, as well as being able to make some strategic acquisitions from time to time. So we're just trying to be prudent in a number of - I'd say we're trying to be transparent, we're trying to show where we think that there's value that isn't necessarily recognized, and then we're also trying to be prudent in our - I'll say, use of capital and where that capital comes from. Does that make sense? Mark Swartzberg : Great. Yes, it makes a ton of sense and really, I don't think anyone was looking for a Canada IPO, so kind of it's impressive to see you guys kind of offering that optionality. So thank you, Rob. Rob Sands : Well, appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Actually this is Stephanie on for Bill. I just have a quick question, and I apologize if I missed it. Did you give what's the sales base for the Prisoner acquisition was? David Klein : No, we didn't other than to say the Prisoner brands themselves in aggregate represent about 175,000 cases. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then maybe you could kind of give a little bit of an update on the Meiomi acquisition that you did and how it\u2019s tracking along with your plans, and any opportunities you may have with that going forward? David Klein : I would say from my perspective Meiomi continues to track actually better than our original expectations when we did the acquisition. The most recent 12 weeks or at least the 12 weeks in IRI that coincided with the end of our fiscal year had it up, the brand up 88%. And as we said when we originally spoke about the transaction, it has one of the best gross profit margin profiles within our entire wine portfolio, and we've continued to see that and in fact improved upon that a little bit. So we're very pleased with how we've progressed with Meiomi. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just a follow up, so looking at Prisoner, they would have kind of like a similar margin profile, kind of higher than the corporate average, but not so high as Meiomi, is that the right way to look at it? David Klein : That's the right way to look at it. It probably does come - actually line up fairly well with Meiomi. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Got it. Well, thanks so much for the color. Rob Sands : Sure. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan. Peter Graham : Hi, this is Peter Graham on for John. Just one quick question from me. As you guys build up and acquire more wine assets are you going to need to add more capacity similar to what you guys did on the beer side? Thanks. David Klein : We wouldn't expect to. Our intention for the business is to continue to milk the low end of the portfolio and to drive growth and increase profitability at the high end of the portfolio. So we will continue to have that consistent capital requirement in our wine business that we've seen over the past several years, but we just - our intent is to make it work harder. Peter Graham : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay, well thank you, everyone. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and FY16 results, I want to reiterate how pleased I am with our year end success and how we are positioned for continued growth and financial strength in fiscal '17. As our guidance shows, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving growth and we are firm in our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter of our new fiscal year. But before then we hope you'll pick up a few of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day weekend. And speaking of Cinco, you can look for us at the New York Stock Exchange on May 5th as we officially kick off our Cinco Happy Hour by ringing the closing bell. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands' fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the Company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the Company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during the Q&A session today to two questions per person. This has been our practice for the last several quarters and helps us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance and now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you Patty and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we\u2019re seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best in class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the US beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio lead volume gains amongst US brewers contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages. Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained two of the hottest brands in the US beer industry and held category leading positions as the number three and number two players respectively among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand and can format including the brand's first ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish, and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continued to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest growing brands in the category. Our new Pacifico 24 ounce can format is the number one new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter. And last but certainly not least, let\u2019s not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the US posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make the brand available in all 50 states. And to-date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar yearend. This distribution push along with successful new flavor and style launches is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point Brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers. I\u2019d now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment, and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we\u2019ve seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year over year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth-quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we\u2019re cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the can format for this brand. Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates that consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth in health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity including packaging, utilities, warehouse, and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. In addition, we've officially broken ground at Mexicali and although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expected it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for a wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands Meiomi and The Prisoner which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30% respectively. Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment extending the lead in our number one luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked number three in super luxury wine at the greater than $25 retail price point. The US wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share driven by our core focus brands where we are building momentum across multiple price segments. Let me provide a few examples, in the IRI $20 plus luxury and super luxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest Pinot Noir but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI super premium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the number one chardonnay in the IRI premium segment, and Black Box is the leader in the fast growing premium box segment. In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction thanks to new margin enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Ros\u00e9 and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon. The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter posting mid-single digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic line segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins. So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our focused brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development have several new products in the hopper a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grape costs. We are capitalizing on the market leading growth of our margin enhancing wine acquisitions Meiomi and The Prisoner and we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business.  Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on two more high-level topics of interest for our business. So first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the UK exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a US business. Our sales outside the US represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets in particular is limited and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially. In closing, our first-quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our first-quarter financial results. David Klein : Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. On the last call we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid teens EPS growth. I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019re steadily executing against our plans. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22% putting us on a path to achieve our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share. Let's look at Q1 fiscal \u201817 performance in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15% primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%; this includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal \u201816 into Q1 fiscal \u201817 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal \u201817 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%; this primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment driven by solid financial results for the organic US wine business in the quarter. Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%, this reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online, SG&A investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margins for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly. I\u2019d also like to note we've reduced the level of product we received under the interim supply agreement with ADI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. the increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal \u201816. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of Q1 fiscal \u201817 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal \u201816. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal \u201817 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal \u201817 effective tax rate to approximate 29%.  Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full-year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remain unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal \u201817 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined. Moving to our full year fiscal \u201917 P&L outlook, we continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid-to-high single digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low-to-mid single digit range with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits. In closing we are off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal \u201817. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we are excited that we achieve the critical milestone by reaching the $20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava. With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Market. Nik Modi : Just a quick question on the wine business. The depletion growth looked pretty good on the organic side, and I know you talked about a lot of brands growing, but what exactly is underpinning some of the improvement there. Maybe you can share some of the early things that Bill Newlands is doing in that business. And then just a quick follow-up, just wanted to get an update on how the Kim Crawford test is doing out in Texas, I believe you guys are spending some marketing dollars behind that brand, and just wanted to get kind of an update on that? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes so, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's really a subset of our Focus Brand that are driving that depletion growth that is excluding our newly acquired brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, but we've got a few brands right now that are really on fire like Black Box, Clos du Bois is up heavy double-digits. Kim Crawford is up very significantly and even our largest brand which is Robert Mondavi, the Woodbridge brand is up very significantly on a very large base. The Mark West brand, the Pinot Noir brand that we acquired a few years ago is also up very sharply. So, I guess that we are - it\u2019s fortunate that we can report that our brand portfolio includes some really hot brands at the moment. What was your question about Texas, Nik? Nik Modi : Just the Kim Crawford tests, just looking at how that's progressing. Rob Sands : That test has gone extremely well, I think that the test has demonstrated that the brand responds and performs very well to advertising. And consequently, we will be increasing our advertising for this brand. And the test was basically - the test basically demonstrates that\u2019s an investment that will more than pay back, so we're pretty excited about that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : You mentioned the FX impact, and I think of all the things that you buy from other places in the world not just beer, but barrels and so on. We've had some pretty substantial moves particularly against the peso, I wonder if you could kind of give us any quantification about what that contribution might look like now? David Klein : Yes, so Tim, as it relates specifically to the peso, about 20% of our COGS for beer are denominated in peso. And so, clearly as the dollar strengthens, we get a benefit, what I\u2019ll say though is that we also as we sit here today we are about 70% to 75% hedged on our exposures against all currencies for the remainder of the fiscal year. So, the strengthening dollar clearly benefits us, but some of that benefit is muted by the hedges that we have in place. Tim Ramey : Okay, and Rob maybe you're always good at commentating on the kind of the big picture in wine, I think the category is performing well and you\u2019re outperforming the category. How do you see that performing for maybe the 12 to 18 months time horizon? Rob Sands : I thing actually the category as you mentioned has accelerated about lately and therefore I would say that it's very robust. I would say that trading of at premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay and things have really kind of shifted, maybe two or three years ago we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 to $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments hence are interested in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner and that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor the premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we\u2019re constantly working on positioning our portfolio, okay to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we\u2019ve very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories, and it's not just price segments, right, it\u2019s categories. Perfect example being Pinot Noir, okay, we are a leader in Pinot Noir today and Pinot Noir is just an extremely hot varietal, and I would say that the good news there is that I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for, you know, well into the future in that, it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting in there of course Pinot Noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we - and as I said we get the hottest brand, red blends continue to be hot as you know we've got hot brands in the red blend category, I mean, Prisoner I mean is a perfect example of that albeit a newly acquired brand but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. And again, I don't think that's particularly trendy and that it\u2019s gotten fantastic scores and it\u2019s considered to be, you know, let me put it this way, a real fine wine, so this is basically the answer to your question, Tim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : So, first of all in terms of the beer depletion, Rob as you pointed out pretty choppy weather and some other factors in the first quarter. So when you looked at your 9% depletion for the core organic, you can kind of have a sense of how much some of these one-off factors dampened that growth. And then I think you said June depletions are progressing. Can you give us a little bit more color just in terms of what you're seeing in June, I mean some of the Nielsen data actually looked pretty strong as we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks? So maybe just a little bit more color just on the June trend. And then as it relates to your full year depletion growth, it seems like you\u2019re kind of still expecting relatively healthy organic sales growth for your core business, any sort of turnaround on the competitive environment as you think about the marketplace? Thanks. Rob Sands : So, look it's hard to get into specific numbers, okay on what the growth would have been had these factors not affected us. But as I said, there were two or three factors, I\u2019d say, first quarter was kind of not a great quarter for the beer business, the beer category in general. I mean that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about, the Recall affected it for sure, hence we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The overlap in the intro [ph] was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So, we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio and that's our import portfolio, right. Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that one can even say. It's the fastest growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire US on what's getting to be a very big base, okay. I mean, we can't even talk about double-digit growth because it's so high. It's triple digit sometimes. Judy Hong : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, David, just in terms of the phasing of, I guess, the beer gross margin progression for the balance of the year, as we think about certainly Nava, having now the 20 million hectoliter capacity, I think you have one more furnace in Nava up and running as well, but obviously some of the startup costs on the Nava side, so just, can you just help us understand sort of the phasing of gross margin. Is second quarter kind of more negatively impacted as it's more of a heavy volume quarter or how we should think about the phasing? David Klein : Yes. So in the first quarter, we benefited from pricing in general, which somewhat offset COGS increases which were driven by increased depreciation. We did receive some benefits from FX, but probably the biggest driver in the quarter was the timing of marketing spend and now, I'm talking about operating margins, right, so we'll see that spend come back as we progress in the fiscal year, which will have a bit of a dampening effect on the margin. So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion in getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters. The other comment I want to make Judy relates to glass. So, yes, we've fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July and then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect our acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So, I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year, if it shows up this year at all. Judy Hong : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohseniun of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohseniun : Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could review for us your cash flow priorities in terms of M&A versus returning cash to shareholders, given some of the rumors in the press lately and is M&A a big focus at this point, and what range or size of deal are you generally comfortable with from an M&A standpoint? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes. So I would say that our capital priorities haven't changed at all. They sort of remain number one at keeping our debt levels in that sort of mid-3 to 4 range, where we actually are at the current time. Returning dollars to shareholders continues to be a big and important focus for us. As you know, we did increase our annual dividend at the end of the year and we have made some stock repurchases. So, we continued to prioritize that as a key priority. And then, as we've said in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in type acquisitions of the things that we would look at and I would say that that strategy is working very well. And then I think to your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3 to 4 times, okay, we will be, I would say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority and then, as I mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right, but that's a disposition. So if we were to complete that, that will actually bring in cash, right. So we are being, I would say, pretty judicious in terms of how we\u2019re managing the whole capital allocation process and our priorities. So I think that we've got, we\u2019ve struck a really good balanced there, let me put it that way. Dara Mohseniun : Okay, that's helpful. And then beer pricing was strong in the quarter at 3%, obviously part of that is balanced mix, but still strong on an underlying basis at a time when industry discounting looks like it\u2019s picked up. So I was just hoping you could review if you are comfortable on the 2% pricing range going forward for your business and anything you\u2019re seeing from a competitive standpoint in the industry? Rob Sands : Yes. Our position on pricing and our plans haven't changed at all, and we don't really -- yes, there has been some competitive activity, but I would say that there is really nothing indicative that from a competitive point of view that that's really changed very significantly. I don't think anybody is like falling off a log and changed their general modus operandi in the industry general, that\u2019s sort of our view of things. Dara Mohseniun : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter. So two questions. One, if you look at, and I know it's tough to get to, so just I appreciate any kind of way to think about our estimates. So if you look at roughly 9% depletion growth on the Mexican brands, can you break out roughly what percentage of that is coming from Mexican American consumers and what percent will be coming out from the general market? David Klein : So Robert, the way we think about it when we look at our FY17 numbers, we think that's about 40% of our year-over-year growth will come from increasing distribution in the business. So this doesn't get to the demographics, but this is how we think about our numbers. So about 40% coming from growing distribution, about 10% coming from pack innovation during the fiscal year and then the remainder is really driven by demographic shifts like Hispanic and millennial consumers, but we also have included in that remaining 50%, other environmental factors. So it gets a little bit money, but when we\u2019re putting our plans together, that's how we think about it. Robert Ottenstein : Well, in terms of the 40%, would it be fair to say that most of that 40% would be the general market because presumably Modelo Especial is pretty well distributed in Mexican-American accounts? David Klein : Yes. Some of the distribution growth though isn't necessarily just getting APAC into individual stores. It's getting different pack sizes into individual stores, which will take place across all of the retail establishments. Robert Ottenstein : Got it. And then my second question, Rob, as you look out at the -- on the environment or the opportunity set for potential wine acquisitions and the possible targets, how does that look today and how does that compare with what you may have seen a few years ago? Is it more target rich environment, less, are you excited about what's out there in terms of what you can bring in to the portfolio and just kind of give us a sense of what the landscape looks like? Rob Sands : Yes. I don't think that we see anything that\u2019s largely different than what has been the case over the last several years, especially for perhaps the kind of things that we might be interested in. It really remains a one-off kind of opportunistic situation. There has been sort of a lot of activity in sort of the smaller end of the market, which meaning small deals that we don't really plan because they wouldn't be particularly significant or material to us. But of the kind of brands that we might be interested in, I would say that there is no fundamental change in the activity in that arena. Robert Ottenstein : So I mean perhaps another way of asking is just kind of for modeling purposes or just thinking about it, should we think about maybe one deal a year, averaging out to that obviously it\u2019s opportunistic? Rob Sands : It\u2019s totally unpredictable. Robert Ottenstein : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. So two questions on Ballast please. On the depletion growth that you guys noted, would it be possible to unpack that and give us a sense for how much distribution added to that? David Klein : We've grown distribution about 40% since the time we took on Ballast Point, I think we\u2019re at about 20 ACV and it's -- however, we\u2019re still seeing growth in our existing markets in our existing stores. So I would say we\u2019re seeing growth in big markets like California as well as growing incremental markets across the US. Vivien Azer : That's great. And as you target the full national distribution by the end of the calendar year, how would you anticipate your ACV tracking with that? David Klein : Yes. I think coming back to the growth that we've seen so far, I would just expect that we will continue to drive ACV, as that brand becomes one of the biggest craft brands in the marketplace. We will continue to see more retailer uptake and more consumer demand for the product. In terms of quantifying what happened with the ACV, I don't have that at hand. Vivien Azer : Okay, that's great. And then my second question also Ballast related please, I know it's a little bit of a ways out, but as you think about the construction of the Virginia Brewery, can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the margin opportunity there? Rob Sands : Yes. Well, again, one of the reasons we really like this brand and we've said this since we first announced the purchase is that this brand has very healthy operating margins as we sit here today. It's a little dilutive to our overall beer business, but we would expect over time as the brand gains a little scale and we get some benefits of East Coast production in the Virginia facility, we would expect that that margins begin to close the gap with our import portfolio margins. Vivien Azer : Terrific. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning and again congrats on a great quarter. My question is on, I wonder if you could get specific, David on A&M as a percent of sales for beer in the quarter, and if you still see it at sort of 8.5 to 9 for the year? David Klein : Yes. 8.5% to 9% and that's across our entire beer business, although most of the spend at this point, as you know, is focused on the import portfolio. On that point, Caroline, I will say that, we've begun advertising on a brand like Pacifico on a broader scale than we have in the past and as a result, we saw very healthy depletion growth on Pacifico of around 17% in the quarter. Caroline Levy : And in the quarter, what was A&M as a percentage of revenue because you said there are some timing differences, so it sounds like it will spike in the second quarter? David Klein : Yes. So in the quarter, yeah, I don't have that number. We can get back to you with the specific number for the quarter. Caroline Levy : Okay. And it would also be helpful and I don't want to really give this, but D&A didn\u2019t seem to go up that much first quarter over fourth quarter, but you have called it out as a margin pressure for beer going forward, as you bring on now the capacity, so, like, would you be able to tell us what D&A was for the beer business in the quarter? David Klein : Yes. We\u2019re going to file the Q today and that information will be in the 10-Q when it\u2019s filed. Caroline Levy : Okay, thanks. Just finally on the timing of advertising, does this suggest that you have more programs coming up than usual in the second quarter, which could be helpful to sales? Caroline Levy : Yes. And again I think you have to think about it in the context, I know you are asking the question and I'm not answering actually, but you have to think about it in the context of a percentage, because on an absolute dollar basis, I'm not suggesting that we've spent less in the first quarter. It's just less as a percentage of the business. So, we still executed our normal marketing programs in the first quarter of the year, but yes, we do have that activity ramping up in 2Q and then going into the fall support season. Caroline Levy : Okay. Thanks a lot, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks, good morning. Couple of questions, one, Rob, you had talked about only 50% of your business is tracked by IRI, which -- are you seeing any meaningful changes or growth rates or anything in the non-tracked channels or should we not be looking at IRI as closely? Rob Sands : I think the IRI is fairly reflective of our business, but remember that the IRI was not being reflective of the on-premise, which constitutes about 15% or so of the business and it also is not reflective of what goes on in wine and spirits and control subs, so the biggest chunk there is probably on-premise, which in our business is running up about mid-single digits in the beer business and our beer business at low single-digits in our wine business and from a market perspective, is down in both categories, in all categories. Wine, spirits and beer, on premise was down as a category or as a market segment for the category for the quarter. So that's probably one of the biggest callouts is on premise not being reflective, not being reflected by IRI. Bill Chappell : Yes. That helps. And then second, just to follow up on Ballast Point now, as the distribution has expanded, can you kind of tell us what your learnings for a product that\u2019s at the high-end of the price range that was largely a West Coast regional brand, I mean how has it resonated versus kind of expectations as you moved it more and more to the east and with the price points kind of compared to other things on the shelf? Rob Sands : Well, I think it's resonated really well. I mean, where we have gotten new distribution as we moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets and as we grow the new markets, I think that it\u2019s really more viewed as a really high-end, high quality, award winning brand and it\u2019s all about sort of style and flavors, and I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that, it does have a lot of different styles like [indiscernible] or the Sculpin IPA and then it\u2019s got flavors and has like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot or a new product, which we just intro-ed called Varmint, which is a honey flavored pale ale, but this is very subtle stuff, right. It's not like it\u2019s flavored like a flavored fab, okay, like [indiscernible] these are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, these sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops and therefore it\u2019s, I\u2019d say real beer and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super-high quality, award winning product, a lot like wine in that regard, right, high-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as super high quality examples of that type of product. So it\u2019s much more like that, much more like high end wine is the way I would think about Ballast Point. Bill Chappell : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Two questions, one on Modelo Especial, Rob, if we could perhaps go a little bit deeper there, its growth stronger than Corona Extra, I'm sure that was true again in the quarter, I didn't catch the depletion rate, could you just give us a flavor for not only what the depletion rate for the brand was in the quarter, but what your plans are to perhaps accelerate the rate of depletion growth for that brand specifically. I'm interested in ACV intentions, spend rate, trying to get a better sense of where we are with that success story? Rob Sands : Yes. So Modelo Especial depletion growth rate first quarter about 20% and we've got big plans to, say, accelerate that growth rate or at least maintain it, but -- and as you pointed out, it's all about distribution, I mean Modelo Especial is growing and it\u2019s the size that it is without being in full distribution, okay, compared to other major brands of its size, it\u2019s one of the top beer brands now in the entire country and if you look at beer brands that have full distribution, I mean, you\u2019re talking like 80%, 90%, okay. Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway and I think that the thing that you should realize is in general, okay, it\u2019s distribution growth that drives depletion growth probably the most of anything. So pretty big runway there. It's a good news that probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution and if you look at our portfolio in general, whether it\u2019s wine, beer, spirits, Modelo Especial or fast-growing brands, are achieving their growth through both velocity growth as well as distribution growth. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. And what I\u2019m hoping to better understand is, this summer or the next few quarters, is there the intent to pick up the pace of ACV gains for that brand versus what they\u2019ve been, given what you just said or because the other choice of course is to say, Corona Extra is the horse here? Rob Sands : ACV growth has been and will continue to be a number one priority for the beer business and Modelo Especial in particular, when you say pick up, it's not like we wrapped at a particular point in time on distribution growth, it\u2019s what, that is what the sales organization basically is all about and does, okay. When companies like ourselves talk about execution or sales execution, they\u2019re talking about growing distribution first and foremost and then probably the number to think in sales organization execution is all about merchandising and add activity at retail. So that's what sales forces do. That\u2019s all they do, they run out and get distribution. They grow distribution and they work with the distributors and the retailers to maximize the merchandising opportunities. Mark Swartzberg : Got it. Okay. And my second question, I\u2019ll stay on that brand, media spend for Modelo Especial rate of growth, can you give us a sense, we heard about the portfolio rate of growth picking up here over the next few quarters, is it fair to think that that particular brand is getting an outsized rate of increase versus Corona Extra and some other brands or is that not the right way to think about it? David Klein : We don't really break down the spend between the brands publicly, but I would say that we know that last year, we started to spend more in terms of general market advertising as it relates to Modelo Especial, you\u2019ll continue to see that ramp up for the remainder of this year. Rob Sands : And I\u2019d also point out that, and I think this was mentioned previously, I mean we have put some media advertising in place for Pacifico and Pacifico is absolutely on fire with 17% depletion growth in the first quarter and I would say there is a lot of chatter beginning -- we are beginning to hear a lot of chatter about that particular brand and its general -- and its appeal in particular to craft drinkers. It seems to be a brand that when craft drinkers aren\u2019t drinking, I would say traditional craft, okay, it\u2019s sort of their next go to session item, seems to be Pacifico and we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest an growth in that particular product and that 24-hours can has been on fire. So I would say that is something you should watch as the next up and comer. Mark Swartzberg : That's, great. Okay. Excellent. Thank you, Rob. Thanks, David. Operator : And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining our call today. As we wrap up our discussion, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the overall excellent performance of our business this quarter. Our fiscal \u201817 is off to a fantastic start and we\u2019re confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance. As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, I hope you remember to bring some of our fine products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them of course responsibly. Hopefully, you received the save the date notice for our planned New York City Investor Meeting on November 9. At that time, we look forward to speaking with you about the future strategy for our business. Thanks and have a great July 4th holiday. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At the time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive, and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectation, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each Q&A session participants to two questions. That will help us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob. Robert Sands : Thanks, Patty. And good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s second Quarter Fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today, reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 Million. Now, this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sells approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last three years. The portfolio includes four core products \u2013 American Prairie Bourbon, Double Rye!, Rendezvous Rye and High West Whiskey Campfire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. Now, let\u2019s turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business which is significantly outperforming the US beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation\u2019s beers contributed 60% of the total US beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands. And we remain the number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the US beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our 120 days of summer marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the Fourth of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the number three and the number two overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains from increased marketing investments and consumer demand. Corona Extra continued to air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV, while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited edition boxing bottles at the end of August. In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams as the exclusive import beer sponsor and official Cerveza of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end market. During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective cross-promotion and awareness building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the number two imported beer in the US and directly links it to the leadership of its sister Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the number one dark Mexican beer while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. With its entire portfolio under one roof, consumers will begin to see a new fall advertising campaign, unified packaging including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale at retail inspired by Modelo\u2019s heritage, tradition and high quality standard. Now, during the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. I\u2019d also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24-ounce single serve can continues to gain traction as the number one new item nationally in IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. And let\u2019s not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the US and achieved solid high-double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continued to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the US and recently began the build out of a Ballast Point East Cost brewery in Virginia. Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering products supply to support our sales growth during our peak sales period. As you are aware, we've been transitioning directly from our recently completed 20 million hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second blast furnace of the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days, we're producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an approved efficiency rate. And finally, construction at our new brewery at Mexicali is picking up momentum, including infrastructure investments to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains. For our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35% respectively. These premium margin-accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the 5th consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90 plus points. Our higher-margin-focused brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black Box, Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree, and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as blue-chip brands by Impact Databank as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our focus brands, which continued to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin-enhancing offerings like Cooper & Thief, a Bourbon Barrel-Aged red blend at the super luxury price point, as well as the Callie collection priced in the super-premium price segment. We're also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet and Ravage Cabernet, both of which are exceeding their goals so far this year. As we head into the key holiday season, selling season for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our focus brands. As is typical of this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The crop is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location, and demand. So, in closing, we're at the halfway point of the year and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results, while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year. And I'm pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands. And we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results. David Klein : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we\u2019re pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal 2017. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal 2017. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. Looking at our Q2 fiscal 2017 performance in more detail where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results, you can see organic beer net sales increase 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. Our US depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our US shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal 2017. This is mostly timing related as we expect US shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix, and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 million, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest line of our income statement. At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that, at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7.25% senior notes that were coming due in September 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal 2016. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4 times at the end of Q2 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal 2016. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full-year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. Last year\u2019s rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal 2017 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. Now, let\u2019s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx. For first half of fiscal 17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior-year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava brewery capital payments into next year. Primarily as a result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by a $125 million to a range of $1.125 to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal 2017 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. Moving to our full year fiscal 2017 P&L outlook, I said earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17%, with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represent the high-end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated and some additional foreign-currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million dollars for fiscal 2017, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal 2017. I would also note, before closing, that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal 17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions us to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and its portfolio of award-winning high-end craft whiskeys will provide us excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favored products in an exciting category. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just two quick questions for me. On premise, Rob, maybe you can give us some context on kind of state of the union on premise generally? And then the second question is just when you think about the overall portfolio, obviously, you have a beverage alcohol play here across all the segments. And when you think about the beer industry and a lot of areas that you're actually not competing in today, some of the new areas like cider or spiked seltzer what have you, can you just give us your thought process on how you think about some of those verticals as white space over the coming years? Thanks. Robert Sands : Sure. First of all, as relates to the on premise, right, I would say that the condition of the on premise remains fairly poor, in that to the extent that it\u2019s measurable, the on premise I think continues to be sort of on the down-ish \u2013 slightly down-ish side. For us, our on premise business is very strong. So we\u2019re clearly gaining share in on premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our performance in the on premise. Then to your second question, Nik, there\u2019s definitely whitespace that we think is very good whitespace that we don't participate in. You mentioned, for instance, the FMB category. That\u2019s a very good category in terms of its premium positioning margins and growth, so that's clearly a subcategory that we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space. A good example of our filling whitespace in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right? That has put us in the craft brown spirits, right \u2013 American straight whiskey category and that is a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrant there and we\u2019ll be continuing to look at other areas of whitespace that would be available to us and makes sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because, obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer, and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we\u2019re really in a position to attack anything that meets our criterion in the wine, spirits, and beer business, which is pretty simple, right? High growth and high margin are really the two things that are critical to us. Nik Modi : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Robert Sands : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : Thanks. Hi, good morning. So, first, I guess, on High West, I just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about your ability to really scale up the brand, kind of similar to what you've done with wine acquisitions like Meiomi and Prisoner just in terms of supply, if you can also give us some color on what the supply situation looks like on High West, that would be great. And then just more broadly, as you think about your spirits portfolio, what is sort of your latest thinking in terms of the scale that you would need to really compete effectively in kind of the high-end spirits segment? Robert Sands : So to your first question, High West, the way to think about how we can scale that up is to look at examples like some of the ones that you pointed out, Meiomi, The Prisoner, growing \u2013 both of those growing super high single digits. I think Casa Noble is another great example, right, fastest growing luxury tequila \u2013 of any luxury tequila, growing in IRI at 45%. Basically, what we\u2019re able to do with these brands, and we will be able to do with High West, is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution and our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like a High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we\u2019ll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply these kind of high double-digit growth rates for the next several years and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand and the category. And then \u2013 what was the second question? Judy Hong : The supply situation, High West. Robert Sands : The supply situation, we don't see any issue there. Obviously, part of our due diligence was making sure that we had the supply to grow the brand. So we didn\u2019t wake up and fall off a log on that one. Obviously, we made sure that we would be able to supply the brand growth going forward. Judy Hong : Just in terms of your view on how much scale you think would be needed to compete effectively in the high-end spirit, do you think that you\u2019re kind of there and it's really more\u2026? Robert Sands : Yeah. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s really a relevant sort of measure. It\u2019s not competing in high-end spirits per se, right? It\u2019s really a brand by brand kind of thing. We\u2019re going to compete and out-compete the competition with the brands that we have. The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute materially to Constellation\u2019s growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second largest vodka in the entire United States and the number one import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand, I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that. So, I guess we don\u2019t really think about the \u2013 how do we compete effectively in a whole category. We think about what\u2019s the quality of the brands that we\u2019re buying and how can they contribute to Constellation\u2019s continued stellar growth in the top line and the bottom line. Brett Cooper : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Robert Sands : Hi, Mark. Mark Swartzberg : Hey, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. One on wine and spirits. You had about a $28 million SG&A increase. And, David, you touched on that, but could you give us a little bit more on what was going on there beyond the effect of just factoring in these new businesses? So that's one. And then number two on Nava, what's the capacity there right now and where are we in relation to getting to the 20 million by the end of this fiscal year? David Klein : So I'll start with the second question first, so in terms of 20 million hectoliters at Nava, we\u2019re producing 20 million hectoliters both from a brewing perspective and a packaging perspective. And, in fact, we\u2019re on our way to our next milestone of 25 million hectoliters. So I would say that the Nava expansion work is on track. We revised our capital spend primarily based upon outflows related to Nava for this fiscal year. That\u2019s just simply a timing thing as we manage our way through the build-out process and manage our cash flow. So then on the wine and spirits SG&A number, it really is just incremental spend in investment areas within our wine and spirits business, like marketing, innovation and having the right talent on board for our wine business. Mark Swartzberg : Okay. It\u2019s a little vague to me. Could you give a little more on that? Robert Sands : This is Rob. Look, the virtuous cycle. Our performance enables us to invest more in our businesses, in particular our wine and spirits business, which is now driving significant growth in that business and enabling us to both leverage the P&L and achieve market share growth as our focus brands are now growing at a rate that more than offsets the decline in our tail brands, which are in categories which are fundamentally not growing. So we\u2019re over-investing. And when I say over-investing, I mean we\u2019re investing more than we have traditionally, specifically in marketing of our wine and spirits brands. And so, what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We\u2019ve got tests going on in various states like Taxes, for instance, to really have a consumer way type advertising program like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brands, which by the way is driving the brand fantastically and I think that we\u2019re proving that our investments in media advertising, on wine, on brands by Kim Crawford and \u2013 Woodbridge is another one that we really have beat up our advertising on, that these are paying back at a rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally see in consumer products, which is very similar to our beer brands, in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products. So we\u2019re both testing what we can do through marketing and we\u2019re increasing marketing where we know that it already works. So, hopefully, [indiscernible]. Mark Swartzberg : It\u2019s helpful and encouraging. Robert Sands : It is encouraging. It\u2019s super encouraging as a matter of fact. David Klein : I would also want to point you, Mark, to \u2013 we still believe in, and it\u2019s implied in our guidance, that we\u2019re going to get leverage from net sales to EBIT in our wine and spirits business, despite a spending increase. Robert Sands : And share gains. Mark Swartzberg : That\u2019s great. It\u2019s helpful. And just plain encouraging. All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. Good morning. David, you mentioned that the tax rate would come in at 29%, I think, you said for the full year, which implies a pretty low rate for the 3Q and 4Q. Is there anything lumpy about the split between those quarters, so that we don't get our estimates too confounded here. David Klein : No, I think as is always with tax planning, I'm sure anything I say will be wrong, but I would suspect that the way we have our initiatives planned over the rest of the year, you can expect it will be roughly flat to bring you around to that \u2013 between the quarters to bring you to that 29% guidance. Tim Ramey : Got it, okay. And, Rob, as you pointed out quite rightly, your wine business has been pretty dramatically outperforming, but the category has been pretty good too. How would you describe the category outlook? Are we still in kind of an acceleration mode or just sort of growth is stable, but okay? Robert Sands : Well, I think the category is performing very well. I think that we\u2019ll continue to see sort of mid-single digit volume type growth in the category, right? And I think that we\u2019ll see the spread between volume and sales and, therefore, premiumization in trade, I think we\u2019ll continue to see that grow. I think we\u2019re a real shift, whereas five years ago we were sort of talking, what they used to call, the super-premium category, which was the $8 to $12 range, is really being the hot and premium segment of the industry. We\u2019re seeing a definitive shift up in that regard. And, now, you\u2019re sort of seeing this $15-$25 segment really coming on strong, as well as segments above that. So this is what is driving the wrong of brands like Meiomi, which are about $20 a bottle, or even Prisoner, closer to $40 a bottle, is this premiumization trend, which we think is going to continue unabated in certainly the mid-term. So I\u2019d say that the outlook for the category continues to be extremely positive. Tim Ramey : Just relative to the crop, generally, when we get a bigger crop, as it looks like we might this year, that does put some pressure on bulk line prices, which I would think might have good impacts on brands like Mark West, not right away, but perhaps for fiscal 2018, any thoughts on the state of bulk line and some of the brands that are sourced from bulk line? Robert Sands : Yeah. Look, a bigger crop is \u2013 definitely bodes well for lower prices. Supply, especially like you mentioned Mark West for pinot can be tight, so larger crop is going to be better all the way around. Could there still be a little price \u2013 a little cost inflation associated with it? Yeah. But we\u2019re \u2013 as typical, we just don't see cost inflation on the wine side of the business as being a big material factor in driving anything. We're expecting very normalized, pretty low cost inflation that we\u2019ll be able to pass on one way or another. So we don't see it impacting margins. And as I said, the bigger crop is a positive thing, yes. That will even help that. So it\u2019s a good thing. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. Congratulations. Robert Sands : [indiscernible] cost. Tim Ramey : Yep. Robert Sands : Sure, Tim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, David, if you could walk us through again the moving parts for margins in beers and also in wine in the back half because you did chart a lot of different things that were favorable in the first half and then some kind of spending. But it would be really helpful, the peso, the depreciation, all those things, if you could just run through that. David Klein : Yes. So as we said, the real change in our guidance was driven by a move in the peso and slower ramp-up of the depreciation charge into the business. Right? So that explains why we slid our guidance up a little bit. So that's the first bit. I would say, in the second half, we really would expect that gross margins would be flattish to the first half. We would expect that our marketing spend, which we say is between the 8.5% to 9% of net sales, that will be flattish in the second half. However, a big chunk of that will be spent in Q3 versus in Q4. So there\u2019ll be a little bit of volatility in that. And then when you get to the remainder of SG&A, if you think about as SG&A in a growing business, you start out and say, well, if you\u2019re not going to grow it at all, it\u2019s going to be straight line throughout the year. And in our business, SG&A is actually growing a little bit because the business is growing. And it's really that SG&A drag, which you\u2019re going to see affecting the beer margins in the second half. Caroline Levy : Is that depreciation? Is it a bit of a catchup versus the first half not being up? David Klein : Yeah. When we get into the second half, you start to have more depreciation come on line. You get a little bit more noise on line commissioning. You have less throughput at the plant. So there are a lot of puts and takes, I would say, in the second half. But as I said, I would still expect that our gross margins in beer will remain somewhat consistent. And then, our wine \u2013 for the most part, our wine expansion in the US has been driven by mix, and mix in the form of non-organic such as Meiomi and the Prisoner, but also mix within our base portfolio has improved as well or our organic portfolio has improved as well. In addition to that, we have had some benefits from freight savings in the US on wine. But I would say that we would expect wine margin trends to remain somewhat consistent in the second half, although as I called out in my script we can expect that since over the course of the year shipments will roughly equal depletions that will have a slowdown in the shipments line in the second half, even though consumer pull continues to be very strong and depletions will continue to be healthy. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed, but can you give us maybe some update on the Canadian wine business in terms of decisions to IPO versus for divestiture? And the reason I ask that is, I would've thought if we were in a process for sale that you would have maybe separated the revenue out as available-for-sale and not be part of the numbers. So I'm just trying to \u2013 any update and kind of thought process or where that process stands? David Klein : So I'll start out and then Rob can add some color. So where we are from an internal standpoint is we\u2019re still evaluating the IPO route and I would say that in the last quarter we finished our carve-out statements, which I will admit took longer than we had expected when we first started the process. And then beyond that, I would say that as we do with every decision the company has to make, we consider all of our alternatives, but as of this moment we\u2019re still doing the work to prepare for an IPO. Bill Chappell : Okay. Robert Sands : Yeah. I guess I would only add that as we have sort of gone down the IPO, right, the myriad of opportunities relative to the Canadian business are numerous. So we are in the process of evaluating all of the opportunities that are available to us and I would venture to say that we\u2019ll have something to say about all of that in the relatively near future when, I would say, our decisioning and the opportunities crystallize. So as I said, more to come on that in the relatively near future. All very positive, though. Bill Chappell : Good to hear. Good to hear. And a follow-up on the whiskey side, just kind of future plans of \u2013 whiskey can be segmented with a lot of brands, stand for a lot of different things, including I'm sure Old West. Do you look to add a variety of brands to build up the portfolio or do you really wanted to get behind Old West for the near-term? Robert Sands : We\u2019ll look at other brands as they become available. We\u2019re really kind of attacking, I'll say, whiskey from a couple of different perspectives, right? So number one, we bought High West in its entirety and, in essence, we\u2019ll be integrating that into the Constellation wine and spirits platform, albeit we will be keeping and utilizing the resources that High West already has, which is the one of the attractive things about that particular acquisition. And then, on the Ventures side of the business, we\u2019ve made an investment in \u2013 we\u2019ve made an investment in another Bourbon brand, the Greenbrier company which currently has released its Belle Meade brand of American straight whiskey, right, Bourbon and will be introducing other brands as they continue to distill and age the whiskey. So that was a minority investment on the Green Brier side. We think that\u2019s got some real attractiveness as well. So we\u2019re able to help them out more as a minority partner and on a consultation perspective. And then on the High West side, as I side, we\u2019ve taken full ownership of that and will be in essence integrating that into our wine and spirits platform. So we will continue to look at the category and look at it both through our Constellation Ventures lens as well as our normal sort of M&A lens. Bill Chappell : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and then congratulations on another terrific quarter. Robert Ottenstein : Thanks. Robert Ottenstein : So in terms of the High West, can you talk to us a little bit about the product\u2019s brand proposition, what makes the brand attractive, why you think it has a national appeal? And then separate \u2013 or related to that, just kind of the thinking about actually buying the brand and the business in total as opposed to having a distribution agreement, in which you distribute the product for them and take a nice payment for the ability to use your system as opposed to buying it straight out? Robert Sands : Yeah. So in terms of the brand and the proposition, we think that the brand, number one, has a great image. The proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon and rye had reached the level \u2013 craft bourbon and rye, in particular, reached the level of popularity that it has today. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category, that sort of a combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior, so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and bourbon and rye consumer and was able therefore to take advantage the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it\u2019s a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand and we think that we\u2019re going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate. Distribution agreements, we have no interest in whatsoever, okay? Number one, you don\u2019t own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term. Nobody is going to sign up and give you distribution rights for a life. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we\u2019re talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see distribution arrangements as an add-on for the future. As I said, way, way, way too low margin and no brand equity related there too. Robert Ottenstein : Terrific. Very clear. And then just on the beer side, could you please give us an update in terms of where things stand on various draft initiatives. There\u2019s a lot of talk about that a year ago and maybe where you are in terms of rolling out \u2013 I think it was mostly Corona Light in terms of how you\u2019re doing with tap handles penetration, what sort of growth and size of that business today versus a year or two ago? Robert Sands : Yeah. Draft is going to fantastically. The bottom line there, our total draft volume increased 30%, for example, in the second quarter. It\u2019s a significant contributor to our growth. Most of that growth was driven by Modelo Especial draft, for instance, was up almost 50% year-on-year and we're seeing these kind of positive trends across our whole draft portfolio. So draft, which was something that we almost didn\u2019t participate in at all, and nevertheless a significant segment of the beer industry, is another area that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re sort of infantile, but will contribute significant growth to the business going forward. So we're very excited about the draft proposition. We\u2019ve been running tests with Corona draft. Obviously, Corona Light draft is an area that is also providing growth to the company. So nothing, but up there. Robert Ottenstein : That\u2019s great. And just what percentage of your business now is draft and where do you think it could go? Robert Sands : It\u2019s small. And I think that it could start eventually to reflect the industry on amount. So, for us, it\u2019s less than 5% and for the industry I think it\u2019s closer to 15% to 20%, something like that. Robert Ottenstein : Thank you very much. Robert Sands : 10% to 15%. Robert Ottenstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. Robert Sands : Hi, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up a bit on wine pricing opportunities which you touched on. Clearly, you\u2019re driving a premiumization of your portfolio with your recent acquisition. But I guess \u2013 I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about potential pricing opportunities you have with some of your larger brands such as Mondavi which has generally seen price deflation over the last several years? David Klein : So we\u2019re beginning \u2013 we\u2019re maybe three years into a pricing journey in our wine business where we\u2019re trying to apply the same sort of pricing discipline that we apply to our beer business on a year-in and year-out basis. And I would say that, so far, wins have really been at the low end of the portfolio and at the luxury end of the portfolio. But we do believe that over time that we will continue to get pricing opportunities across the portfolio, right? So this will be the third year we\u2019ve taken price in various brands in our wine portfolio and this will be the year where we have the biggest effect of those price increases. But I would say that we\u2019re just beginning that journey. I would also say that we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re also seeing some ability to take price in certain segments of the wine category that haven\u2019t taken price in the past. So we remain cautiously optimistic, but we need to get some wins behind us before we want to talk about that much more. Robert Sands : I would just point out just a couple of interesting statistics which we track which is, if you look at IRI and year-to-date pricing for the top 20, we call premium SKUs, the percent change \u2013 now this is excluding Constellation, the top \u2013 the percent change versus a year ago is about 1.3%, okay? And then if you looked at year-to-date pricing for our top ten SKUs in the premium category, meaning Woodbridge and above, we\u2019re at plus 3.5%. So I think that the sort of journey that David was talking about is reflecting itself and working relatively well at the current time. Bonnie Herzog : Okay, that makes sense. And then just one final question on Corona cans. Could you just update us on the progress you\u2019ve made with your cans and then maybe touch on your penetration or ACV and consumer acceptance? David Klein : So we continue to see can grow. So as a percentage of Corona extra sales, they\u2019re still around 6%. But we saw \u2013 from a depletion standpoint, we saw high teens growth in cans for depletions in the quarter. So we continue to see increasing consumer uptake of the brand. And I would say that from an ACV perspective, our cans are not distributed anywhere near the level of kind of the total 80 ACV that brand Corona as distributed out. So we think there\u2019s still a lot more runway for that. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers : Great, thanks. Maybe first, David, just any color on what drove the CapEx shift into 2018? And then back to [indiscernible] in beer, should we expect that too to kind of ramp and catch-up in fiscal 2018, commensurate with the CapEx moving? David Klein : So as we indicated earlier, I just want to reiterate, we are on track with all of our buildout activity. I would say that it just \u2013 we have a multi-billion-dollar activity going on in Mexico and it's really difficult to forecast to get the actual dollar amounts of cash payments nailed down to a specific quarter. So I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that going on. And so, anything that slips out of this year we can expect will end up coming through our cash flow statement in FY 2018. And in terms of depreciation and amortization, in my comments earlier, I said that we would be at $125 million of depreciation and amortization for the beer business. That will, just by definition, that growth from about $65 million last year to $125 million this year, that will be somewhat back-end loaded, just given the fact that we\u2019re behind a little bit on a year-to-date basis. Stephen Powers : Okay. David Klein : The other thing, I think, to keep in mind now is that, as I also indicated, we would expect that our margins \u2013 our gross margins in beer will remain roughly flat first half to second half. So there are just a whole bunch of moving pieces there, depreciation just being one of them. Stephen Powers : Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then separately, I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on the response to recent marketing, especially in Modelo. You\u2019ve mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a great payback on that. And, obviously, we see the business results. I just wonder if there are any other ways that you can underneath that mess [ph] of the ROI on these marketing investments, whether in terms real time or relatively real time increases in brand equity or other indicators that give you confidence about the longevity of the ROI related to this investment. Thanks. David Klein : Yeah. So this is something that we spend a fair amount of time on and I would say that our team is outstanding at understanding the returns they\u2019re getting from their marketing investments. And we continue to see payback from our investment in Model Especial. Let me give you an example. When we were talking about our thoughts for the second quarter at the end of the first quarter, we actually thought that we would see a spike in marketing spend in Q2. We did spend more in marketing. But as a percentage of sales, it ended up being in line with our projections simply because we got a significant short-term payback from that investment. So we continue to monitor that on an ongoing basis and that\u2019s our work on the beer side. And as Rob talked about the marketing investment on the wine piece of our business, we\u2019re bringing that same rigor to marketing spend in wine. Stephen Powers : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper : Hi, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you on shelf placements, retailer acceptance as we get into fall shelf resets, what you guys have seen? I have heard kind of rumblings that craft has lost some space and you guys in F&B may have picked up. Just wondering if you could give any color. Robert Sands : Yeah. I think that there's some truth to that. We\u2019re certainly trying to drive that trend through our category management efforts. I would say that, as a general proposition, we probably think craft is over SKU-ed and over-spaced. And imports \u2013 given the importance in the growth, high-end imports are under-SKU-ed and under-spaced. And premium domestics are way over-SKU-ed and over-spaced. That\u2019s something that we spend a lot of time sort of thinking about, which is assortment in the high end especially, and I think we\u2019re in a very strong position to advise our retail customer through our category management initiatives as to ways that they can improve their velocity as well as their profit per-unit space that they\u2019re devoting to beer. So that's a big part of what we\u2019re doing. And I think the trend that you\u2019re alluding to is definitely occurring. And I think that that bodes really well for us in a couple of areas. Craft, even though you are going to see some shake out there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reason because it's moving and it\u2019s highly, highly profitable. And I think that you can say the same about imports because it\u2019s going to become obvious to the retailer that that\u2019s the best way to maximize, as I say, their velocity and profitability for the unit space that they\u2019re devoting to the category. The trend you mentioned is occurring and it bodes extremely well for our entire beer business because we only play in craft and the high end. Brett Cooper : Thanks. And if I can follow-up on pricing, from the data that we see, your pricing is going up much \u2013 or going up more than we\u2019re seeing from others. As you head into, I guess, calendar 2017, thoughts on expanding price gaps, given that you guys continue to drive some meaningful share gains. Robert Sands : Yeah. I'm not sure that our price is really going up more than others. It\u2019s going up to the extent that we\u2019re taking pricing. We\u2019re right in line with sort of the typical, I\u2019d say, inflationary increase that occurs every year and we continue to look at it on a market by market basis. We\u2019re probably under the 2% when we combine everything, sort of between 1% and 2%. I would say that that's normal just to keep up with the pace of \u2013 with cost of goods and inflation and so on and so forth. So nothing different, I would say, is occurring on the pricing front \u2013 period \u2013 industrywide from what we can see. Brett Cooper : Great, thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Laurent Grandet : Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. Congrats, guys. I\u2019ve got a question regarding Ballast Point. You previously stated that \u2013 a goal to have Ballast in 50 states by the calendar year-end. Where are you on this progress? And still on Ballast Point, it seems like the growth is coming from ACV \u2013 it\u2019s coming from, sorry, distribution and ACV, what about the velocity and same-store sales. It seems to be flat to us. So what are you doing to increase the repeat purchase here, which would be critical for that brand? David Klein : So, first of all, on distribution, the brand is in 43 states, plus D.C., and we continue to plan to expand that for the remainder of the year. And as it relates to what sort of runway we have on distribution, it\u2019s a brand that has an ACV of, say, in the low 20s versus some other major crafts that are more in the mid \u2013 low to mid 60s, right? So we think that there's a lot of opportunity on the distribution front. And I would say, as it relates to just overall velocity, I think we have a little bit of an effect as we grow points of distribution that we\u2019re driving down our own brand\u2019s velocity. But we continue to be pleased with the brand, as Rob mentioned. We\u2019ve got depletions that are up 40% on a year-to-date basis. We have \u2013 we\u2019re very pleased with where we are from a profitability standpoint, as we continue to get leverage in the production environment at Ballast Point. So we\u2019re just generally very happy with where we are with Ballast Point. Laurent Grandet : Got it. Thank you. And last one, final, on Ballast, if I may. What would you say to those who said that, with Ballast Point management team leaving, you lost some kind of know-how and craft credentials? Robert Sands : Yeah. I guess I\u2019d say I think it\u2019s the opposite. I think that team certainly had some knowledge and credentials, but I don't think that they have anywhere near the level of the of sophistication and knowledge, okay, that the team that we supplanted them with has. First of all, as far as that team goes, okay, we replaced the CEO with Marty Birkel, who is the guy who ran national sales for our beer business for eight years and probably the fastest growth period in our entire beer business and, therefore, is really one of the stars in the beer business \u2013 period \u2013 and also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. He brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds what the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guys with the number two sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point. And California represented a very large proportion of the business and this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren\u2019t going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say, if anything, we\u2019re really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it is going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don\u2019t think that the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the products itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making, what really is, the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just \u2013 they\u2019re going about their business and doing what they've done in the past and they are probably doing it better than they\u2019ve ever done it before. So there's a lot of really exciting stuff. And then sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained in sort of that fast-moving, craft type business where it\u2019s important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in, that particular craft consumer. So I don't think that we\u2019re going to see anything lost there. We\u2019re very optimistic and very pleased with the changes that we\u2019ve made. Laurent Grandet : Thank you very much for your candid response. Thank you. Operator : That was our final question. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Robert Sands : All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. And as we close out the discussion of our second quarter results, I want to reiterate that I am extremely pleased with our performance and our accomplishments for the first half of the year. [indiscernible] our new guidance reflects the confidence that we have in our ability to execute in the second half. Now, we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming New York City Investor Meeting scheduled for November 9. At that time, we plan to outline Constellation\u2019s strategic business initiatives and outlook for the future. So thanks again and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning everyone Happy New Year and welcome to Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each Q&A session participants to two questions which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty, and good morning and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holiday and had the opportunity to include some of our great Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. Now before we get started with our discussion of third quarter results, I would like to thank those of you who participated in our recent New York Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is better positioned today than it has ever been to generate growth and build value. Our business has never been stronger and the prospects across our beer, wine and spirits portfolio are compelling. We sell a diversified portfolio of fast growing premium brands from the U.S. as well as other parts of the world. Our business continues to produce very impressive results. We are gaining share, improving margins and making smart investments to fuel growth. Consumer demand for our iconic brands remains very strong and we have no reason to expect this to abate. We are so confident about our future business prospects that we recently repurchased more than $800 million worth of our outstanding shares because we believe our stock is undervalued at current levels. I believe it's the changing political and legislative landscape in the U.S. that has recently impacted our stock price, particularly as it relates to potential changes to tax structure, tariffs and trade policies, but I will address this topic in a few moments. With that said, let's focus our discussion on some of the industry leading results we delivered for the third quarter. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth delivering third quarter depletion trends of almost 11% while contributing 60% of total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth and significantly outperforming the high-end of the U.S. beer category. Constellation beers was the clear market winner for Labor Day, outperforming the category and all major competitors while gaining both IRI dollar and volume share with all core import brands driving these gains. In addition to Labor Day, which marked the official close of our 120 days of summer selling season, Constellation was the U.S. beer market growth leader during all key summer holidays including Cinco de Mayo, Memorial Day and July 4. During the quarter, Corona Extra aired TV campaigns during NFL games while continuing to invest in boxing, and the Corona Extra can format and was the number three share gainer overall among high end U.S. brands. Casa Modelo was recently established to include all Modelo brands under a master branding strategy and portfolio approach. During the quarter, this brand family launched new packaging and initiatives for more effective cross promotion and awareness building while setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and line extensions. Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial with a strong presence in the high profile NFL games. These initiatives helped to solidify Modelo Especial as the number two share gainer among all beer brands as well as high-end brands in the U.S. market and drove depletion growth of almost 20% during the third quarter. Pacifico continues to be on fire with nearly 20% depletion growth during the quarter. All core packages are growing with 24-ounce single serve can driving acceleration of the growth for this brand. Ballast Point continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved a solid double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. Operationally, our Nava brewery currently operating at 20 million hectoliters as well as our complete supply chain continues to perform at exceptional levels to support our sales growth through the first three quarters of our fiscal year with planned future expansions at Nava, on or ahead of plan. The Obregon brewery in Mexico remains fully operational as we transition the 400 highly skilled employees who have joined Constellation. They have hit the ground running now that this transaction is closed. This acquisition allows immediate access to functioning brewery capacity to support our fast growing high-end Mexican beer portfolio and provides flexibility for future innovation opportunities. We have also become fully independent from our interim supply agreement with ABI which was terminated with the acquisition. Our Mexicali brewery project has been initially re-scoped to five million hectoliters of production capacity as a result of the Obregon brewery acquisition. The Mexicali construction is picking up momentum and we expect the first module to commission in late calendar year 2019. And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter we advanced our premiumization strategy with the acquisition of Charles Smith Wines and High West Whisky and Distillery. Both of these portfolio additions are off to exceptional starts and place us in categories with excellent potential and upside. Our innovation efforts are also taking a hold with brands like Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet which has become one of the fastest growing super premium SKUs in IRI. The recently introduced Cooper & Thief of Bourbon Barrel-Aged Red Blend at the super luxury price point has been a hit with consumers. And Ravage Cabernet continues to ravage the competition. And Casa Noble Alta Belleza, which is the first addition of a new line of a limited release luxury tequilas that retails for $1,200 began selling recently and has received rave reviews from the media. Our higher margin focus brands drove positive results for the quarter, posting depletion growth of almost 9% driven by excellent trends for most of these brands including Meiomi and The Prisoner which continued to outperform our initial expectations. Many of these focused brands continued to maintain their reputation for excellence among critics with outstanding reviews, rankings and 90-plus scores. The 2013 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve was named among the year's best U.S. Cabernets and blends in Wines and Spirits Magazine and received 95-plus points from Robert Parker in the Wine Advocate. Following a banner year of growth and recognition including IRI's number one New Zealand wine and number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S., Kim Crawford has been named New World Winery of the Year by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Our newly acquired Charles Smith Kung Fu Girl Riesling scored 90 points in both the Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate and was named to the Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines three times in the past four years. Meiomi Pinot Noir achieved the number five slot on wine.com's 2016 Top 100 list. And finally High West Distillery recently received the Distiller of the Year Award from Whiskey Advocate, America's leading whiskey publication. This award represents recognition of excellence, innovation and great tasting whiskey and it credits High West with pioneering a successful new paradigm for craft distilling. We recently sold our Canadian wine business as part of our strategy to focus on premium margin accretive growth opportunities. This strategic action was also the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value enhancing opportunities to strengthen the financial portfolio of our overall wine and spirits business. I am also pleased to report that Constellation Ventures has been busy investing in two new minority interests, the newest which is Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, a producer of premium rye whiskey and gin from organic sources. Earlier in the quarter, we also announced Bardstown Bourbon, the largest new whiskey distillery in the U.S. Both of these investments provide us with the opportunity to further explore innovation in the brown spirits category. Now before I turn the call over to David, I think it's worth taking a moment to address some of the more frequent investor inquiries we have received since Election Day, including what potential changes under our new administration could mean for Constellation going forward. One specific aspect of a proposed Republican tax reform plan called border adjustability could potentially disallow a deduction for foreign sourced COGS or cost of goods sold. As you know, our imported Mexican brands can only be authentically produced in Mexico and sold in the U.S. In order to understand how different tax reform proposals could impact our business, we have modeled several different potential scenarios that include border adjustability as well as some of the positive facets of a corporate tax reform plan based on what we know today. Overall, there are many unknowns related to future legislation and it's still too early to make a definitive call on final outcomes and timing because the legislation has not been written. As more details develop on these policies and legislation materialized, you can be assured we are prepared to respond accordingly. As you would expect, we are closely monitoring the situation and we have significant resources dedicated to this effort. We have been working directly with our legislators to safeguard our ability to continue to cost effectively produce and sell our imported beer, wine and spirits products in the U.S. Under every scenario of proposed tax reform, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the strategic goals we outlied during our recent New York Investor Meeting. To reiterate these goals, we believe we can achieve EPS growth at a rate greater than 10% over the next three years and we think Constellation is a very compelling investment which can produce significant value for our shareholders. Our team is committed to delivering industry-leading returns. We think we have the right brands, the right leadership and the right strategies to do so. The fundamentals of our business have never been stronger and we believe that Constellation provides the best-in-class combination of sustainable topline growth and profitability in the consumer space. We continue to build shareholder value, commercially, operationally and through significant share repurchases under our $1 billion stock buyback program while remaining committed to our leverage target. I am also proud of the fact that we recently achieved investment grade status for the first time of the history in the company. With all that said, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our third quarter financial results. David? David Klein : Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our impressive financial results for Q3 and our recent business accomplishments as we continue to grow share and outperform the competition. Our continued strong topline and operating results were accompanied by a favorable tax rate benefit related to APB 23 accounting as we determined that a portion of our foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. This assertion allows the company to record income taxes on certain foreign earnings using the applicable foreign jurisdiction tax rates rather than the higher U.S. tax rate. The fiscal 2017 year-to-date impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and helped drive comparable basis diluted EPS growth of 38%. As a result, we are now projecting a lower tax rate for the year and this is driving an increase in our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.55 to $6.65 versus our previous guidance of $6.30 to $6.45. Looking at our Q3 fiscal 2017 performance in more detail, we are all generally focused on a comparable basis financial results. You can see beer net sales grew 16%, organic beer, net sales increased 12% primarily due to volume growth of 10% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 11%. Wine and spirits net sales increased 5%. This reflects the acquisition benefit from The Prisoner Wine Brands and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume due to timing as U.S. depletion volume outpaced shipment volume during the quarter. Our U.S. depletions grew a little over 3% in Q3. Beer operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 34.8%. The impact of planned marketing investments and consolidation of the Ballast Point business were mostly offset by benefits from pricing and foreign currency. For the Q3 year-to-date period, beer operating margin was 35.8%, up almost a full percentage point versus the same period last year. Looking more closely at beer SG&A, about half of the year-over-year increase in beer SG&A for the quarter was due to an increase in marketing spend. A majority of the remaining increase was driven by the overlap of a re-class from SG&A into COGS during Q3 of FY 2016. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 27.3%. Investments in SG&A and marketing were mostly offset by favorable COGS, benefit from the addition of The Prisoner Wine Brands and favorable mix. On a year-to-date basis, wine operating margin increased 80 basis points to 25.6%. Interest expense for the quarter increased $2 million as higher average borrowings were mostly offset by lower average interest rates. Equity earnings totaled $28 million and were generated primarily by Opus One. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.4% versus 32.3% for Q3 last year. This reflects the benefit of APB 23 which I highlighted earlier as the fiscal 2017 year-to-date impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. We now expect our full year fiscal 2017 comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 27%. Let me spend a few moments discussing our debt leverage ratio in recent business and capital allocation activities. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q3 totaled $8.4 billion, an increase of $436 million since the end of fiscal 2016. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5 times at the end of Q3 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal 2016. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 does not reflect the full year of EBITDA benefit from our premium wine and spirits brand acquisitions including The Prisoner acquisition, which was funded during Q1 and Charles Smith and High West acquisitions which were funded during Q3. During the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Fitch and Standard & Poor's to an investment grade designation. We are proud of this achievement and are committed to maintaining the status moving forward. We saw the benefit of this upgrade in early December when we completed a $600 million senior notes offering. These notes are due in 2026 and carry an attractive interest rate of 3.7%. In December, as part of our efforts to increase focus on higher margin, higher growth premium brands, we completed the sale of our Canadian wine business in a transaction valued at CAD1.04 billion. We received cash proceeds net of outstanding debt of CAD775 million or $581 million. We received the proceeds from the outstanding debt prior to the sale. In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize a net gain on the transaction, which is preliminarily estimated to be $255 million. In addition, we expect to pay income tax of approximately $70 million in connection with the divestiture with most of that payment expected to occur in fiscal 2017. At the end of December, we acquired the Obregon brewery operation from ABI for $5 83 million, net of cash acquired. This provides us with immediate functioning brewing capacity to support our growth, supply independence from ABI and flexibility for future innovation. We are committed to delivering shareholder value using every tool at our disposal. During the quarter we carefully reviewed the growth targets which were presented at our Investor Day in November in the context of tax reform. After diligent review, we determined that all of the targets remain appropriate as stated. This work provided us with confidence that the purchase of our shares would create value for our shareholders. Therefore we purchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $367 million during Q3 and in December purchased an additional three million shares at a cost of $450 million. All of the activity I just highlight demonstrates management's ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing business conditions, the strength of our financial profile, the capital allocation flexibility we have as we operate at our leverage target and the confidence we have in our ability to execute our premiumization strategy, drive profitable growth and build shareholder value over the long term. Now let's review free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we generated $824 million of free cash flow compared to $578 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up 30% primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first nine months of the year was $592 million compared to $514 million for the prior year period. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance by $100 million to a range of $825 million to $925 million. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Mexicali brewery capital related payments to next year. We are also lowering our full year operating cash flow guidance by $100 million to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This is being driven primarily by anticipated tax payments associated with the Canadian wine business divestiture and the loss of Canadian wine business operating cash flow during the fourth quarter. Given these offsetting factors, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 free cash flow to be in the range of $575 million to $675 million. Moving to our full year fiscal 2017 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65 and the increase is being driven primarily by our lower projected tax rate. Our beer business continues to target net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% and operating income growth in the high teens. This guidance continues to target beer operating margins in the 35% to 36% range. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. Interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million and weighted average shares are now targeted at 204.5 million. These updates reflect the share repurchase activity I noted earlier. I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. In closing, our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 have us on track to achieve another phenomenal year of growth and financial performance. Our focus on strong marketplace execution and making smart investments to support our business continues to strengthen our business and financial model providing us confidence in our ability to drive sustainable profitable growth and build shareholder value over the long term. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hi Dara. Dara Mohsenian : First on the SG&A side. Clearly you posted a high increase year-over-year as a percent of sales at the corporate level in the quarter that was driven by both beer and wine and the beer comments were helpful. But I was hoping in wine, you could also give us a sense of how much of the increase in SG&A was due to marketing moving up as a percent of sales versus maybe other factors? And what those other factors are and how long they might last? David Klein : So as a dollar amount delta year-over-year the wine increase similar to the beer increase was about half marketing spend as we invest more in our brands on the wine side and the other half was just investments primarily in people to drive our execution and NPD capabilities. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And are those people costs and those execution capabilities, is that something you lap over in a couple more quarters in cycle or is it something that's just beginning at this point? Last quarter you had some spending in those areas too. So I am just wondering when you cycle over that? David Klein : Yes. I would expect fundamentally that our SG&A range, really in both of our business, will remain in line with where it's been historically over time as a percentage of sales. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then on border adjustability, the comments were helpful. I am curious if you did need to take a large price increase to offset any changes in taxes, could you clarify if you think distributors and retailers would more just pass on the dollar profit impact of any price increases from Constellation or do you think they might look to more to maintain margins not just offsetting the profit dollar impact? And then also you have showed a willingness to price to offset cost historically in beer. Conceptually, if the tax change was large in nature, would you be willing to consider a mid to high single digit price increase, if needed, to offset taxes? Is that kind of in the range of scenarios you run when thinking about the tax changes that you mentioned earlier? David Klein : So Dara, when we look at the tax changes and I just really want to caution everybody because we are talking to people in Congress on this topic and the border adjustability provision haven't even been written, right. So it's hypothetical and of course, we are trying to understand the effects that could take place, but it's hard to get into a lot of specifics when answering. But I would say that we still would suspect that our pricing algorithm would remain consistent where it's been in the past in the range of 1% to 2% a year and in order to mitigate any sort of a border tax, we would be more inclined to address elements of the supply chain that we would put into the deductible category. So for example, if you look at elements of our cost inputs that currently come from the U.S. that we could make deductible, I would put, say, the energy cost of producing glass in Mexico. That's just one example of things we can do in our supply chain. So we turn that into a U.S. cost instead of a Mexican cost and we then have a deductible expense for U.S. tax purposes. We think that combined with a lower U.S. tax rate and a reasonable phase-in period for any border adjustment tax would be a more appropriate and value creating approach than to really just jump on the price lever. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good morning. Rob Sands : Good morning Viv. Vivien Azer : So just in thinking about the beer trends, I think there has been a little bit of anxiety from some of the investors that we have talked to this morning around the [3Q plan] [ph] and beer results coming in a little bit below expectations and I think that's being exacerbated by some of the press reports about the preliminary Nielsen numbers through December. So two part question for me, please. Number one, can you walk us through the phasing of your beer trends through the quarter to help kind of put the December numbers that we are seeing from Nielsen in context? And number two, can you offer any perspective on why you thought December might have been soft? And in particular, what's going on with craft beer in that context? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes. Vivian, number one, we don't think that the quarter was soft at all. And if you look at IRI trends, for instance consumer takeaway, this quarter our growth was up to the most recent reporting period 16% whereas last quarter, right, it was below that at approximately 14%. So we are actually seeing an acceleration at retail on consumer takeaway. And then if you look at our depletion results for the quarter, we were at 10.7% depletion growth, but this quarter we were overlapping 16.2% depletion growth for the same quarter last year. And if you look at last quarter, we had 13.8% growth, which was higher than the same quarter or second quarter last year, which was 10.2%. Now, the fundamental point is that these kind of fluctuations quarter-by-quarter in depletions are not indicative of much of anything as long as they are in a range, right, of the kind of growth we have been experiencing, which is double digit growth in the low teens. You are going to continue to see fluctuations of this nature quarter-to-quarter in depletions based on what's happening with inventories at retail, shipments into our retail customers, et cetera. So you can't go by changes of, say, 100 basis points to judge whether the business is soft or not. The simple fact is that consumer takeaway for our products is accelerating, okay, sequentially as we look at our results. So I don't think that we believe or see any softness whatsoever in the business and in fact I would say, it's the opposite, okay, at the consumer level to the extent that it can be measured. We are actually seeing acceleration and I am sure that that will shake out from a depletion point of view over the medium term meaning throughout the year and into next year. So very, very, very strong results. We are the leader in growth in beer in every possible respect and contributing most of the growth to the entire industry. So we think our results are, in actuality, outstanding. They have double-digit growth. Following a 16.2% overlap is actually almost unbelievable. Vivien Azer : Understood. That's helpful. And could you comment at all, please, on December, if you had a chance to take a look at that data and your view on some of the softness in the scanner data for December? And then if you could comment please on the broader slowdown that we are seeing in craft beer? Thanks. Rob Sands : I think that number one, December continues to be strong. We don't really see, I mean, we don't pay that much attention to month-over-month fluctuations, but December continues to be strong results. Yes, we were up, what, 13% in IRI in December. So actually it continues to be very strong trends. And as far as craft goes, look, I mean craft is a tale of two cities, right. You can't look at the craft number as a total number. I mean what continues to go on in craft is the major brands, Sam, Sierra Nevada, Blue Moon, which are all on the craft numbers, those continued to be down big time, right, like in the, I don't know, about 8% range. And then you have sort of everything else which continues to be up significantly and is not being dragged by those numbers. And you have also got the, what I will call, the local effect which is a lot of the smaller local craft players eating up many of those larger older brands, which are now 25 years old. So as I said, it's really a tale of two cities, but most importantly Ballast Point's IRI trends were up 54%, okay, for the quarter and it continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the category and it is certainly the most premium significantly sized brand in the category. So while you are you are seeing a lot of stuff kind of going out in craft, it's really not something that you can think of, I think, in terms of like a total category because it's almost a meaningless term. It's a brand-by-brand phenomenon. And so you really have to look at the specific brands and companies that you are concerned about as to how they are performing. Vivien Azer : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Rob Sands : Hi Judy. Judy Hong : Hi. Good Morning. So a couple of follow-ups on the border adjustability comment. First, just in terms of and I completely understand it's not even written as part of the legislation, but what are you hearing in terms of the potential carve-out if indeed the border adjustability is included as a part of the tax reform? And then David, you have talked about some portion of your beer costs already classified as U.S. costs. So can you give us the number today and potentially what that can get to? Rob Sands : Yes. So thank you for caveating that it hasn't been written because I think I am going to say that every time anyone asks about border adjustability, right. So we are in the field of concepts here. Our understanding is that U.S. based COGS will be deductible. And right now our U.S. based component of our beer COGS, inclusive of freight, is about 40%. I mean 60% of the COGS is from Mexico. Now we have things that we can do within our supply chain over time, but we are talking about long-term supply agreements. We would have to take into account changes in freight and of course, any changes or fluctuations in currency between the countries before you make final plans like that. So I would say, when we do our modeling, we are looking at kind of staying in the range of foreign COGS that we have today and then picking up the benefits that are included in the rest of the tax package and assuming a reasonable phase-in period which is how we come back to having a great deal of comfort in saying that we can grow EPS greater than 10% as we described in November. Judy Hong : Okay. And then just any color just you are hearing in terms of the carve-out prospects? Rob Sands : What do you mean by a carve-out prospects, Judy? Judy Hong : So if border adjustability is included, could Mexican beer be exempt from that adjustability? Rob Sands : Sure. It's possible that Mexican beer could be exempt because it's an inherently Mexican product and it's not the kind of thing that perhaps is being targeted, i.e., the movement of production from the U.S. to Mexico. In fact, in our particular case it's the complete opposite in which you have a U.S. company that bought an inherently Mexican company and actually resulted in the creation of jobs in the U.S. as opposed to the opposite. So of course we are making that point with our legislators and I would say they fully understand and comprehend that point. So yes, there could be a carve-out. But I think more importantly, I would reiterate what David said, number one, we are not necessarily relying upon a carve-out. Number two, what we have been told, if you believe that border adjustability will in fact occur, which is a big maybe in the first place, if it does, there will be a relatively lengthy phase-in period. That's what our legislators and the people on Ways and Means, et cetera are saying. And then, furthermore as David pointed, we would have significant ability to mitigate the effect of it by moving COGS, right, from Mexico to the U.S. So David gave a good example of it. Energy, which is a very large component in the manufacture of glass, glass being the largest component of COGS we buy out of Mexico right now. We could shift our purchase of natural gas from Mexico to the U.S. and increase our cost of goods sold component that's U.S. based and therefore mitigate the impact of the lack of deductibility of foreign COGS. So it's those kind of things that we are looking at, planning of, if this comes to pass so that we can maintain, as David said, our current pricing algorithm which is sort of in the 1% to 2%. And therefore we don't expect consumer demand for our product to be effected by border adjustability in any timeframe that's probably relevant to our investors. Judy Hong : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on Ballast Point. Rob Sands : And Judy, I would also point out that the other benefits of tax reform is being suggested in the Better Way Plan being put forth by the House, right, has very significant other benefits which will also offset any negative from border adjustability. So I think it could be a net positive when all is said and done, but it remains to be seen. As David has said, the only details we get are from talking to the legislators who are involved right now in, I will say, contemplating the details of these proposals. And that's the best anybody can know. And I would say, we probably know more about this than anybody, any corporation. Judy Hong : Yes. That's really helpful. So thanks for that. Just if I can ask a quick question on Ballast Point. So just in terms of the contribution to your sales, it looks like it's slowed pretty meaningfully versus first half and then maybe even implying a down year-over-year. So just wondering if there's any kind of a destocking going on, just from a shipment perspective for Ballast? And then just in terms of -- Rob Sands : There is nothing going on with Ballast. The business is up double digits. The IRI is up 54%. There is nothing going on with it at all. And it's a very small contributor to the results. I mean it's a very small business, right. So it's not meaningfully contributing to any of the numbers that we are talking about, but it will and one of these days, because it is a very fast grower and it continues to grow well. So it's part of our strategy to continue to drive the portfolio towards growth brands and that strategy is working very well, by the way Judy Hong : Got it. Thank you for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning everyone. Rob Sands : Hi Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. I just have a couple of quick follow-on questions. First on your total beer business. Could you drill down on how your on-premise business has been performing versus off-premise? And then curious to hear how your beer business has been performing in the untracked channels off-premise? And then could you touch on where you are at with national distribution for Ballast Point, please? Thanks. David Klein : Yes. So in terms of on-premise and off-premise, our beer business is up high single digits in the on-premise. We think the market's down low to mid single digits in the on-premise. So we are gaining share and feeling very, very comfortable there. And on your last question, I have it here, as it relates to Ballast Point's distribution, I think Ballast Point is about 25. So ACV is about 25 and we are in about 45 states. But what I want to caution when we talk about expanding into incremental states is that if we sell a case in a state we say that we are in that state. We really need to continue to drive the sales execution and broadening of the base in each state that we go into with Ballast Point. So there is a lot of runway in front of us as it relates to Ballast Point. Bonnie Herzog : So you expect that continued push on distribution to continue well into next year before you feel like you have gained additional -- David Klein : Well, it will continue way beyond next year. Bonnie Herzog : Yes. David Klein : It's hardly in distribution outside of California, right. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then just circling back on maybe the untracked channels off-premise, just trying to get a sense of how your business is performing there, just since we are all looking at scanner data. David Klein : I would say that our business is performing similar to what you are seeing in the tracked off-premise channel in the untracked off-premise channels. So that's about the best we can tell you, but we have no reason to believe otherwise. So I suppose taking a look at, well, we have no reason to believe otherwise. Let me put it that way. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. All right. David Klein : Based on our shipment to distributors and they reported depletions. Business is, as I had said, very, very strong. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you so much. Rob Sands : Thanks Bonnie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Mark Swartzberg : Great. Thank you. Rob Sands : Hi Mark. Mark Swartzberg : Hi Rob. Hi Dave. Morning everyone. So a few questions. I will try to leave Mexico for the moment, but I will come back there. You are doing very well with your balance sheet. You have been very aggressive recently buying your shares. It picked up further in terms of monthly pace in December. You have got this new authorization that, in a sense you are close to being done with, if you take the pace you had already acted out in December. So, the simple question is, the two of you as people advising the Board and saying, hey, we want to do this or that, how interested are you in presenting to the Board another $1 billion dollar authorization? David Klein : Well, first of all, Mark, we have $800 million approximately remaining on the recent authorization. And just for clarity, I think that we had $600 million or $700 million remaining on our previous authorization that we spent as part of these repurchases and then we went into the new authorization by about $200 million. Mark Swartzberg : Right. And so my question is, the pace you are going at implies you are going to be done with that new authorization rather quickly. So what's your appetite for asking for an additional authorization? Rob Sands : The Board would be completely amenable to giving us any authorization that we ask for because of the fact that David mentioned was, we think that our shares are, especially today, significantly undervalued. That said, we have $800 million left on our authorization. So it's really not much of an issue at the moment. We will continue to make share repurchases opportunistically as we have in the past and the only caveat on that is that we do desire to stay within our debt target of approximately 3.5, which is also important and to therefore maintain our investment grade ratings. So that's probably the only real caveat on making stock repurchases, but hey, we are gung ho on stock repurchases. So no on needs to convince us of that strategy. Mark Swartzberg : All right. And your balance sheet is much more suited. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the beer business on the front, so to speak, you mentioned how we should think about the increase in SG&A and part of it is just an accounting change, but the portion that you referred to as half, you said half of the increases is attributable to increase in marketing spend. And I think one of the things that we are all trying to understand is, how much should we think that that's already shown up in a sense in the quarter and the way the depletion is already performed? And how much of that is kind of a yet to come benefit? And I realize, no one has a crystal ball, but can you give us a sense, like how much of that was trade related, how much of that increase was consumer related? Because we are just trying to get a sense of, do we already see the benefits or other some benefits yet to come and maybe trade versus consumer is one way to think about that? David Klein : So, the increase in marketing spend was mostly at the consumer level. And when I talked about increase, I am really talking about the dollar increase. We haven't really changed our overall strategy in terms of marketing expense as a percent of net sales. And so we still expect that to be in the 8.5% to 9% range and we track that very diligently to make sure that we are getting a return for it and we continue to see the returns as we invest in our brands and the best example I can give is that this year we started investing from a marketing standpoint in Pacifico and we are seeing Pacifico, for example, in the last 12 weeks is up 27% in IRI. So you can expect us to continue to do that but I think as a percentage of sales, we really haven't changed our strategy. Mark Swartzberg : That's great. Okay. And then specifically in the case of border adjustability and sort of an immediate benefit that's come with Donald Trump being elected President is the peso has depreciated. So with the peso depreciating, you have talked to us historically about the portion of your COGS that are denominated in pesos. Is there any benefit above simply that depreciation benefit we should be thinking about? Is there something that's affecting your peso denominated inputs themselves? Or the hiring dynamics? I realize we are only kind of two months since November 8, but I am just trying to get a sense of how Mexico's economy, so to speak, is affecting your cost in Mexico? David Klein : Yes. So about 25% of our costs are peso denominated which disconnects a little bit from the percentage that I said earlier, so 60% of our COGS being Mexican. And the difference is dollar denominated contracts for goods that we purchase in Mexico, those contracts themselves really have an underlying FX component to them. They are denominated in dollars and it may take longer for any benefit from that to flow through. And as it relates to the Mexican economy, we are not seeing any issues from a hiring or a labor standpoint or costs within Mexico. So we are seeing no problem. We are also not seeing any significant benefits. Mark Swartzberg : Great. And then final question, I don't know if you touched on this or not, but you have drawn our attention again to the fact that 60% of your COGS for the beer business are relating to the operations in Mexico and your openness to moving glass or some other element to a location north of the border. But can you tell us, if we take a long view, a three-year view, a five-year view, a 10-year view, what portion of that 60% in your mind is eligible for movement north of the border? David Klein : Yes. That's harder to get to and I think you have to take into account any discussion of this we could really only have after we know the specifics of any sort of border tax because I think you would have to look at the actual cost of purchase of changing moving supply chain components to the U.S.. You would have to take into account freight and then of course you would have to take into account the currency delta. And maybe there is a scenario where the currency delta makes moving the supply chain irrelevant, right. So I think we would have to play that through when we actually know the conditions on the ground and we can't really know that today. Rob Sands : But I think your question, as you are really talking about the longer-term, it could be the majority of it because although the beer has to be made in Mexico, a lot of the components could be shifted if it was really determined to be advantageous and labor which is required to make and bottle the beer is a very small percentage of the total tax. So it's only 15% of the COGS. So you get the vast majority of it in one way or another U.S. based. Mark Swartzberg : If the currency supports that. Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you guys. David Klein : And you also -- Rob Sands : And the details of everything else and all of the puts and takes with everything else. I mean, we wouldn't just totally disrupt the supply chain over the long run if it's not necessary. But we do have quite a bit of flexibility in what we can do. So hence our optimism obviously relative to this whole matter and as also evidenced by our view on our own stock value and our buyback activity. Mark Swartzberg : I wanted to ask one last legislative thing, this isn't so much a Constellation question, but your point, Rob, about having better insight into what's happening to Washington in the many companies is simply the Senate. So we know what Kevin Brady and the House have put out there. We know what Donald Trump thinks. We know what Paul Ryan thinks. But do you have any sense of either timing or leadership in the Senate when we are going to actually hear some of it from the Senate speaking with some clarity about how they are thinking about this matter? Rob Sands : Well, I think that Hatch made some comments yesterday saying that he doesn't know yet what their view or opinion is on any of this. I have talked to Schumer myself personally and I would say that on the Senate side everybody is pretty reserved as to where this whole thing is going. So I would say that there is a lot less clarity on the Senate side than there is on the House side. And I would say we know a lot more about it than anybody else and that we are told that other companies that should be concerned about this are just waking up to the whole matter whereas we have been focused on it from the very beginning, having met ourselves with Ryan several months ago, really over the last summer. So we have been quite aware of this and thinking about it. Hence as David has pointed out, we have been thinking well in advance of strategically all of the things that we can do and will do if necessary to mitigate the impacts of this. So I think we are totally ahead of the game, which is good because I think as our comfort level now is indicative of that fact, which is that we have been so far ahead of the game that we sort of know what we are going to do and we are not sort of relying upon or hopefully this won't happen or what the probabilities are because that's like nobody can predict any of that stuff. So all we can do is around and determine what our action items will be if something occurs and how we are going to do it. So as I said, we are pretty far advanced in that thinking. Mark Swartzberg : Very helpful. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Thanks very much. Hi. Good morning. Just going back to your commentary on wanting to stay within the investment grade bounds, sort of a more liberal interpretation of debt ceilings has really served Constellation well over the couple decades and certainly over the last five or six years. What is that makes you more comfortable in that 3.5 times or below range? And is this a change in the rating agencies viewing 3.5 times as investment grade which maybe wasn't done in the past? Or is this comfort on your level that you don't need to lever beyond that? Rob Sands : I think David will answer this as well. I will just give you my quick view on this which is that, it's really a size and scale thing, right. Our EBIT and margins and the cash flow that this company is and will be generating, especially as we complete over the next couple of years, our large capital projects pretty much give us, I would say, the flexibility to do everything that we could possibly want to do without really having to deviate from sort of that mid three range. That could deviate a little bit from time-to-time but I don't really see that it's important. I mean we are going to have so much cash generation that we feel pretty comfortable that we can pretty much internally fund just about anything that you could conceivably do in the alcoholic beverage business, right. Tim Ramey : Sure. Rob Sands : So that's just my view on it. David? David Klein : Yes. I would just reiterate that $2.5 billion of EBITDA that's generated every year, you can stay at the 3.5 times and you have fair amount of capital to allocate to other activities. And I would say that where we are focused on saying that we will stay at the 3.5 times. We are not looking to be leveraged below 3.5 times and if we go above 3.5 times, we would then want to get back to that number, but we are really thinking about it, Tim, as a target. Tim Ramey : Yes. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the investment grade rating and the continued tremendous business momentum. On that point, you mentioned very interestingly, that you have actually seen on a sequential basis an acceleration in the beer business. And I am wondering if you could be perhaps a little bit more specific in terms of what you think the potential triggers of that acceleration are? Is it particular new SKUs? Is it Corona cans? Your c-store initiatives? The increased marketing? Probably a little bit all of the above, but I would love to get your thoughts on that. Rob Sands : Yes. Well, I think first of all, you gave it pretty good litany of all of the things that are driving it. Our marketing, our advertising, cans, SKUs, those are all things that continue to drive our consumer takeaway. And then there's some increased distribution is another big focus of ours and getting the right distribution in the right places. I mean it is not just the increased distribution by the numbers, it\u2019s quality of distribution so that all relates to sales execution. So that's kind of motherhood and apple pie and we are doing a great job with it. I think also, if you sort of look at what's going on retail with even the craft segment, there is definitely now a movement to reduce the number of SKUs. That is causing some regained focus at retail which we always thought that at this ought to happen. The really fast growing high margin bread and butter items that they have, which happens to be our portfolio and therefore more attention, more space, more distribution is being given to what they know is working versus what hasn't worked. I think that takes us back to a Ballast Point point of, okay, which is as you see some slowdown in the older more established craft types brands, a brand like Ballast Point which will be supported, has strong sales execution behind it, these are the types of brands that will be the beneficiary as things shake out a little more in the craft segment as well our import portfolio because it's clear-cut that that's what's driving all the growth in the beer business at retail. So I think that we will see our sort of total portfolio be the beneficiary of sort of constant or anticipated changes that will occur over time, as has always occurred. I mean there's always been these kind of changes in the business. On the one hand, it's a slow business to change. On the other hand, there is constant change going on with all three categories. Rob Ottenstein : And in terms of that retailer re-spacing or kind of re-looking at their SKUs and we certainly heard about that from Walmart, about when do you think that's started? Has that been going on throughout 2016, calendar 2016? Or did you see that really pick up in the second half of the year? Rob Sands : I think that it's actually in its infancy. I think it's just starting. But you take a Walmart, for instance, I mean they love our products because they are trying to, they want higher margin fast moving growing products on their shelf, because they don't have that much space devoted to the category. So they want all the best stock. Rob Ottenstein : Terrific. Rob Sands : I think it's just starting and I think that you will see us, as I said, there's always changes that are going on in the industry across all three categories and the key, strategically, is to make sure that you are positioned to be the positive beneficiary of those changes. And that's why we make some of the comments that we do about being better positioned as a company than we have ever have been because it's pretty clear to us that given our whole portfolio and our strategy and our premiumization strategy and our focus towards high margin, high growth brands that that's really positions us to be the key, not one of but the key beneficiary of all of the changes that are going on. And look, you see that in our results versus every other beverage alcohol company, right. Frankly versus almost any other company in consumer goods, period. There is no companies in consumer goods in general that are performing like we are that I am aware of. Rob Ottenstein : No. It's tremendous. Rob Sands : Even some of the ones that are outside of our industry and category and have not consistently performed as we have. So we are a bit of an outlier in that regard. And we hope to continue to be so. Rob Ottenstein : Absolutely. And then just on cost side, I believe in the last quarter you mentioned that you thought advertising spend as a percent of sales would be flattish in the second half of the big chunk in the third quarter as we just saw versus the fourth quarter. Do you still stand by that? David Klein : Yes. I would say that on an absolute dollar basis, once again we will see some year-over-year growth in marketing spend. But from a model perspective, our marketing spend will end up in that 8.5% to 9% range for the full year. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. So just quick question on the taxes. I think you talked about a lower tax rate for 2018. I assume there's no change in kind of the outlook there. David Klein : No. So we talked about having a mid 20s sort of ETR as a target over the next three years and we are not really giving guidance for FY 2018, but there's no reason to expect that would be outside of that. Bill Chappell : Okay. Thanks. And then also just to make sure I understood, the net leverage at the end of the quarter, that includes the cash used for share repurchase? I am just trying to understand kind of where we stand as of today. David Klein : Yes. So that 3.5 times was at the end of the quarter. I would say, if the year were to end today we are probably more in the 3.6 to 3.7 range, given the repurchases that took place in December. Bill Chappell : And in terms of future share repurchases, you are comfortable going above four times? David Klein : I would say, again, we are focused on the 3.5 times range and if appropriate opportunities present themselves from a capital allocation standpoint, we will go above the 3.5 times but our objective is to always be able to quickly get back to that level. But again, we have maintain on the 3.5 times versus trying to just how high we could actually go. Bill Chappell : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Laurent Grandet : Yes. Hello. Thanks for the opportunity. So I would like to come back to this SG&A point. SG&A went up to 19.5% in the quarter from about 17%, 17.5% in the previous quarters and you mentioned at the same time that the marketing spend was of roughly 8.5% to 9% of sales, roughly similar to the previous quarters. So I really would like to understand, I mean where is the balance of the SG&A? And is it something we should see in the future quarters? And is it some kind of initiatives, I mean, to support new brand introductions or to go after the on-premise channel? So I like to really have more color about these SG&A and how we should think about it going forward? David Klein : Yes. So again from holding aside quarter-to-quarter volatility in total SG&A spend, I would say that for, just focused only on the beer business, our marketing spend will be somewhere between 8.5% to 9% of net sales. In terms of SG&A spend in our beer business, we expect that it stays in the historical range that's really in 5.5% to 6% range, specifically in our beer business. And the incremental growth in SG&A in both businesses, really any incremental spend there is put in place to really drive innovation and better sales execution. But again, our SG&A algorithm is not changing. These are just quarter-over-quarter anomalies. Laurent Grandet : Okay. Thank you very much. And an in terms of focus, I would like to come back on this final question on Ballast Point. I understand we do have vision on sales of 45% to ball park it, similarly to IRI. But if we dig more into the numbers and we see that the distribution now has been plateauing at about 23% for the last six quarters. And same store sales seems to be now at minus 25 and that's for the last few quarters. So was the plan here to kind of push even further Ballast Point? I understand it's still a small part of your algorithm but also it's important for the future of the gross of the beer segment of your business. Rob Sands : No. We have got all kinds of programs to drive distribution of the product. And throughout the United States we have taken the brand national. We have very strong relationships with our distributors. We are increasing our support levels behind the brand and doing all of the standard things that one would do in this particular category and that's an important caveat to drive the business. So it's all about doing things like driving national accounts. These kind of brands require a lot of grassroots type efforts. We continue to develop new products. We continue to develop our retail model. We continue to win awards, which is important in the craft segment because it's a lot like wine and ratings and I think we are on the forefront of that in actuality. So it's all good. There is just nothing to be concerned about or to complain about. Laurent Grandet : Thanks for adding some comfort on this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS. Stephen Powers : Hi. Great. Thank you. Back to taxes, I guess really two questions, if I could. First, your comments on board adjustability have been very helpful. But I am wondering if you could comment also on what discussions you may have had around interest expense deductibility and how that aspect of potential tax reform has factored into the scenarios you have talked about? And then second, I just wanted to test whether your confidence in the 10% growth algorithm through 2020 under potential tax reform depends on the phase-in assumptions that you mentioned? Or if you have modeled scenarios where sort of the adverse aspects may take effect more quickly and you could still hit the 10% number? David Klein : Yes. So in terms of interest deductibility, I think the general assumption, under the Better Way Plan, is that it wouldn't be deductible on a go-forward basis. Our assumption there is that existing interest would remain deductible. And then in terms of phase-in, the last time there was tax reform, I think the phase-in period was four years. But this sort of tax reform really isn't about just setting up back office accounting departments to manage the new tax code. This kind of tax reform would require a time horizon that would allow companies to change their entire supply chain. So our expectation is that it would at least be four years and our objective would be to advocate to make that as long as possible so that we could actually get through up in supply agreements and so forth. And so I would say that when we start looking at the three-year numbers, I think there are a couple of things that play into it. And one is the phase-in period, of course and we are not assuming that it's just an immediate phase-in. And then I think the other component that you have to keep in mind is, if you look at in particular peso rates historically, for us, versus the current peso rates, so not incremental currency movement, but the current peso rate, it actually provides benefits to us that would be somewhat offsetting as we sit here today. Rob Sands : But I think that it's not just phase-in, right. When do you think that the actual tax reform legislation will be enacted? Stephen Powers : Right. Rob Sands : I mean it's probably a year off at best. Stephen Powers : Yes. Rob Sands : Right. Stephen Powers : Yes. No, okay. That's all fair. Just wanted to get someone to clarify. Rob Sands : We can only tell you what our legislators have been telling us, right. But the first thing that's going to happen in Congress, which you are seeing right now is Obamacare. Stephen Powers : Yes. Rob Sands : So Congress has a lot on its plate right now. And to work through all of the details and get legislation like that passed, well, Congress is telling us it's going to be a while in any event. And it is clear cut and again this is literally what we have been told by the leaders that Obamacare is the first thing on their plate. Stephen Powers : Okay. That's helpful. Rob Sands : And that's going to take a while. Stephen Powers : Okay. And I don't want to get too far into the weeds here, but I just want to make sure I am thinking about this correctly from what you are currently doing. It looks to me like today what you are doing in terms of, you are essentially leveraging some pretty high transfer prices from Mexico to the U.S. to keep profits today outside the U.S. I think 60% of your pre-tax income effectively is booked outside the U.S. today. So I am assuming in the future you would theoretically be able to reduce those transfer prices, shift dollars, shift profits back to the U.S., hopefully at a lower tax rate and that's as part of the levers you can pull. Can you just talk me through the transfer pricing algorithm there? David Klein : Yes. You shouldn't even think about that, right. So the transfer prices so still at market rates. You just have to think about the deductible component of COGS, which really doesn't change. What matters is where you incur the costs, not necessarily where you have put the revenue. Stephen Powers : Okay. So you put the revenue wherever the tax rate was most advantaged? David Klein : Yes. So it's a shift in mindset on border adjustability. It's really all about the COGS sourcing. Stephen Powers : Okay. The last thing, not on tax, I just wanted to see if you could just add some comments on Corona Premier. There's been some, I guess from my perspective, some degree of apprehension from the marketplace in terms of maybe pushing that too far to the detriment of mainline Corona. So just wanted to get a sense for what your rollout plan was there and how big, how small, how fast, how slow, that kind of thing? Rob Sands : We are going to test market it in three or four different markets of different types, meaning more mature and less mature markets to get a good handle on how it interacts with our other products and then make a decision as to whether we will continue the product and roll it out or not. I don't see any big issue with it. Our distributors, they are excited about it. The category is a good category. Mic Ultra is one of the leading growth drivers in the industry right now. That product is differentiated from our other products. I would say that we continue to believe that it's got a high probability of success. It's priced at Corona, right. So we are not worried necessarily about a cannibalization factor where we would be only worried about the product fundamentally their not being successful, well that's really it. Because otherwise, it's going to be one plus one equals three so there aren't any margin concerns relative to cannibalization. Stephen Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Rob Sands : I guess it's only whether it's additive and successful and that will be determined pretty easily in the test market scenarios. So it's real straightforward low risk stuff. Stephen Powers : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper : Hi guys. Thanks for the question. And there's two. I just wanted to confirm on the comments, so when you are saying that you are able to grow earnings 10%, that's off of the guided basis, $6.55 to $6.65 and that you will be able to exceed $1 billion in free cash flow in 2019? That's my first one. David Klein : Yes. We stand by the targets we put out there in November. Brett Cooper : Okay. Perfect. And then can you guys talk about the retailer receptivity that you -- David Klein : Hang on. The only thing that, when we look at the targets for the individual businesses, you do have to remove Canada but our EPS target remains. Brett Cooper : Okay. Perfect. And then can you talk about retailer receptivity to taking on some of your smaller brands? I mean I guess they are not all that small, but things like Pacifico and Negra, relative to their willingness to do some of the craft brands? And then talk about your expectations for incremental placements in smaller brands and/or packages into the coming year. Rob Sands : Yes. I would say that they are dying for them, especially Pacifico. Brett Cooper : So we should be able to see -- Rob Sands : The only thing that's held us back our Pacifico is not retailer demand. I mean retailers are dying to get the product. Up till now we have been sort of production constrained just trying to feed the growth that we have had, now that we have got Nava up to speed and we will see the addition of another five million hectoliters at Nava in the next few months and we have bought Obregon. That sort of cleared up and now we are beginning to drive those brands like Pacifico. I mean look, I don't want to necessarily predict the future, but Pacifico has got a good chance of being the next Modelo Especial while Modelo Especial still continues to have a huge runway and grow 20%. So I think the good news is, we have got Pacifico coming right behind Modelo Especial with huge retail demand and excitement about the product. I mean there's all kinds of anecdotes about Pacifico and what consumers are thinking relative to the product. I mean probably the most interesting anecdote being that it is the fashionable choice of craft drinkers. Brett Cooper : Perfect. Thank you guys. Rob Sands : Many craft drinkers when they get sick of drinking double IPAs, their beer of choice is Pacifico. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Thank you for being so generous with your time. Just wondering what your people in Mexico are saying about what the Mexican government's reaction might be to Trump-onomics, border taxes, et cetera? Whether there is any risk or opportunity there for you? And then also just given that you have invested in these glass plants, does that put at risk your investments, be it the glass plants or your big production capacity? Would any change in where you source goods lead some of that capacity to be unnecessary? David Klein : So I will answer the second point and then Rob can maybe comment on the Mexican point. But what I would say, Caroline, is that I don't see a scenario where our glass joint venture wouldn't be by far and away the cheapest source of glass even in the new tax regime, just simply because of the freight benefit of having that plant and it's a highly efficient plant sitting next door to our brewery and so about half of our glass needs will ultimately come from that joint venture facility. And I would say that if we needed to move our other packaging sourcing elsewhere, we could do that, given enough time because we are sitting under quite long-term contracts with our packaging vendors. Rob Sands : And I guess my comment on the Mexicans and of course we do talk to the Mexican politicians as well as Pe\u00f1a Nieto, et cetera, et cetera. I think they are taking a measured view of the whole thing. Not necessarily being overly aggressive in their comments about what they will do other than they are prepared to engage in reasonable negotiations. And they do not believe that the U.S., in the end, will enter into or will take actions that would violate WTO principles and other principles of that nature. So I would say, that the Mexicans are being measured in their comments, but on the other hand if pushed they are certainly prepared to say that they will act accordingly if the U.S. violates their agreements. Caroline Levy : Got it. My last question, if you don't mind, would just be to understand the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion in beer? The key drivers, like how much of a role did the peso play? How much of a drag was Ballast? David Klein : Yes. So I don't have the exact components of each of it. But I would say, the first thing is that when we talk about the SG&A re-class last year that gave us a year-over-year comparable benefit on COGS on GP versus the negative hit on the SG&A. And then in the current year, even though the peso has weakened substantially, in the current year we are probably 75% hedged on the peso, right. So that effect is mitigated to a certain extent. And then we just continue to see improvements in overall performance at our Nava facility. So I think it's just the biggest chunk, maybe the year-over-year re-class. And then beyond that, we are just seeing some kind of expected improvements in total GP. Caroline Levy : And just fair to say then that the benefit of the weak peso will continue to be felt next year because of hedging? David Klein : Yes. So we talk about, so we use a three-year hedging program for currency. As I said, we are 70% to 75% hedged on the peso for this fiscal year. Next fiscal year, we usually go into year about 50% of our exposure hedged and then as we roll forward into the 24 and 36 month time horizon, it's lower numbers. So, yes. So assuming that peso stays where it is, we will continue to see benefits coming into our P&L. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well thank you everybody for joining our call today. As we have delivered fantastic results for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we have never been more confident in our future prospects of our business. We look to capitalize on our business' tremendous momentum as we execute our strategy and continue to build shareholder value. Just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, which is scheduled for April, we will be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again, everybody, for joining our call and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each person to two questions during the Q&A session, which will help to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our yearend call. Fiscal 2017 was a very dynamic and rewarding year marked by milestones that produced impressive double-digit growth in sales, EBIT, and operating cash flow. Our path for these impressive results was paved by great execution in growing our core business supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and our operations. I believe it's worth reviewing our achievements as they collectively illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2018. We made a series of value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine and spirits brands. This included our acquisitions of The Prisoner and Charles Smith wine brands as well as High West Distillery, which paved our entrance into the high-end craft whiskey category. Each of these additions boast award-winning products, premium positioning and exceptional, exceptional growth. In fact, these newly acquired brands grew depletions 47%, 67%, and 34% respectively during our fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the recent sale of our Canadian wine business supports our strategy to focus on higher growth, higher margin business initiatives, and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits business. Even after the sale of this business, Canada remains our largest export market as we have had excellent success selling some of our focused brands in the Canadian market, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, and Robert Mondavi. Now these activities were complemented by constellation ventures investments to further explore innovation in brown spirits. They include Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, a producer of premium rye whiskey and gin from organic sources. Bardstown Bourbon, the largest new whiskey distillery in the U.S. and Nelson's Greenbrier distillery, a producer of craft whiskeys. From an operational perspective, we made strategic investments in our beer business to ensure we have the capacity, quality, control, and flexibility to support the exceptional industry-leading growth of our beer business and to meet expected consumer demand for our products well into the future. We recently acquired ABI's brewing operation in Obregon Mexico, which provides an immediate source of supply and functioning brewery capacity for our iconic portfolio of Mexican import brands as well as flexibility for future innovation initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we completed the next phase of expansion at our Nava Brewery in Mexico to reach 25 million hectoliters of capacity ahead of schedule. And earlier this year, we fired up furnace number two at our nearby glass plant which is now producing quality glass at optimal capacity levels. Throughout fiscal 2017, particularly later in the year, we repurchased more than $1 billion worth of outstanding shares during periods when our stock traded at prices that we determined to be good value, and we achieved investment grade debt status for the first time in the company's history. So, to recap, the record operating cash flow that we generated in fiscal 2017 provided significant capital allocation flexibility that enabled a sizable dividend increase, significant share repurchases, value-creating acquisitions, and investments to support the outstanding growth momentum of our business. So, let's move now to a discussion of the excellent business performance our team achieved in fiscal 2017 and some of the initiatives we have underway for the coming year. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market. For the fourth consecutive year in fiscal 2017, Constellation is the number one, the number one growth contributor in the U.S. beer category, outperforming key competitors and all other imports, and Constellation was the leader and number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2016 with our beer business driving almost 100% of import volume growth. Now as we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2018, let's begin our discussion with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been gaining share and is one of just three brands driving the majority of the growth in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. In fiscal 2017, this brand grew depletions about 5% versus the prior year and also achieved status on Interbrand\u2019s Top 100 best global brands list. In fiscal 2018, for the fifth consecutive year, we're planning double-digit increases in our Corona media investments and this has been a key growth driver of the brand with particular focus on live sports, including the NBA, year-round soccer, boxing, and the NFL, which deliver the highest reach against our target consumers. Some of the several major initiatives in place to continue driving Corona Extra's growth, we recently introduced three-pack 24 ounce cans in California and are expanding to additional markets, and we plan to regionally expand Corona Extra draft beyond where it is available today. Corona Extra cans continue to represent a big growth opportunity. So, upcoming plans this year include increased media investments and a new TV advertisement, highlighting a limited edition can. We also expanded our social media support and partnerships to focus on the can format, the on-premise channel and providing enhanced retail tools. Many of these activities are expected to be in full swing as we launch our 120 days of summer campaign beginning with Cinco de Mayo. We recently launched Corona Premier in key test markets, and while it is still too early to call, we are very pleased with the results to date in these markets. We are also in test markets with Corona Familiar 12 ounce bottles. Corona Familiar quarts are already one of the largest packages in the Corona franchise, and so far we are pleased with the early results in the market test. Moving to Casa Modelo. This trio of brands which includes Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Especial Chelada, is one of the biggest forces in beer, delivering more than 14 million cases of growth to the U.S. beer category in calendar 2016. Modelo Especial which is the Casa Modelo flagship brand has achieved double-digit growth for nearly 25 years and has been one of the largest contributors to US beer category growth over the last five years. Ranked number seven nationally in dollars, Modelo Especial is now a top five beer in eight major U.S. markets and the number one, the number one beer in Los Angeles. Last year this brand grew depletions more than 18% to almost 85 million cases. In fiscal 2018, our biggest opportunity for Modelo Especial lies in expanding distribution and enhancing our innovation pipeline and we plan to continue to advertise across the entire Modelo family, including New TV and digital advertising. We also see tremendous opportunity in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial grew almost 25% across draft, bottle and can offerings last year. The draft format alone increased more than 45% making it the fastest growing U.S. draft beer brand and the number one shared on-premise channel in 2016. In fact, in recent syndicated on-premise data, Modelo Especial became the largest volume Mexican draft beer in the entire country. Modelo Especial will have a full lineup of retail programs and consumer promotions delivering execution from Cinco de Mayo to the Christmas holiday in fiscal 2018. Modelo Especial recently became the official and exclusive import beer of the Chicago White Sox. This new marketing partnership offers brand exposure across the White Sox as expansive, marketing assets, digital platforms, arena signage and an all new bar connected with the stadium. In Calendar 2016, Modelo Especial Chelada contributed 95% of Chelada category growth in the U.S. beer market. To capitalize on this trend, Chelada Tamarindo Picante was recently launched becoming the second Chelada flavor to join the Casa Modelo portfolio. In addition, we are launching Chelada three packs to expand our single-serve distribution as well as Modelo Especial 18 packs to allow loyal customers to trade up to larger packages size and hit future price points at retail focused on basket building with larger pack sizes. Now as you're aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, we believe Pacifico has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business. In Calendar 2016, this brand sold five million cases in the State of California alone, not only is Pacifico growing double-digits in California, we have had excellent success with our recent expansion efforts in markets like Seattle and Denver with the addition of TV advertising. Pacifico draft velocities are also strong across the country. As a matter of fact, after eight consecutive years of consistent single-digit growth, Pacifico reached the eight million case mark and achieved depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we are launching the Pacifico 12 ounce can to build on success of the 24-ounce SKU. We are doubling our advertising with two new TV spot in channels like ESPN, TNT and Comedy Central, while also investing in live sports including the NBA, MLB and NFL and let's not forget about Ballast Point, which was the number two-dollar growth contributor in the U.S. craft market this past year adding almost 11% of craft industry volume growth and posting double-digit depletion growth. Throughout the year, Ballast Point beers were awarded more than 40 medals including gold for Grapefruit Sculpin and California Ambers at the U.S. Open Beer Championship. They also won the 2016 Champion Large International Brewery Award for Brewing Excellence at the Australian International Beer Awards. In fiscal 2018, our plan is to continue to expand Ballast Point distribution. We have opportunities to drive continued growth through innovation with brands like Monterey, Monterey Double IPA, Red Velvet Nitro, Bonito Blonde Ale and Sea Rose Tart Cherry Wheat Ale just to name a few. As you would expect, I have assembled every one of these unique beers and I believe they are all winners. We are also planning to increase our Ballast Point sales and marketing investments while leveraging Constellation resources like National Accounts. These initiatives are expected to drive the double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2018 for Ballast Point. We continue to build our East Coast brewery in Belleville Virginia and expect to be brewing there this fall. Overall I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business for fiscal 2018 and as you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business to enhance distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales growth in the 9% to 11% range and operating income growth of 11% to 13%. Now before moving on wine and spirits, I would like to take a minute to discuss, published IRI and Nielsen Consumer Takeaway Data for our beer business, that corresponds with our fourth quarter results as there seems to be significant discussion related to these growth trends. First IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report each quarter. With IRI channels throughout the fourth quarter, we experienced significant variability from week to week, especially in the month of December, which was a challenging month for the entire U.S. beer industry. Much of this relates the year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Christmas and New Year. We also experienced poor weather versus the prior year in the month of February particularly in California which is our largest market. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business and are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth. Given some of the factors I just mentioned, we continue to see an increase in brand relevance and key brands health metrics for our entire portfolio and we are on track to deliver the completion growth of 9% to 10% for the first calendar quarter of 2017. As I mentioned earlier our Nava brewery completed its next expansion phase ahead of schedule and became complete independent from ABI Interim Supply Agreement with the acquisition of the Obregon brewery. The Nava brewery is also ahead of schedule to deliver on the next phase of expansion, which takes the brewery 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year end and we are getting ready to fire up furnace number three in the coming months at our adjacent Nava glass plant. The Obregon brewery continues to integrate systems and processes with the Constellation business and is performing at a very high utilization level. We are developing plans to increase our output from this site and are very pleased with the prospects that this brewery brings to our operational footprint and as mentioned last quarter, we have re-scoped our Mexicali project to initially built 5 million hectoliters of production capacity at a more measured pace as a result of the acquisition of the Obregon brewery. And now I would like to focus on our operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved strong earnings and margin growth for the year. During fiscal 2017, we executed a key strategic -- our key strategies related to premiumization, innovation and brand building. Overall our wine and spirits portfolio gained total channel volume share in Calendar 2016 while delivering exceptional results for our fast-growing higher margin focused brands, which grew depletions about 9% for the year. Many of these focused brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year. Four of our brands were featured on wine.com's top 100 list for calendar 2016, including The Prisoner, Kim Crawford, which emerges the number one Sauvignon Blanc and IRI channels and Meiomi, which is achieved the one million case milestone. Our products also called out in the Beverage Information Group's Awards where four of our brand achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named rising stars and seven were listed as established growth brands including Mark West, Ruffino, Simi and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. From an operational perspective, we improved productivity and created efficiencies through our cost of goods sold optimization initiatives and we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our wine and spirits manufacturing operations. For the year, our spirits portfolio posted excellent net sales growth of 9% driven by High West, Paul Masson and SVEDKA. And from a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2018, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales while improving margin, which is reflected in our fiscal 2018 wine and spirits guidance of 46% sales growth and profit growth in the 5% to 7% range for the year. So what will be the drivers of this goal? We plan to optimize our route to market by evolving our organizational structure to better align with the way we interact with our distributors and our retailers while further developing our account segmentation capabilities to ensure that we are targeting the right products and the right accounts during the right time of the year. Now these changes in our route to market structure provide additional focus on the higher margin, Fine Wine and Spirits part of our business. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the pipeline. This requires us to maintain the discipline we have established with our research and development efforts. It also includes continuing the renovation work we have begun with brands like Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is a great turnaround story. Building on the success of this brand, we have also renovation plans for some of our other brands, including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Clos. We are excited about the innovation brands we recently launched and are planning to launch this coming year including Ravage, Cooper & Thief, Kelly collection, Clos du Bois Lightly Effervescent Chardonnay and Meiomi just to name a few. We plan to aggressively manage our core business and drive acceleration of key focused brands that have scale, growth, momentum and higher margins. This is going to require increased marketing investment to achieve this goal. For example, we are launching a new TV advertising campaign for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is the largest wine brand in our portfolio and we are significantly increasing our digital investments. We also have plans to rationalize our portfolio of hotel brand and have already begun the process of discounting about 15% of our lower margin value brand SKUs in an effort to simplify our portfolio and drive focus on those brands that will drive higher profitability and higher returns and for the fourth consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products within the portfolio. Finally, we are committed to operational effectiveness with an increased focus on safety, service and quality while delivering new capabilities from our technology investments. This also includes an expansion of wine and spirits sourcing initiatives to optimize supply by achieving the right style, quality and margins structure across our brand portfolio and we plan to improve production efficiencies through ongoing footprint consolidation. In closing it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. We've delivered exceptional performance and continued growth momentum and remain one of the best performing companies among our consumer peers. In fact, Constellation drove more dollars sales growth in the next three beverage alcohol companies combined and we constricted 25% of the overall U.S. total beverage alcohol industry growth in calendar 2016. That's why we believe that Constellation provides the best-in-class combination of sustainable topline growth and profitability in the consumer products space. I would like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this past year and our shareholders for their continued support. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein will review our financial results for fiscal 2017 and provide the outlook for fiscal 2018. Thank you. David Klein : Thanks Rob. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal '17 was another exciting year as we continue to generate top-tier growth in the CPG space. Our businesses turned strong marketplace performance into strong financial performance as we generated over 7.3 billion of net sales and 12% net sales growth, expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 140 basis points, increased comparable basis EBIT and diluted EPS 18% and 24% respectively and produced $1.7 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 20%. The strong earnings, operating cash flow growth and divestiture of the Canadian wine business helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.7 times, even as we made capital investments in our Mexican operations, purchased the Obregon brewery, acquired The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West and returned cash to shareholders with $315 million of dividends paid and $1.1 billion in repurchases of stock. We expect fiscal '18 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis EPS and operating cash flow growth, while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by approximately 30%. Let's look at fiscal '17 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results starting with beer. Net sales grew 17%. Organic net sales increased 13% primarily due to volume growth of 11% and favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10.4%. These results were in-line with the enhanced beer guidance we provided at the second quarter. I would like to point out that previously reported beer shipment and depletions volume have been restated for a correction related to the conversion of 7-ounce Coronita cases to 12-ounce 24-pack case equivalents. This restatement had an immaterial impact on previously reported growth rates. We've added historical shipment and depletion information to our segment schedule located in the financial history section of our investor website. Beer operating margin increased 140 basis points to 36.3%. Benefits from pricing and foreign currency were partially offset by marketing investments and consolidation of the Ballast Point business. For wine and spirits, net sales increased 6%. This reflects a 4% increase in organic net sales driven by volume growth and favorable mix and an acquisition benefit from Meiomi and The Prisoner. Total U.S. depletions grew 3% for the year while our focus brand portfolio posted 9% depletion growth. Wine and spirits' operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.8%. Benefits primarily from the addition of Meiomi and The Prisoner along with favorable mix were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing. Interest expense for the year increased 6% to $333 million as higher average borrowing rates were partially offset by lower average interest rates. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of February totaled $9.1 billion an increase of $1.1 billion since the end of fiscal '16. This activity primarily reflects the funding for The Prisoner, Charles Smith, High West and Obregon acquisitions as well as our stock repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 26.8% versus 29.6% last year. This reflects a benefit of the APB 23 Accounting on part of our current year foreign earnings. As a reminder, during Q3 fiscal '17, we determined that a portion of our foreign earnings would be indefinitely reinvested. This assertion allows the company to record income taxes on certain foreign earnings using the applicable foreign jurisdiction tax rates rather than the higher U.S. tax rate. Now let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at a $1.48 per share up 24%. Organic beer net sales increased 10% due to volume growth of 9% and favorable pricing. Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 38%. This increase was primarily driven by foreign currency as the benefits from pricing was essentially offset by higher depreciation. Wine and spirits' organic net sales increased 4% mostly due to volume growth. Wine and spirits' operating margin increased to 160 basis points to 26.6%. Benefits from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the acquisition of The Prisoner and Charles Smith were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing. Moving to Fiscal '17 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $789 million compared to $522 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion up 20% primarily driven by our earnings growth and CapEx totaled $907 million, which was slightly above last year spent. Moving to our full year fiscal '18 P&L and free cash flow outlook, for fiscal '18 we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $8 per share. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 16% growth. Our beer business is targeting net sales growth in the range of 9% to 11% and operating income growth in the range of 11% to 13%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit from our Mexican portfolio. We're pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '17 a little over 36%, which was a little above the high-end of our most recent guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by FX favorability that I discussed earlier. Our fiscal '18 beer segment guidance had us targeting operating margin expansion for the year. In fiscal '18, we expect to see positive growth margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency, glass sourcing initiatives and supply independence from ABI. These benefits will be partially offset by our ramp up in depreciation as we continue to bring assets online and optimize new capacity. Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $115 million in fiscal '17. We expect that to increase by approximately 50% in fiscal '18. We also fiscal '18 SG&A and marketing spend rate as a percentage of sales to be similar to fiscal '17. For the wine and spirits business for fiscal '18, we expect reported net sales to decrease in the range of 46% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the estimated negative impact of the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions. As outlined in our press release, for fiscal '17 through the mid-December divestiture date, net sales and operating income that will no longer be part of our wine and spirits segment as a result of the sale of the Canadian wine business, totaled $311 million and $50 million respectively. When excluding these amounts from our fiscal '17 wine and spirits results, we expect net sales growth of 46% and operating income growth 5% to 7% as our premiumization activities continue to drive operating margin expansion. In addition, we expect our tax rate to approximate 22%. The decrease versus the fiscal '17 tax rate reflects additional anticipated foreign tax rate benefits through the APB 23 assertion on a larger portion of our foreign earnings and an anticipated benefit from a new accounting standard related to stock-based payment awards, which Constellation will adopt starting in fiscal '18. Let me spend a few minutes on this. In fiscal '17 in prior years, accounting standards required excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards to be recognized in equity and the cash benefit to be reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement. The new standard now requires this benefit to be recognized as a reduction of tax expense in the income statement and presented in the operating section of the cash flow statement. Our tax rate guidance includes an estimated 3% benefit related to the adoption of this new standard. This benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result of this, we expect much more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and a quarterly basis. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at $201 million. This does not assume additional share repurchases. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion. This includes approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. Fiscal '18 should represent the peak spending year for these activities. In closing, we believe we have the right strategies in place to capture the growth opportunities in beverage alcohol over the long-term. Our impressive fiscal '17 results and our business initiatives and financial goals for fiscal '18, demonstrate our focus on generating sustainable growth and top-tier financial performance in the CPG space as part of our efforts to increase shareholder value. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey good morning, guys. Rob Sands : Hey Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, Rob on the beer volume front, you continue to perform very well from a growth standpoint and obviously from a market share standpoint within the industry. It's not much of a change versus the larger brewers, but we have seen more recently a large slowdown in the craft segment and getting more fair share of merchandising and distribution has already been a focus for you guys in terms of your beer portfolio. So in light of those factors, I was just hoping you could review for us, the rated distribution expansion you're expecting in fiscal 2018? Should we expect an acceleration versus recent trend, and then secondly, also on the beer volume front now that you have more capacity in place, are there any big opportunities across your brand portfolio or on the innovation front that you're now pursuing more aggressively as a result of the capacity growth, thanks? Rob Sands : So yeah, we are expecting to increase the pace of distribution growth across our beer portfolio. In fact, we expect roughly 70% of our growth in beer next year Dara to come from distribution growth. So, this is really the key variable in achieving our results and with the momentum behind our portfolio and the nature of our portfolio entirely on the high end and really being one of the most important profit drivers at wholesale and at retail, okay, we expect that we will achieve our distribution growth goals and therefore our overall growth goals. Now to your next question about production capacity and innovation, the answer to your question is 100% totally. We are well set up now to really drive, number one, parts of the business that we haven't been driving really because we were concerned while we were under the interim supply agreement and we didn't have necessarily the capacity in place to start driving business that we were uncertain that we could supply. So certainly in terms of existing brands, other brands in the portfolio like Pacifico where we're really starting to make a push to driving that to be one of the key growth providers in the portfolio is an example and then clearly our NPD in beer, which we\u2019ve recently launched right, Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar product are examples of NPD that we weren\u2019t in a position to do up until now, but now we are extremely well positioned with two big breweries Nava and Obregon fully on stream as well as a third brewery well underway. So, we're very optimistic about what both we can do now with yet another brand that we think is going to be a big growth driver of Pacifico and what we can do with NPD, and the business which appears to be very successful at least in test markets thus far. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful and then David on the beer margin side, the expansion of 60 basis points implied by the midpoint of the initial fiscal '18 guidance, it still seems conservative despite the depreciation increase when you consider the historical expansion and all the positive factors you mentioned like the glass savings pricing, topline leverage moving off ISI etcetera. So, it seems like those positive factors would overwhelm significantly the depreciation increase. So are there other prohibitive factors limiting the margin upside as you look to next year beyond the depreciation or are you just being conservative this early in the year. David Klein : I think of our $2 billion of COGS and beer, there are just a lot of moving parts, things that swing your way things that move in the other direction. I want to just make clear that our guidance implies a peso rate of about 20 pesos to the dollar right, and we know that's running a little bit less than that. It's in the high 18s as we sit here today. So, you I think it's -- I think we're suggesting continued margin expansion, but I think we're just being prudent at this point in the year. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hi Judy. Judy Hong : Hi. So, I guess just going back to the beer volume, certainly the Nielsen IRI could be very pretty volatile, but it looks like your depletion growth has also been pretty volatile in the last few months. Cagney had talked about 8% depletion for the fourth quarter. You came in at 6.2%, which implies obviously a pretty big slowdown in February and then March looks like it's got better. So just a little bit of color just in terms of what's going on, obviously, the broader industry has been pretty soft, but certainly the weather is having an impact, but any color just in terms of the cadence of your depletion growth and then what you've seen so far from a March perspective would be great. Rob Sands : So yes, Judy, as it relates to our fourth quarter performance, I would say that February ended up a little softer than we had expected at the time, and I think there's a danger in watching the week-to-week or even month-to-month depletions. I think if you look at our overall trends in the business, we continue to gain share in the business at about the same rate as we have been over the last 12 to 24 months. Clearly total beverage alcohol has slowed down a little bit over the past 12 months, but that seems to be mirroring what's happening in the broader CPG category as well. So, we feel pretty confident to be sitting here in early April and putting out I think some pretty strong guidance for our fiscal '18. So, despite the volatility that we're seeing, we're pretty confident in our ability to deliver these numbers. David Klein : And I guess I'll just add Judy that what's becoming I think obviously to everyone is that in the short term, sort of as a result of where holidays fall, the number of sell days in a particular month etcetera, there's a lot of fluctuation in the short-term that can affect short-term volume, whether you're talking depletions or otherwise. And I would encourage everybody to sort of focus on stacked results as opposed to focusing on these very short-term numbers, which there is a lot of volatility associated with those short-term numbers and you can see it in December numbers, which were across the industry not very good okay and is driving a lot of the slowdown. And in December basically what you had were holidays falling on weekend and instead of the middle of the week. So instead of people drinking twice during the week, they were only drinking once during the week on the weekend. Okay, this really affect things. In March okay and April, you're going to see a shift which by the way I think this will affect wine and spirits more than it will beer, you're going to see a shift of Easter into April this year, right, mid-April this year from March last year. So that's really going to affect the numbers that you're going to be looking at on a short-term basis and this is especially in wine and spirits because there tends to be more of a wine and spirits drinking holiday than a beer drinking holiday, but I think you have to look at those stack results now. In our case right, fourth quarter yet depletions in beer looked a little lackluster and then you look at first quarter of the calendar year and I would say everything basically bounced right back to be very consistent with the growth that we're expecting throughout the remainder of the year and we see nothing at all right now that would suggest to us that just on a general proposition whether it's across -- whether it's beer or wine or spirits, maybe talk about the industry as a whole, I think that we're fairly confident that you'll see things reverse to the mean as it relates to industry growth across TBA and I think on our own growth, we see nothing inhibiting us from achieving our guidance across the wine, beer and spirits portfolio, which I think will be very strong continued results. Judy Hong : Okay. Got it. And then secondly, just on beer pricing outlook, so I think you're sticking to the 1% to 2% pricing for 2018. There is obviously been some pricing permission in the high end within Ultra. How do you think about your ability to get to that 1% to 2% pricing? Have you taken some of that pricing already in some of your markets and sort of your comfort level on that front? Rob Sands : Sort of a same story. We see no innovation or issues in achieving our pricing guidance. You point out every quarter and basically every year we're talking about some skirmish that has occurred especially in beer the constitutes some tea leaf reading, right. So whether it's low prices on Mic Ultra, somewhere for some reason or whether last year it was the giving away of goose CAGS in the Northwest, there is countless -- there is countless examples of this stuff all the time, but fundamentally speaking we don't see pricing in the beer market portending anything other than that guidance that we had given and what we expect which is 1% to 2% pricing, which really will take very strategically market by market, brand by brand and again we're confident that we'll achieve that goal. David Klein : And Judy you know that pricing in beer for the most part is taken in the fourth calendar quarter of the year right. So, the pricing that -- the preponderance of the pricing that we're counting on to achieve our guidance is already in the market. Judy Hong : Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital. Nik Modi : Yes. Good morning, everyone. A couple collections, just first David on the guidance on the peso, is that inclusive of hedges, just wanted to clear that up? And then the broader question is so certainly CPD volumes across all industries have slowed lately and I'm just curious you guys are in kind of a unique position because you're gaining so much market share, but I am just curious on your overall take on what you see with the consumer. I understand the timing of calendar and holidays and things like that, but it looks like something else is going on, I would be curious to your thoughts. David Klein : So, Nik, I'll take the peso question and then Rob can respond on the market, so we're just saying that we're targeting in our guidance around the 20 pesos to the dollar. That includes our hedge program that's already in place and I would say that we're probably about 50% hedged on the peso. Nik Modi : Got it. Rob Sands : So, Nik, on the consumer side, I think that we definitely saw some softening in consumer confidence in the fourth quarter and efforts of that are highly speculative, but I would say it's certainly around a lot of the political uncertainty and what has transpired across a lot of areas in that regard. On the other hand, as we move now past the first quarter right, we're seeing some signs of increased consumer confidence, the jobs number, which came out very recently was higher than expected and by the way, we track things like the correlation of various statistics like job growth, like GDP against our beer performance over long periods and I think a good example of that job growth tends to be a positive for our business and is GDP by the way tend to be a positive for our business. So, as we see some of these things improve, I think that you're going to see consumer confidence improve, but you only have to sit around and watch the news to understand that there will continue to be a lot of political uncertainty for the next I guess nobody can, the next is uncertain. The next period of time. Or I think you can say that we are totally uncertain about how long there will be political uncertainty. Nik Modi : Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hey Vivien. David Klein : Hi Vivien. Vivien Azer : So, Rob, I really appreciate your commentary on a bunch of the transitory factors that are impacting both your results and Nielson as well as the more constructive commentary on some of the March data. As we kind of look back on fiscal 4Q, is there any way to quantify any of that just opposing California where the weather was really bad relative to your national trends. Anything to help us understand the magnitude of some of that option. Rob Sands : It's all about December right. December was a weird month. If December had been normal, the results would have been normal. That's basically the quantification of everything. So yeah, I told you and I'm sure you're already aware about the holidays and how they fell in December versus the previous year. You brought up the weather, I didn't. I don't like to talk about the weather because the one thing that we know for sure is that there's always going to be weather okay and we're in the very fortunate position of not having necessarily to reverse to the weather okay as our excuse for everything. So really, I think it falls back to December and you could basically normalize December and you would've ended up with normalized results. As things have thus proved themselves to be the case, following December and looking at the first calendar quarters. And then the December thing was across wine beer and spirits. So, I think as it related to our portfolio in particular we've given our guidance and we're confident on our guidance for the year of 2018. So, I think that that's really where the proof is right. It's in the guidance and looking at the first calendar quarter on beer. And the IRI to some degree as well which has only constituted 50% of the business, but it remains a fairly decent indicator and IRI looks good. Vivien Azer : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Rob Sands : Hi Pablo. Pablo Zuanic : Hi. Look just two big question, one, can I just only drill a little bit deeper on the state of the consumer, particularly your Hispanic consumer, you say that that represents about 40% of U.S. sales. Just give us any color you have there. Obviously, you have better pulse of the consumer and most bigger companies giving your exposure there, that would be helpful. I understand you're touching the political situation, but just expand on that. And the second question in terms of your relationship, if I just briefly on the relationship with the wholesalers, obviously, distributers they are the gold network, must be very happy with your performance right, you're driving the industry growth, you made good profit margin. But here you are bringing more SKUs to them.  You said 70% of your growth is going to come from distribution. You're also bringing balance to them. Is that straining in any way the relationship with the distributors especially when you're counting on distribution being such a big distribution expansion being such a big driver of your growth. Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes. So, I'll take both questions. I think that as it relates to consumer confidence, as you said drilling down on that, if you look in the fourth quarter in particular I do think that we saw a disproportionate negative impact on Hispanic consumer confidence and that's for all of the obvious reasons I think, which is related to all the very unfortunate rhetoric with regard to Mexico coming out of the Trump administration and the news. Now that said, I would say that the Trump factor has diminished somewhat and therefore consumer confidence among Hispanics has probably increased a bit with all of the latest rhetoric, which is I wasn\u2019t able to get ACA repeal and replace through that's brought a lot of uncertainty around what they are or are not going to be able to do relative to tax reform. I'm sure you saw the comments from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kelly over the last two or three days basically saying that there isn\u2019t going to be a wall built that will stretch from border to border. Maybe they\u2019ll put up a couple of fences and this and that, but they\u2019ve completely backed off or at least Trump's cabinet has backed off of the long rhetoric which I don't think that the wall is one of the big factors that we're particularly concerned about but it is a concern to our Hispanic consumers and does relate to the consumer confidence. So, I think on the Hispanic front, especially Mexican Hispanic, I think the fourth quarter things were a bit disproportionately poor, but I think that it's improving because as things continue to move forward it becomes more obvious to everybody that a lot of this stuff is rhetoric and sort of business as usual in Washington as it relates to elections and election promises versus whatever -- what actually happened. So many do have the actual hard statistics like jobs being better than anticipated in the recent jobs report. So that my commentary on that. And then your second question was on yes, relationship with wholesalers, now relationship with wholesalers is not being strained in any way, shape or form. Our relationship with our wholesalers on the beer side couldn\u2019t be better. In fact, we are 100% of their growth okay, but Constellation okay, their businesses would be going backwards and their profits would be going backwards. Where their growth driver and in many instances today, we are their largest profit contributor period. As you know, we're largely or at least the majority of our distributors are Miller Coors houses and many of the major ones we moved ahead of Miller Coors in terms of profit contribution and as I said, we're providing the growth. They're very excited about new high-end products from us and in fact dying for it is the truth of the matter. And then you take a look at a product like Ballast Point, our distributors have not given up in any way, shape or form on the craft strategy, on the craft category. I would say that they are beginning and I think this is a good thing not a bad thing, just like the retailer to take a more measured approach to it and realizing that it doesn't make sense for them to carry every SKU under the sun and that they have to pair down in that regard. But clearly as business people both at retail and at wholesale, what they're thinking is we're going to pare down to the brands that are supported from an execution, from merchandising, from an advertising perspective by companies that have the wherewithal to invest behind these brands and they're basically going to get rid of all this no-name stuff that they know that is fly-by-night and the company is behind them don't have the wherewithal to support the brand. So, I think that shake out is going to work greatly to our favor and then I think with -- they see that we're bringing resources to this that the other competitive brands can't necessarily bring to the party. Some can. Some can't. And when I say resources, it's resources like our national accounts connections, team, hey just -- it's our wholesalers, right, it's a virtuous circle. We bring to them the products that are driving all of their growth, they turn around and focus on the products that are driving all of their growth, which causes those products do better than the other products. So, I think that Ballast Point bodes well with and then the positioning of Ballast Point right, the premiumization of it right, this is just, this is exactly what the beer guys are looking for are true premium, high margin beer products and that's both our wholesalers and our retailers. So, I believe they think that it's an exciting proposition and they will continue to drive that business. Pablo Zuanic : All right. Thanks. That's very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions, one for you David and a broader question for you Rob, but there was an impairment charge David of $37.6 million in the quarter. So, what was that for? And then Rob if you think about your wine and spirits business, which is performing well and better than it did historically, you have a little bit bigger business in spirit. I'm wondering if that's aiding distribution for your wine brands and if you can give us an update on your appetite for additional spirits bolt-on and then on the wine component of your business, how would you characterize the promotional environment generally and your ability to deal with promotion against your brands from competitors and why David Klein : So, Mark on the impairments, that's really just a continuation of our premiumization strategy. So, we had some wines in particular mostly sub $5 labels. We didn't sell a lot of cases of brands like Tallas or Marcus James that we elected to discontinue in order to shrink the number of brands in our portfolio and drive the premiumization trend. So that was just good housekeeping I would say, from a skew management perspective. Mark Swartzberg : Fair enough. Great. Rob Sands : So, Mark, to your questions, one spirits distribution and how that relates to wine, I would say it's separate largely and they were not. There is no strategy here to use spirits distribution to somehow drive wine distribution. In fact, we created a separate spirit salesforce to give more focus to our spirits business because yes, we think that that's a great both growth and margin driver in the future for us, but our early trends use spirits drive wine distribution or necessarily vice versa, except to the extent that we do have a TBA approach and when we are dealing with our major retail customers particularly the chains and mass merchandisers and clubs right where business is gravitating and we're talking to the people who alcoholic beverage roles up to, which there is usually an alcoholic beverage person, we're certainly taking advantage of the fact that across TBA, total beverage alcohol, we're providing all their growth or a large percentage of their growth and we're providing more profit to them largely than anybody else in the industry. So this is how we take advantage of our position across beer, wine and spirits with our major customers in that TBA continues to be the most important category in all of retail and especially with the big chains clubs and mass merchandise where that business is also gravitating to is the best profit provider, if you look at their top categories, which are CSR, carbonated software and CRDs and tobacco and alcoholic beverages right, well alcoholic beverages is really their stand out in terms of growth and profitability and dairy right is another category. These are all largely declining, highly commoditized categories versus beverage alcohol. So, we do use our TBA position to drive distribution, but as it relates to wine and spirits not really, but the big opportunity does exists for us with spirits and our spirits portfolio we intend to drive that. And yeah if we see any tuck-in acquisitions for spirit that we make sense, within our disciplines right, we haven\u2019t put aside any element of our financial discipline on anything that we do nor are we going to. Okay. So, we will be selective if tuck-in opportunities. We're not going to -- our financial discipline on some theoretical basis tied around strategy and that isn\u2019t quantifiable into our financial discipline. So, you can fundamentally count on that. And then you talked about promo, which\u2026 Mark Swartzberg : Can I just interject real quick on the promo just to put that aside for a quick moment, with the cash flow profile of the business being what it is and the dividend increase and the repo you completed over the last fiscal year, I would think that if I'm in your shoes, the ability to pick up the pace of bolt-ons whether they're in spirits or wine or segments of beer is picking up right. So that what's driving my question still focused on spirits, but am I right to think that your attitude to pick up the pace is picking up because of the nature of the cash flow situation? Rob Sands : That's an interesting question and my answer is that in terms of our capital deployment strategy okay, it probably hasn't changed or I should say and have chanced okay, as we continue to see our cash flow generation build, we are going to strike the same kind of balance that we have struck between paying down debt and keeping debt levels within our target of the mid three's okay. We will also continue to focus on returning value and dollars to shareholders, whether it's through things like our dividend increases or more stock repurchases okay to offset the normal dilution that occurs in our business annually and tuck-in acquisition. So, I don't see much changing with regard to any of those three things and we will continue to balance it and then on the tuck-in acquisitions specifically to your question about spirits, that's more a function of deal flow right, like what good things are there out there that will become available that meet our financial discipline like that's a very unclear -- there is no clear answer to that question. So, if the deal, if all of a sudden lot of things became available, again balancing those three things, the debt flow, our ability to offset dilution and return money to the shareholders proving back stock, we will look at all of the good deals that are strategic for us, both financially and otherwise in the portfolio as they come along. And I say strategic for us, what do I mean by that? Well that's our financial discipline as number one and then number two right, it's got to be high margin, high growth okay. We're not interested in much anything else, but that is in high margin, high growth okay where we wouldn't just do a financial deal on something that was something that did fit into the portfolio and what we're trying to do with the overall business and portfolio. So, it's got to be in a category to be high margin and high growth. There is large categories in beverage alcohol. There is insignificant to favor at the current time and we're probably not going to go there nor are we necessarily going to chase the absolute latest and greatest at any moment in time on the other side of that. So, it's all a big balance. Mark Swartzberg : Very, very helpful and on wine, I was just -- the short version, the promotional environment, how would you characterize it as what you're seeing vis-\u00e0-vis your portfolio or what you're looking at into the coming fiscal year? Rob Sands : Well when you think about promotion because there is so much promotional activity in wine, I think that we tend to think more about it in terms of net price realization whether it's through promo or frontline pricing. I would say that in terms of net price realization, wine is some robust than it has been in the past meaning in very simple terms whether it's through reduced promotion or for better frontline pricing, there's a little bit more pricing power and pricing, positive pricing activity, increased pricing in wine than there has been in the past. And I think that even in our portfolio, we're probably this year planning on taking more pricing than we have even in previous years. So, I would say that's getting to be a fairly robust environment. Everybody is sort of realizing that often the difference between a great business, a good business and a bad business is around how much pricing power there is in the marketplace. And wine continued to preimmunize at a very fast rate and with the premiumization and focus becoming now more around wines priced between $15 and $25 as opposed to be between $5 and $10 right, the price sensitivity on all this stuff is somewhat diminishing right because if you're looking at a bottle of Meiomi or other products that are now getting to be in the sweet spot of the commercial part of the business all of a sudden $0.49 is critical as if you were talking about a $5.99 $7.50 or $0.99 is a gigantic percentage. So, I think a positive news. Mark Swartzberg : Great. Thank you, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Thank you. And congrats on the results. So, I would like to go back to beer, it sounds impossible, your beer gross margins expanded nicely to all-time highs of 52% and you also you also had an EBIT margin that grew nicely. So, you're probably driven by this new capacity and the end of the supply agreement, but would you expect us to see more reinvestment in SG&A as you alluded to in the prepared remarks across beer and wine as well and your guidance for the whole company actually implies some of the investment, but I also like margin, gross margin expansion and it's likely EBIT expansion. So how should we think of the balance of gross margin, operating margins going forward, especially as you have tougher competitors into the year and related to this if you can expand on the beer utilization I know you probably also have some higher fixed cost. So, do you expect any volatility as we see going through the quarters? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes. So just thinking about margins kind of at the EBIT margin level Andrea, we do believe that will have some benefits during the years, as I said earlier from FX and some benefits of -- some benefits of coming off of the ISA and in glass sourcing and so forth, offset by depreciation and one-time line commissioning cost because there is still going to be some noise in our COGS as we bring more capacity online. I think so you're going to see a little expansion there. I would say that from an SG&A and marketing perspective, you can assume that that's a percentage of sales, that will remain consistent year-over-year. I will say however considering a lot of other consumer products companies talking about the work that they're doing to take cost out of their business, we're doing all of that same work with a view of being able to redeploy resources to initiatives that are going to continue to drive the topline growth of our business. So, we are getting some benefits on the SG&A and marketing line, but the benefit is really more effectiveness and more, more topline growth as a result of that work. And then from a capacity utilization standpoint, I would say that we're going to be flat out at Obregon and Nava, as we go through the summer selling season. So, I don't expect that we'll see fluctuations in our cost as a result of utilization issues on overhead and in fact our ops guys are really good, but I don't think we'll see I don't think we'll see a lot of spare utilization that they have to try to manage for a couple years yet. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. Thank you. And then for any spirits if I can just add my second question on how -- what are you seeing there because we didn't have a chance to discuss and so organically we're seeing the continuous trends on that category? Rob Sands : Yes. So, we're continuing to see strong growth in the categories that we're playing in spirits right. So, our brand spirit Tequila continue to do well. Our brand in particular continue to do well and the recent IRI High West is up 79%. So, we're seeing good trends in the spirits business as I said in particular in the place where our newest brands like Casa Noble and High West play. Andrea Teixeira : All right. Thanks David. Thanks Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. A couple questions, so in the fourth quarter there was a little bit less than a 300-basis point difference between the depletions and the shipments, what does that mean for the first quarter and maybe you talk a little bit about where inventory levels are and what we should expect between shipments and depletions in Q1? Rob Sands : Yes. So, we don't necessarily manage quarter ends all that tightly in beer because the inventory turns pretty quickly. We keep around 30 days of inventory on hand at our distributor on average across the portfolio and we're roughly in line with that at yearend maybe we're up a little bit, but that's to be expected going into this summer selling season. So, we're right where we want to be and we don't -- we're not purposely building inventory at distributors, again we like that 30-day mark. Rob Ottenstein : Terrific and then could you talk a little bit about Obregon in terms of its impact in the quarter and in the following year in terms on the income statement and your margins? Is it having a positive impact, negative impact, how should we think about it? Rob Sands : I would say that Obregon's probably it's thin line, it's not accretive or dilutive to our margins. We get some benefit of being off the ISA. We get some mile freight benefits, but to the West Coast shipments, but it's a more costly facility in general to produce in for a whole bunch of reasons, which we're going to try to address over time. So, I would say in the near term it's about a wash. Rob Ottenstein : But it sounds like you have a pathway to actually make it accretive over time. Rob Sands : I think what you'll see over time is you'll see us, yeah, yeah, right and then what we're really looking forward to the date when we actually have three facilities functioning and we can optimize our production runs through those facilities to really try to drive the best possible margins. But at this point we're producing and selling all the beer that we can get out -- we're selling all the beer that we can get out of our production facilities. Rob Ottenstein : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the strong quarter. The first one is very quick, its confirmation on tax. You guided 22% tax rate for the fiscal '18, is that the new run rate. I understand there will be more volatility here or is it just for full year '18. That's for your David. David Klein : Good question, Laurent because we talked about mid-20s at our Investor Meeting and I would say that the 22% is a bit of a refinement. So, we would expect that we go forward in that 22 to 25. So, it's kind of the low-end of mid-20s. But keeping in mind the point that you made, there will be more volatility because of stock-based comp. Laurent Grandet : Okay. Thank you. And my second question really is more for your Rob, you mentioned 70% of the gross would be coming from distribution in the beer segment. Can I have a bit more granularity on this, what would be coming from Corona Can and Modelo versus what would be coming from brands like Pacifico or Ballast and then what's the balance of this 30% shelf space, you're gaining from this year or is it something else, thank you. Rob Sands : Sure. So probably the biggest opportunity for growth is in Modelo Especial where there is a lot of room for distribution growth to get a brand like that up to say the same distribution levels as Corona Extra. So, the focus will be on building Modelo Especial distribution. And then Corona cans is another huge opportunity for distribution growth as well as, as I said some of the other products like Pacifico and then Ballast Point is hardly -- hardly has distribution outside of California. So, there's a big opportunity to drive the growth in Ballast Point through targeted distribution in other states. So, bottom line is sort of across the portfolio with probably the exception of Corona Glass 12 packs, there's a lot of -- there's just a lot of distribution growth opportunity and distribution growth is the primary way to drive volume growth. Laurent Grandet : And then about the balance of the 30%, is it shelf space you're gaining from light on economy or is it something else? Rob Sands : That would be velocity. It increases in velocity on brands that are getting distribution and becoming more popular. So, you'll see both happen. David Klein : Yes, and a lot of that when we do our regression analysis around a lot of that comes from incremental, or more effective media spend as well as some of -- some demographic and economic tailwinds. Laurent Grandet : Okay. Well, thank you very much Rob and David, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. I guess officially, good afternoon. Just two quick questions. One, you said on Corona that we just finished the fifth year of double-digit increases on advertising and marketing. Will we have a six-year or are we starting to get to the equilibrium or have it where you want to be in terms of behind that brand? David Klein : We continue to get outstanding returns on investment from marketing spend on Corona and so we'll continue to drive that brand and in the context of our total SG&A remaining constant as a percent of net sales, I just want to be clear that we're going to continue to look for ways to be more efficient with our spend across that whole SG&A spectrum so that we have money to invest in brand growth. Bill Chappell : Okay. So, it implies double-digit for the portfolio while G&A gets maybe more efficient. David Klein : Right in aggregate and if you look at our beer business and our beer business guidance has this double digits, it implies everything else stays the same, we'll be getting that kind of growth in our marketing spend. Bill Chappell : Okay. And then one other, I might have missed this but the outlook on great cost this year and what impact it's having on margins? David Klein : I think that that we expect great cost to continue to be very stable and we're not anticipating any material impact on margin. That said, you just don't know right now because until you get to the point where terms can be measured and even that's fairly unreliable because there is a lot of weather that can occur between even then and harvest you don't know what the size of the harvest is going to be, which is what tends of affect great pricing. But we're not expecting anything unusual. I would doubt very seriously that we're going to see anything out of the ordinary on great pricing and therefore its impact on margins this year. So, I would say it's something to particularly focus on. Bill Chappell : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. Rob, I know you don't like to talk about weather but there are three influences here coming up for some of the forecast for Cinco de Mayo as 81 and Sacramento, so that looks good, but it's been really rainy for about break probably difficult to get machines into the field and that's a negative and then groundwater and reservoir levels are good and so that's a positive. Is there any takeaway there? You just had touched on that a second ago, but thoughts. Rob Sands : Tim, you're not really supposed to use specialized wine knowledge on these conference calls. Tim Ramey : Yes sir. Rob Sands : But the answer really continues to be no different than what I think you're going to see different -- you're going to see different things happen in different regions and obviously, business and where we source grapes from is so diversified that we're going to see some ups and downs. It could be tight in Napa. You take a brand like just high-end peanut brand Meiomi we're sourcing, the great thing about Meiomi right, it's a three Appalachian brand meaning it comes from three different Appalachian which gives us a lot of flexibility with regard to the sourcing of those grapes and then obviously, we're continuing to source a lot of grapes from the Northern Central Valley from the central moderate. So, I think you're going to see some balancing there meaning you'll see some tightknit in some areas and you'll see some of the opposite in other areas and obviously also in the Pacific Northwest that's also important to us now as well as the brand like Charles West and Charles Smith, which is growing really high double-digits. And therefore, we're using a lot of the Washington supply right now, which was part of that deal, which we locked up, a lot of the Washington supply of premium wine grapes with the Charles Smith deal, which was one of the reasons that we thought it was a good deal and it's turning out to be a particularly good deal with Kung Fu Girl Riesling making capital 100 in the wine spectator and that kind of stuff really drives the growth of brands like that. Tim Ramey : Okay. David, just two quick ones, any single point estimate on DNA for the total company for 2018 and then also on the new share compensation standard that increases shares outstanding slightly I believe and your share count forecast was a little higher than what I thought it would be. Can you quantify what that would be? David Klein : Yes, so our share count estimate is really our best estimate as we sit here today right. So, it's inclusive of all of those points. And then Tim as it relates to depreciation and amortization I would say, you can think about the rest of the business as being fairly consistent, but we said that in the beer business that that number would be up about 50% year-over-year. So that's really the only change. Tim Ramey : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS. Stephen Powers : Hey great. Just two quick one\u2019s for you David. First just around the beer margin discussion, is there any way you can help better dimension the benefits you've seen with Glass Furnish Two coming online at Nava and what you expect for Glass Furnace Three and Four as you look forward? David Klein : It's kind of hard to do in a real simple way right because as I said on $2 billion a COGS and mid $4 billion of sales and we can have $10 million, $15 million swing $20 million swings in both directions over a number of items. And so, there's definitely a benefit for bringing on furnace two and three and ultimately furnace four, but I think it really gets kind of absorbed into the overall margin numbers over time, because we're really talking about $15 million swings as opposed to $70 million when you bring up the furnace. You can't see those if you look at our NCI charge, on a year-over-year basis, we expect that number to double on a full-year basis to about $10 million and that just represents incremental profitability in our glass joint venture. Stephen Powers : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then finally on CapEx with the billion you're assuming for beer this is in fiscal '18 I believe that leaves $500 million to $600 million remaining across '19 and '20 this is what you said previously. Just want to confirm that's still the three-year aggregate assumption? And then as I think about that incremental call it $500 million to $600 million, should I -- should we consider that to be more or less evenly split across '19, '20, or is it going to be frontloaded loaded or is it too early to tell. David Klein : So, the numbers that you quoted are roughly right. What I would say is that when we talk about a billion first of all, there's a range in that billion we just repaid. We picked kind of a point in there and I would say that that isn't all -- that's our entire beer capital number right, it's not necessarily all build out. So, the number over the next couple years is probably a little bit higher than the $600 you quoted I think, but it's not going to be material in the grand scheme of things. Stephen Powers : Okay. That's fair enough, just wanted to clarify. Thank you. Operator : And that was our final question. I'll now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well thanks everyone for joining today's call. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with the excellent performance across all of our businesses. Our fiscal 2018 guidance shows we're very confident in our abilities to sustain profitable growth and we are firm in our commitment to build shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter for our new fiscal year. Before then we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your Spring celebrations including Cinco and Memorial Day weekend and of course enjoy them responsibily and speaking of Cinco, look for us at the New York Stock Exchange and on May 05 as we officially kick off our summer selling season by ringing the closing bell. Thanks, everybody and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am Patty Yahn-Urlaub from Investor Relations and I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.  Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, one versus two prior, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. Our quarterly results reflect the continuation of our winning streak, as we produced results that delivered our 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth. I\u2019m also pleased to report that this morning we achieved a new all-time high stock price while significantly outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year. So let\u2019s get underway with a review of the business performance that delivered these fantastic results. We\u2019ll start with Constellation's beer business, which remained the number one growth driver in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, driving 60% of the growth of this market segment, while posting double-digit depletions and significantly improving margins.  Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays drove significant market share gains for the quarter. As a matter of fact, Constellation claimed 5 of the top 15 high-end share gainer spots during Cinco de Mayo with Modelo Especial coming in as a number one growth driver followed by Corona Extra in the number three spot and Pacifico rounding out the top five. During this quarter we increased media investments for Corona Extra and launched New English and Spanish language National TV campaigns including a new TV advertisement highlighting limited edition can packaging. Casa Modelo\u2019s flagship Modelo Especial brand is on fire, gaining distribution while delivering depletion growth of almost 20% for the first quarter. Also under the Casa Modelo Umbrella, we launched the new Modelo Chelada flavor, Tamarindo Picante which is supported with a fully integrated marketing and merchandising plan, as well as Modelo Chelada three packs both of which saw strong sales in the quarter. We expanded our national TV advertising efforts during the first quarter for the Pacifico brand, which posted depletion growth of 20%, representing an acceleration from where we ended fiscal 2017. And our new product entrance into the marketplace including Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar are showing strong performance in markets where they are currently available with velocities and consumer acceptance exceeding our expectations.  Thanks to the great effort to the beer team, I am pleased to announce that Constellation recently tied for the top ranked supplier in the latest Tamarron Malt Beverage Supplier Performance Survey.  Now from an operations perspective our Nava brewery completed its expansion phase to 25 million hectoliters last quarter ahead of the schedule and we look forward to completing the next phase of expansion taking the brewery to 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year-end. As we speak furnace number three is heating up at the Nava glass plant and is expected to be producing glass later this summer, right on schedule. The Obregon brewery continues to perform at its very high utilization level and we are optimizing existing Obregon capacity and packaging capabilities that are designed to increase output by early next year. These actions have allowed us to take a more measured approach from a timeline standpoint to the greenfield brewery site in Mexicali, while ensuring we have product supply to satisfy our growth expectations. Overall the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are driving the upward revision to our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments. Turning now to Ballast Point, this business has not performed to expectations from a growth standpoint. As a result we recorded an impairment charge related to the trademark value of the acquired brands for the first quarter. However we remained committed to achieving our targeted return on investment for this acquisition. Ballast Point continues to gain distribution and is currently positioned as a top 20 craft brand in the U.S. market. Going forward we are focused on the following; gaining greater distributor alignment with the goal of distributor network where possible, developing a more focused brand architecture led by the flagship Sculpin brand, investing in Ballast Point\u2019s first consumer marketing campaign and leveraging the import side of the beer business as well as other TBA resources within the company.  Overall craft beer continues to be one of the key growth segments within the U.S beer market. We plan to look for ways to leverage the Ballast Point craft beer platform, as it is an important part of our high-end strategy and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business going forward. Now before we begin our discussion of results for our wine and spirits business, I\u2019d like to highlight our recent acquisition of Schrader Cellars, which is a California based fine wine company known for producing superior quality distinctive wines. These wines are sourced from the prestigious vineyards of Napa Valley, including the famed Beckstoffer To Kalon vineyards in Oakville, California. Schrader Cellars is America\u2019s highest rated, highest rated maker of Cabernet Sauvignon with 19, 100 point ratings from legendary critics like Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, James Lobby of Wine Spectator and James Suckling. Today approximately 90% of Schrader\u2019s inventory is sold direct to consumers through an elite mailing list. The reminder is sold through distributor channels to select fine dining establishments with limited availability of approximately 4,000 cases per year. Schrader Cellars typically sells for 225 to 250 per bottles to customers on its mailing list. Overall this world class luxury wine portfolio adds cache to our newly established Fine Wine sales organization. It also provides an opportunity for us to advance our Fine Wine strategy and more fully compete in one of today's fastest growing wine segments, while optimizing our Napa assets and grape supply. During the first quarter our wine business maintained its IRI market share position and delivered excellent margin enhancement driven by a combination of favorable mix and price as well as benefits from our recent acquisition and divestiture activities and our ongoing cost of goods sold optimization initiatives. We have also made good progress against our innovation and renovation activities. After the successful renovation of Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is currently growing at 10% in IRI channels, we recently re-launched brands including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Wild Horse.  And from an innovation perspective, we launched the new seven moons, Red Blend wine brand as well as Cooper & Thief, which has now become the number three luxury Red Wine brand. Our acquired brands are also performing well with High West Whiskey, the Prisoner, and Charles Smith Wines posting recent IRI channel growth of 78%, 35% and more than 100% respectively. During the first quarter, our wine and spirits depletion trends were impacted by the timing of promotional programs. However, we have solid programming in place for our key focus brands in the coming months including the launch of our new TV advertising campaigns for Kim Crawford, Black Box and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. In addition, we are investing in a new digital campaign for the Meiomi brand which is the first ever national advertising program for Meiomi. Our spirits portfolio posted excellent sales growth of 14% in the quarter driven by High West SVEDKA and Paul Masson Brandy. Overall our wine and spirits business is on track to meet our goals for the year. In closing, I am very pleased with our first quarter results which have set the stage for this coming fiscal year. We\u2019ve delivered exceptional performance across the business that demonstrates our commitment through sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. And we remain one of the best performing companies among our consumer peers. With that I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for our first quarter fiscal 2018. Thank you. David Klein : Thanks Rob and good morning, everyone. Fiscal \u201818 is off to a great start, our Q1 results demonstrated strong financial performance as we generated 7% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 530 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 22%. These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. I'll discuss the drivers of this in a moment, but first let's look at Q1 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 7%. Depletion growth came in strong at 11.6% with excellent performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. Shipment growth was below depletion growth primarily due to shipment timing. For Q2 fiscal \u201818 we expect shipment in depletion growth rates to be similar and as a reminder we are facing a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal \u201817. For fiscal \u201818 we continue to expect net sales growth for the year to be in the 9% to 11% range this includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 470 basis points to 40.3%. This strong result exceeded our expectation and reflects lower COGS, foreign currency benefits and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits, driven primarily by supply independence from ABI including better than planned performance at Obregon, lower materials including benefits from glass supply sourcing and lower freight costs. These benefits were partially offset by a $14 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q1. Given the strong operational performance we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the remainder of the year versus Q1 is being primarily driven by the continued ramp up in depreciation, planned headcount addition to support our expanding operating platform, anticipated unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of the year and lower benefits related to ABI supply agreement independence as the year progresses. For wine and spirits organic net sales increased 6%, this primarily reflects favorable mix in price as well as volume growth. U.S. depletions were down 1% and shipment volume outpaced depletions during the quarter due primarily to timing as we expect shipment and depletions to generally align for the full year. As Rob mentioned we have solid promotional and marketing program in place for key brands for the remainder of the year as part of our efforts to achieve our full year goals for the wine and spirits business. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 640 basis points for 29.7%. This improvement primarily reflects favorable mix in price with pricing benefiting from lower promotion spending due to timing, divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and acquisition benefits. For the remainder of the year we expect to see moderation in our wine and spirits operating margin versus Q1, due primarily to higher promotion spending in support of the programming activities I just mentioned. For fiscal \u201818, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions. When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal \u201817 wine and spirits results we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. Interest expense for the year decreased 3% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances. We continue to expect fiscal year \u201818 interest expense to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million. When factoring in cash on hand our net debt at the end of May totaled $9 billion. This was level with our net debt balance at the end of fiscal \u201817. In early May we announced that we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes at attractive investment grade interest rates. These notes were comprised of three $500 million tranches with 5, 10 and 30 year terms and interest rates of 2.7%, 3.5% and 4.5% respectively. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay $700 million of 7.25% notes that were coming due in May and together with revolver borrowings we repaid the remaining balance of our U.S. Term A loan. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.5 times at the end of May from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017. While we continue to invest in our Mexican operation and return cash to shareholders with $100 million of dividends paid in the first quarter. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 19.4% versus 31.6% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign current under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. As a reminder this benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result, we expect to see more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and quarterly basis. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to approximate 22%. The full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be higher than the Q1 rate, primarily due to an anticipate decrease in quarterly stock-based award activity throughout the balance of the year. Historically Q1 has had the highest quarterly stock-based award activity.  For Q2 we are targeting the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, I\u2019d also like to note for fiscal \u201818 we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $201 million and net income attributable to non-controlling interest to approximate $10 million.  As mentioned earlier, we are now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.10. The midpoint of this guidance has is targeting 18% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. This includes an $87 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during Q1 related to the Ballast Point trademarks. As Rob discussed earlier, we are optimistic about Ballast Point and remained focused on achieving our targeted return on that acquisition.  Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $165 million for the quarter. This was slightly below Q1 last year as double-digit operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal 2018 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion.  In closing, our Cellar [ph] portfolio, strong business fundamentals and commitment to generating top tier sales and profit growth will position us to deliver another strong year of financial performance and build shareholder value in fiscal 2018.  With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. So my one question is around M&A, given the expected inflection in free cash flow over the next few years, can you discuss if you think M&A will become an increasing focus going forward, which of the business segments you might be most interested in for M&A. The relative size of deals you\u2019re generally looking at. And then financially just remind us for the key criteria? Rob Sands : Yes, so I would say that our M&A strategy remains the same and I would refer you back to our capital allocation strategy in general, which continues to focus on keeping our debt levels sort of in that 3.5 range, returning moneys to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, dividends and dividend increases. And selective M&A mostly or I should say almost entirely of tuck-in type brands more of the Meiomi kind of nature. So, we just made one Schrader, which I mentioned. So we are going to continue pretty much along that path, we\u2019ll look for brands across actually beer, wine and spirits that we think fills niches that we don't have, that we think are highly synergistic with the platforms that we have across those three segments. I would say really nothing at all has changed and I don't expect anything different than what we've been doing. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks, it's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Rob Sands : Hi, Vivien. Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. So, given how robust your trends are, it really stands in very sharp contrast to some of the softening that we're seeing kind of more broadly in the beer category for a number of your competitors? So, a two part question please. Number one, if you could kind of just give us your view of what's happening more broadly in beer? And then number two, given this evolution in the competitive dynamic, how does that inform your optimism around distribution gains? Because I would think given how strong your growth is, it should facilitate that conversation with retailers. Thanks. Rob Sands : Sure. Now, we've said no two part question, but for your benefit I'll combine that into one answer, okay. First of all what -- because I think it is really one answer. Broadly what's going on in beer alright is you see beer as a generally flat to slightly down market. We believe that the whole beer market in general is fairly tied to the growth or lack thereof and LDAs, legal drinking age, people of 21, that\u2019s flattish and therefore we see beer as flat. However, within beer there is a significant shift going on away from the domestic premiums, the Bud Light, the Coors Light, Miller Light towards the high-end and that's a pretty stark shift that's going on. The beneficiaries in the high-end are largely our portfolio and craft, which continues to be a fairly robust category and continues to grow. And then our business, which is about the same size as craft, the whole craft segment and of course our business remains the most robust portion of the wine business. So, you see the domestic premiums in decline and then you see our portfolio craft and some SMBs like Mike\u2019s taking that all up. And as you\u2019ve seen or read in our previous conferences, we\u2019ve pretty much shown the actual analytics behind how we think that that's going to play out in the future with the domestic dropping quite a bit and our portfolio picking up a lot of that. And of course you see it in IRI where we picked up - Constellation constituted 60% of the growth in the beer market. So, what we've said is going to happen in the past is in fact happening. I think that fundamentally answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Rob Sands : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : Hi, good morning everyone. So, on Corona Premier, it looks like these test markets are progressing fairly well. How much time do you guys need before you can make an assessment on a national launch? And then just housekeeping item, what were the shipments and depletions in beer ex-Ballast Point if you could give us that number? David Klein : So on that Nik, the Ballast Point was about a 50 basis points drag on depletions for total beer. Nik Modi : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong\u2026 Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Is the national rollout of premier\u2026 Rob Sands : Yes, so I didn\u2019t answer the national rollout for Corona Premier and Familiar, both I would say are actually exceeding our expectations in test market. We haven\u2019t made a decision on an actual date for national rollout, but I would expect that decision to come fairly soon and I would say that it's likely to be a favorable decision on national rollout. So, that's about as much as we can say at the moment but\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Rob Sands : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi, so I guess I have to ask a beer margin question. So clearly 40% pretty impressive here. David just I think your comment about this may not be sustainable for the balance of the year, so just trying to get a little bit more color around that. DNA and pricing I think is essentially a wash, the peso I guess is becoming a little bit of a headwind, but when you talk about the headcount increase that\u2019s potentially a headwind, can you just elaborate on - sort of quantify what that means? Can you compare the brewery margins for Piedras and Obregon and other kind of headwinds you\u2019re envisioning for the balance of the year? David Klein : Yes, so the first thing I want to say is that the operations teams at Nava and at Obregon performed exceptionally well in the first quarter while the plants were operating at high utilization levels. And I would say that a portion of our rational really for increasing our EBIT growth rate for beer was really we have been pleased by the lack of transition friction at Obregon that we have perhaps expected going into the year. So now for the remainder of the year I would -- Judy I think the biggest headwind that we see is really coming from FX in the business. In Q1 on a year-over-year basis in Q1 we actually had a bit of tailwind from FX. But we know that right now the peso is sitting below 18 pesos to the dollar. And we disclosed in the beginning of the year that our guidance was based around 20 pesos to the dollar that presents a pretty significant headwind for us. Beyond that we also mentioned depreciation that\u2019s quantifiable right, because we have already said that our depreciation is expected to up about $60 million on the year. And then we have as we get -- as we move through the year we\u2019re bringing in more -- as we bring more equipment online we are bringing in about 300 additional heads, which will put a bit of a drag on our business. At the same time the utilization starts to fall up in the plants, right, because remember we run them at high utilization throughout Q1 and Q2 and then it drops off a little bit at the back half for the year. And then I know I say this every single time we talk about margins, but you just have to continue expect volatility in our margins as we try to optimize the lines and brew [trends] [ph] that we bring into service over the course of the year.  So, we are really happy to have achieved 40% operating margins in Q1 and I guess I will say Judy you kind of called that before anybody else, but we do have to be careful because there are some significant and real headwinds for the rest of the year. Judy Hong : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you. Just going back to the point about the cadence of beer during the quarter and there has been obviously a lot of volatility especially from your competitors and your shipments have been lower than depletions, which obviously is a nature of the business itself. But can you comment on the cadence throughout the quarter and if you are seeing acceleration of the shipment as you\u2019re going through your second quarter? Thank you. David Klein : Yes, I think Andrea the real disconnect in Q1 really was because of the strength of our depletions coming out of Cinco and then going into the Memorial Day Holiday and it\u2019s just the timing issue in terms of getting our shipments to align. Not necessarily on a growth rate basis but on a case rate basis we expect shipments and depletions in beer to align over the course of the year there\u2019ll just be fluctuations between the quarters. Andrea Teixeira : And a one last follow-up question, sorry, because it was about like the previous question on the FX. From what I understand you're hedged -- from your K, you\u2019re hedging about 50% of your exposure, correct to the peso at the [indiscernible] level and the rest is actually floating. David Klein : Well so about half of our currency exposure for the remainder of the year is hedged, it\u2019s hedged at a very -- at various different levels, but it\u2019s in included the hedges that we have is included in our outlook. We value the contracts at the same time we are valuing the remaining exposures. Andrea Teixeira : And you also including that effect on your financial expenses, right. Your outlook for your financial expenses includes the cost of the hedges and the resets of the hedges, correct? David Klein : Yes correct, correct. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, appreciate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS. Stephen Powers : Great thanks. A question on Pacifico and the plans there, just given what you\u2019re seeing from the broader market competitively both old and new competitors and I think the most obvious new catalysts is still moving into most in course hands. Does that change at all how you\u2019re thinking about the timing and or approach to the ramp up of Pacifico overtime? Rob Sands : No, not at all. There\u2019s always a few Mexican brands that are being introduced by various parties whether it\u2019s Molson Coors or ABI, I mean, that\u2019s not going to change. And what I\u2019ve emphasized about that is that the large part of the growth in the beer business is in our portfolio a lot of people talked about it as it imports or in Mexican while it\u2019s really Constellation\u2019s imports in Mexican portfolio. So these other entrants don\u2019t really concern us very much. And sales been around forever and might sell I don\u2019t know a 200,000 cases in the entire United States. So I don\u2019t see this particularly important. Now Pacifico you asked about that, Pacifico is just also on fire, without are frankly doing too much to drive it and we\u2019re ramping up on our plants to drive Pacifico and we sort of see this perhaps the next big thing right behind Modelo Especial, I mean, we have a lot of sort of anecdotal evidence as far as some market research that indicates the consumer acceptance of the product is wildly overwhelming. Historically we didn\u2019t drive it because we didn\u2019t have the capacity to do anything more than what we\u2019re doing we now have the capacity it\u2019s coming on stream and Pacifico is definitely the next logical thing that really drive behind Corona and Modelo Especial. So we\u2019re I\u2019d say extremely optimistic about that. In addition to our NPD, Premier I think has a huge amount of promise and Familiar is like a phenomena already. So we\u2019re excited about all three things. Stephen Powers : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Yes, thanks. My one question wine and spirits margins it\u2019s only one quarter, but they\u2019re dramatically above the way we all on this tree modeled it and yet you haven\u2019t changed your full year margin view. My question is obviously we could have just gotten the modeling wrong, but to what extent did you consider the first quarter disappointing from a revenue perspective and what else has prompted you not to increase the margin guide for that portion of your business? David Klein : Well so first Mark the thing that I think is becoming or should be becoming more and more obvious is that while there is a lot of focus on the beer business our wine and spirits business is a very powerful business with margins that are approaching 30 and we\u2019ve stated publicly that our goal is to get them to 30. So what\u2019s tempering our expectations for the remainder of the year are really two things, one is we got about 200 basis points of year-over-year improvement in wine margins as a result of the sale of the Canadian business. For the full year that 200 basis points is more like 100 right because we sold the wine business before the end of last -- well before the end of last fiscal year. So there\u2019s 100 basis points of that benefit that goes away over the course of the remainder of the year. And the second thing is you might recall that our promotions expense is accrued based upon depletions not shipments. So we got some benefit in the quarter because of the difference between our shipments number and our depletions number. So we\u2019re very optimistic about wine margins and our guidance for the year assumes that there is wine margin leverage. And so we remained committed to that, we\u2019re just remaining cautious because of the two items I mentioned. Mark Swartzberg : And would it be fair to say that because depletions were down, they were disappointing versus your plan? David Klein : I would say that we\u2019re on track to achieve our guidance for the year. As Rob called out in his script, we had some planned promotion timing differences that affected our depletions in the first quarter, now clearly we never want negative depletions, but we remained confident in our full year guidance. Mark Swartzberg : Great, thanks David. Operator : Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, it\u2019s actually Yatish [ph] in for Pablo. Just one question, in regards to your typical retail store, would you able to comment on average, how many skews you would have for Corona versus Modelo Especial, is it like one-to-one, three-to-one, any kind of rough idea would be helpful. Thanks. Rob Sands : In the company we have very few skews is a general preposition, but I don\u2019t know the answer exactly to your question, how many skews of Corona do we have versus Modelo Especial, we will get back to you on that. Patty will give you. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. So, as I recall these are the best ever margins in wine and beer and as spectacular as they are, it really the biggest news I think in the quarter is the ability to issue this debt at amazing rates, which gives you a tremendous amount of optionality in the M&A market. Rob you kind of soft pedal debt saying it\u2019s incremental, it\u2019s tuck-ins but there was a rumor of a very large deal this quarter and it seems like with your current balance sheet, you may be really well positioned to do a major deal. Can you talk about not anything specific, but the optionality of significant deal? Rob Sands : Yes, I mean I think that it remains fundamentally as I said, which is I think the real opportunity is brands and tuck-in deals and that\u2019s something that we can keep doing and do it and meet our financial disciplines which is important part of that, I mean, we buy brands like Meiomi or other brands we can tuck it into our existing infrastructure. These things are growing very high double-digits and we are buying them at reasonable multiples, which post synergies are multiples that generate actually a high return. So I\u2019d say fundamentally that strategy versus buying something really big is a good strategy from a financial perspective and from the perspective of positioning our portfolios across wine, beer and spirits for continued growth, which -- growth and margins, which is -- that\u2019s really the strategy, right. Is to keep driving this kind of growth and these kind of margins and the kind of leverage that we\u2019re seeing in our P&L by at least as it relates to M&A now there is other elements of it like NPD, things like term premier and familiar, but as it relates to the M&A we can keep sort of adding on a very financially viable basis these kind of brands. Now, as far as anything big goes, there is two issues there, one is there is nothing for sale and two, there is very little that would be of any interest even if it was for sell fundamentally for three reasons, right. There is financial element of it will it generate kind of return that we wanted to generate, And then number two, we go back to sales, growth and margins there is very few big things that when potentially be somewhat dilutive to our sales growth and to our margins. So we would tread pretty carefully on anything like that. So yes in the end we\u2019re talking about big things you can count it on a half a hand right, there not much in the business. David Klein : I would also add to that Rob that\u2026 Rob Sands : And you can exclude ABI. David Klein : And I would add to that\u2026 Rob Sands : They don\u2019t have the growth either, but they do have the margin. David Klein : Last year we bought $1.2 billion of our own stock back at $151 a share. So we still think we\u2019re the best buy in alcohol. Rob Sands : Yes that\u2019s looking pretty good right now that investment. Tim Ramey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : First off just congratulations on a terrific quarter. If you give a little bit of clarity there\u2019s just a question that I have around guidance in a comment that you made Rob earlier on if I got it right and that is despite raising the EPS guidance it looks like you\u2019re keeping your cash flow guidance flat. There was also comment that you said early on that the progress you\u2019re making I think you said at Obregon and some of the other facilities was allowing you to moderate the rollout or the expenditures in Mexicali if I got that right. So I'm just trying to put those items together to think through what your cash flow guidance means here. Rob Sands : Yes so I\u2019ll let David answer a part of this question, but my comment about Obregon and Mexicali was just really more of the same in other words the guidance that we\u2019ve given thus far on our CapEx as it relates to Mexicali and Obregon hasn\u2019t changed.  And we basically told you about that when we acquired Obregon we basically said that we were going to cut Mexicali the initial first stage of it back to $5 million hectoliters because we didn\u2019t need to go to full $10 million hectoliters on Mexicali given that we bought almost that amount in Obregon and we\u2019ll have that amount as we make some small modifications to Obregon. So there\u2019s really no difference put it this way between what we said previously at the end of the year and what we\u2019re saying now we\u2019re just in essence repeating ourselves. And then as to your point on EPS and cash flow I\u2019ll let David talk about that. David Klein : Yes, so Robert I think on total cash flow guidance the largest lever as you\u2019re pointing out is our capital expenditures. And I would just say that one quarter into the year it\u2019s too early to call any changes there. But we clearly carefully manage our working capital and our CapEx spend to optimize those numbers. Robert Ottenstein : Terrific, thank you very much, very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Laurent Grandet : Good morning, everyone. So with approximately 75% of retail market share in Mexican beer, could you give us some comfort us to why you think retailers will give you more shelves, more market share? Not usually their typical mindset to put all the eggs in one basket usually now that there is a bit more competition coming in Mexican beer? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes I think it\u2019s fairly simple and that is that our shelf space relative our market share greatly under indexes. I mean, I can\u2019t even tell you what that number is, but we have a much smaller percentage of the shelf in the store than we have in the market share and the proposition is simple, okay. Increase our shelf space and you\u2019ll sell more of our beer and it\u2019s not just shelf space it\u2019s cold box space as well versus giving that space to declining low margin product. So you get two choices, right, you can give the space to us and sell more of a high margin item or give the space to somebody else and watch your sales and velocity and your margins decline. So, as I go around and talk to retailers, they get that, okay. And I can tell you right now, retailers need to do a significant rethinking of their assortment in beer. Fundamentally their beer assortments make no sense anymore for them. On the assumption that their goal is to improve their sales and margin as a business, okay. It makes no sense; they have 20% of the store allocated to 5 billion craft that nobody has ever heard of. And then to have the vast majority of the rest of the store allocated to low margin declining brands and then a smaller amount of the store allocated to fast moving high margin, high end brands it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. And so, I think you'll see a change in that and we're certainly driving as the high-end leader in beer. We hopefully will be driving that change because I think it\u2019s a change that has to happen sooner or later and that's going to dictate probably as that change occurs, you\u2019ll actually see these trends in beer they\u2019ll actually accelerate, which is part of the reason why it doesn\u2019t occur. Because those who are hanging on are trying desperately to hang on to everything that they've got to mitigate precisely that scenario. And for us it's just a gigantic opportunity because we're punching under our weight. So we have the opportunity to not only generate the kind of performance that we've been generating, but enhance that performance if we could start -- if we could get retailers to understand and act, they understand it, it\u2019s getting them to act on it. So -- and we're having some success in that regard and we expect to have more success in the future. And I think you'll see retailers start rethinking their assortment in beer to take advantage of the high-end and Constellation opportunity in particular. Laurent Grandet : Thank you very much, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Stephanie Spinner : Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding on the wine business organic growth. So obviously you are entering your first and second year after your Prisoner and Meiomi acquisitions. So, how much of the growth in the quarter is coming from distribution gains and should we start to see some tougher comps in the remainder of the year? Or I guess kind of put in other way is the growth coming from distribution gains kind of compared to the overall growth of the market? So just more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes, I would say fundamentally organic growth it's hard -- that's an interesting number that's hard to get at. But I think that you can fundamentally look at IRI as the best measure of our organic growth, which I think that the markets growing sort of low single-digit right now call it in that 3% type range with 200 basis points of price mix and we expect to grow in line with that organically and fundamentally with some quarter-to-quarter type fluctuations. But I think we feel fairly confident that that's what the years going to end up looking like in general. And our ships and our depletes will equal each other by year-end. And as I said, I think that you will see sort of a conversions between ships, depletes and IRI in our wine business. That sort of how things are shaping up, which is good. I mean, I think a strong performance, especially given the profitability of that business and the fact that we can then leverage we think that we\u2019ll be able to leverage that as we\u2019ve guided to generate higher even higher bottom-line return. So it\u2019s very, very strong business in many respects. I always like to say that it\u2019s only in contrast to the beer business that these questions even get raised, I mean, as a standalone business generating 30% margins sort of almost mid-single-digit sales growth, leveraging the P&L, if you weren\u2019t looking at it in contrast to our beer business you would be running around saying, this is one of the best businesses that there is. So, even looking at ROIC, which nobody even talks about anymore, I don\u2019t know why, but our ROIC in wine is up in the double-digits. And then if you look at the accretion of ROIC it\u2019s like high-teens low 20s, 20% return on invested capital for any incremental growth that we have in our wine business. So by almost any standard that you can imagine it\u2019s a tremendous business, nothing looks like it expect for other alcoholic beverage companies and too many of them in tobacco. I mean, that\u2019s about it and tobacco to tobacco. Then it\u2019s all downhill from there. So it\u2019s at the pinnacle of performance pretty much, other than our beer business and a couple of other perhaps. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Good morning everyone and congrats. Just digging into your core portfolio, could you tell us how Corona performed as well as Corona Light just to get a sense of your flagship brand -- sorry Modelo Especial and Corona Light? And then just as a major of success for Premier are you looking at it in terms of how much share it takes or whether it impacts Ultra or how are you thinking about things when you said doing well? David Klein : Yes so, so actually Rob in his script talked about say Modelo Especial approaching 20% depletion growth. Corona Extra was in that 6% range and Corona Light was a little bit less than that. So all of the brands are performing quite well, and Rob maybe you want to take the Premier question. Rob Sands : Yes, I think that Premier looks very strong. We are looking at things like velocities per point of distribution, which appear to be very strong. Cannibalization is not something we\u2019re overly concern with because there is really no margins disadvantage. And so as long as one plus one equals three, we are okay with that, now we don\u2019t want cannibalization of something that\u2019s good with something that\u2019s not going to be sustainable. So the big key is just making sure that we believe that from a consumer acceptance point of view that Premier represents a sustainable and growing preposition, which right now I would say our preliminary read on that is that it\u2019s looking pretty good in terms of the contributions that it can make, its sustainability, it's positioning in the marketplace. I mean, well needless to say what are the hardest brands in beer, right of any size. The hardest brands in beer they size are basically Corona, Modelo Especial and Mic Ultra, okay. Premier is a more upscale, more premium competitor to Mic Ultra with the power and this is probably a very important point, right. Because anybody can make a beer with that the calorie and the carb characteristics of Mic Ultra. But with the power of an elite brand behind it with all of the consumer acceptance and recognition that goes with it. So it\u2019s definitely a segment of the market that I think is hot, it\u2019s here to stay, it\u2019s what been driving Mic Ultra, I think it\u2019s going to drive Corona Premier as well, because it's got the characteristic. The liquid in the bottle is great, obviously we test all that and we test it against competitors and we test it with consumers who drink that kind of beer, okay. And we have extremely positive results on that. So, I think it\u2019s looking very good and it\u2019s a point to remember that, right. It\u2019s consumers, the Premier is started the consumers who drink that kind of beer and are looking for precisely that profile of product. So if are a IITA drinker yes, of course you are not drinking Mic Ultra and you\u2019re not going to drink Premier. On the other hand, if you are Mic Ultra drinker I think Premier makes a -- is a nice alternative to that in every respect. Operator : Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : So, thank you very much everybody for joining today\u2019s call. I want to reiterate how very pleased we are with the fantastic execution that drove our excellent first quarter results, and my kudos to our people, our distributors, our retailers who continue to be part of the virtual cycle that drive those results. We are very optimistic about our future business opportunities which gives us the confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. And as we head into the July 4th holiday weekend, I hope you remember to drink some of our fine wine products, as well as beer products and spirits products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them responsibly. So thank you and everyone should have a great 4th of July weekend. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would like to convey my sincere sympathy to all who have been affected by the string of recent natural disasters and tragedies. Thankfully the earthquakes in Mexico did not have an impact on our production operations there, but our sympathies to all of our affected families. So now, let's get started with our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. We delivered exceptional results for the second quarter of our fiscal year. Throughout the business, we gained share overall, improved margins, continued to generate strong free cash flow, and executed exceptionally well both operationally and end market. These results are a testament to the fact that our total beverage alcohol or TBA strategy is paying-off. We remained a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, and we are reaping the benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy. As a matter of fact, our beer business which remains the number one growth driver in the high end of the U.S. beer market generated more than 60% of the growth of this market segment during the quarter.  Overall Constellation has been the clear winner during the 120 days of summer for the past four years growing dollar share of the total beer market more than any other leading supplier.  Excellent execution during the July 4 holiday, the most important holiday for the U.S. beer industry, drove significant market share gains for the quarter. During this timeframe, Constellation had five brands in the top $20 share gainers, including Modelo Especial and Corona Extra in the number two and number three positions, as well as Pacifico, Modelo Negra, Modelo Chelada, and Tamarindo Picante for example.  Record level distribution gains and increased media activities continued to drive greater than 60% of our overall depletion growth. Across the portfolio, you can see excellent results of these efforts.  Additional TV advertising and digital support propelled Corona Extra, which was recently named by InterBrand as one of the best global brands of 2017 for the eighth year in a row. The Corona can format grew more than 20% during the quarter, with the launch of its limited edition, Beach in a Can packaging. And Corona Extra was the official beer sponsor of the Mayweather versus McGregor fight, which set the new record for the largest viewing boxing audience. Modelo Especial increased TV advertising and promotional investments beginning with the NBA finals in early June, and was also named the official beer of two prominent soccer tournaments, including the Gold Cup, all of which led to the games in trial and awareness versus a year ago. And Modelo Chelada Especial was recently named 2017 Nielson Breakthrough Innovation Award Winner.  These activities drove depletion growth of almost 20% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for the quarter. Pacifico continues to capture new consumers by building brand awareness and trial across the brand\u2019s priority geographies. During the quarter, Pacifico TV advertising aired across the Western U.S., Colorado and Texas.  Now this activity was complemented by year round social media support on both Facebook and Instagram. In addition, the Summer X Games chose Pacifico as their exclusive beer partner for their competition in July.  As we head into the second half of the year, the beer portfolio is well positioned from a marketing and promotional perspective, supporting the professional and college football season, as well as key boxing and soccer sponsorships. Our innovation test markets for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to be very successful. As a result we plan to nationally launch Premier beginning in fiscal 2019, with Familiar rolling out to all major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand during the same time frame. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the benefits of these new product introductions have already been included in the growth goals that we have outlined at our New York City Investor Day last November. During the quarter, we added Funky Buddha Brewery to our newly established Craft and Specialty Beer business. Florida based Funky Buddha is a regional craft beer player and South Florida's largest craft microbrewery by size and volume. The acquisition of Funky Buddha is a continuation of our beer strategy to be the leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. This brand has great potential and plenty of runway for future growth and we plan to leverage that potential to begin building a stronger presence in the high-end craft beer as this market segment continues to be one of the key growth drivers within the U.S. beer market. Our goal is to continue to grow distribution of the brand throughout the State of Florida, as well as targeted expansions into key new states. From an operations perspective, our capital expansion projects in Mexico continues to be on track on all fronts. The Nava Brewery achieved record production volumes during the second quarter and we look forward to completing the next phase of expansion taking the brewery to 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year-end.  Glass Furnace number 3 is now fully operational and ramping to peak efficiency levels. The Obregon Brewery continues to perform at very high utilization levels, and we are currently optimizing existing capacity as we plan to increase capacity in both brewing and packaging before the end of the fiscal year. Construction continues in Mexicali and we are making solid progress. Brewhouse tank fabrication and installation are currently in process; and building structures for brewing, packaging, and utilities are well underway. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in second quarter are driving the upward revision in our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments. Now turning to our wine and spirits business, during the second quarter, we gained momentum for our wine business gaining market share and delivering strong depletion growth of 5%. And while we continue to improve margins for this business, the significant margin enhancement that we saw in the first quarter from positive mix and a divestiture of the Canadian business were somewhat offset by planned investments in marketing primarily for our focused brands as well as promotional activity as shipments and depletions became aligned through the first half of the year. These investments are obviously paying off as we posted depletion growth of more than 12% for our focused brands during the quarter driven by Black Box, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, and SWEDKA Vodka. And within our focused brand portfolio, our top five profit contributors are collectively growing volume 10% with profits also growing double-digits year-to-date. As we head into our key selling season for the wine and spirits business, we have solid programming in place and are well positioned to develop our goals for the year. Planned investments including Black Box Digital Advertising, the launch of a new TV campaign for Kim Crawford beginning this fall, as well as the continuation of Woodbridge TV and digital advertising to increase awareness and fuel momentum for this brand. In addition, the new first ever national digital advertising program for Meiomi will continue leading up to the holidays. Now from an innovation perspective, the 7 Moons Red Blend Wine brand is gaining momentum and has already become a top 10 premium Red Blend. And our recent Rose line extensions have taken off including Meiomi, Kim Crawford and Black Box Rose brands. Our acquired wine and spirits brands are performing exceptionally well, including High West Whiskey and Casa Noble tequila, as well as the Prisoner, Meiomi and Charles Smith Wine Brands. On a year-to-date basis, through the first half, these brands collectively delivered depletion growth of 23% with a gross margin in the 60% range. And following the recent Schrader acquisition Constellation has become a top $100 plus Cabernet Sauvignon wine producer.  Our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by High West Whiskey. In addition, SVEDKA Vodka gained market share of the vodka category due impart to the successful launch of the new SVEDKA Blue Roseberry flavor. Now in closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results and what we have accomplished in the first half of the year. The total beverage alcohol portfolio remains strong. As many of our high-end beer and premium wine and spirits brands gain share. It is these products that remain growth drivers within the TBA category, which is expected to continue in the future. In addition, our portfolio performance and execution by our commercial and operational teams continues to drive margin benefits, giving us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. With that I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the second quarter. David Klein : Thanks, Rob and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone saw our new press release format and found it helpful. We decided to provide the financial press, analyst and investors with our financial results, accomplishments and strategic initiatives in a more concise and easy to use format. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued strong financial performance as we generated 8% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 340 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 14%. These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which along with anticipated favorability in our tax rate is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $8.25 to $8.40 per share. We believe the recent natural disasters had a minor impact on our Q2 results and may have some minimal impact on Q3 results, which we factored into our new guidance. However, we continue to monitor the situation in these affected areas. Let's look at Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 12%. Depletion growth came in at 8% as we won the 4th of July holiday and the rest of the key summer selling season. We overlapped a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal \u201817. Shipment growth ran ahead of depletion growth after we saw the opposite trend in Q1. For the first half of the year shipment and depletion growth rates are both in the 9% to 10% range, this has us on track to meet our net sales goal for fiscal \u201818 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 420 basis points to 41.1%, primarily due to lower COGS, favorable pricing and foreign currency benefits. The lower COGS reflect benefits from supply independence from ABI and glass sourcing as we saw strong operational performance at our breweries and glass plant during the peak summer production period. Our Nave Brewery generated record production volume and performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a $13 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q2. Given the strong operational performance, we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 17% to 19%. The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the back half of the year versus the first half of the year is being primarily driven by lower production volume due to normal seasonality, combined with the continued ramp up in depreciation and line commissioning costs including headcount additions to support our expanding operating platform.  In addition SG&A leverage is impacted by the lower volumes that occur in the second half of the year, as a result of the seasonality of the business. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected an unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of fiscal \u201818. However this headwind has been mitigated through our hedging program and we currently expect an unfavorable currency impact to be fairly minimal. For wine and spirits, we saw a strong Q2 U.S. depletion growth of 5%, which outpaced U.S. shipment volume, primarily due to timing, as we reported shipments ahead of depletions in Q1. This contributed to Q2 organic net sales being down 1% as favorable mix was more than offset by lower volume. Promotional expense was higher in Q2 than Q1 due impart to the increase in depletions we saw in Q2 versus Q1. At the half way mark of fiscal \u201818, organic net sales are up 2% and U.S. depletions are also up 2%, while operating margin increased 330 basis points, driving operating income growth of 5%. For the quarter, wine and spirits operating margin increased 40 basis points to 26.2%. This improvement primarily reflects the divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and favorable mix, partially offset by higher marketing investments. For fiscal \u201818, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith, and Prisoner acquisitions.  When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal \u201817 wine and spirits results, we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. The moderation of our wine and spirits operating growth in the back half of fiscal \u201818 implied by our guidance is being driven primarily by Q3 activities, including planned marketing and SG&A investments during the key holiday season and loss of $17 million of operating income from the Canadian wine business, which was recognized in Q3 last year. As a result of these factors, we are targeting and wine and spirits operating income to be down in the low to mid-teens range for Q3 fiscal \u201818 on a reported basis. I\u2019d also like to note, that as part of our premiumization efforts, we have been rationalizing lower margin, value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal \u201818, while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense decreased 14% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances. We now expect fiscal year \u201818 interest expense to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. The improvement is primarily related to short-term interest rates, trending more favorable than our earlier projections.  We recently announced plans to launch a Commercial Paper Program to improve short-term borrowing costs, which is typical for investment grade companies. The program is expected to be an unregistered private placement and provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. The program is expected to be supported with available commitments under our revolving credit facility, so it will not result in an increase in the total amount of our authorized debt.  When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of August totaled $8.8 billion, a $230 million decrease from our net debt balance at the end of fiscal 2017. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.3 times at the end of August from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17, while we continue to invest in our Mexican operations, build our portfolio and return cash to shareholders with $201 million worth of dividends paid and $14 million of stock repurchases during the first half of the year. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 20.5% versus 31.8% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign earnings under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement.  For fiscal '18 we now expect the effective tax rate to approximate 21% versus our previous guidance of 22%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increase in forecasted excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards and lower effective tax rates on the foreign earnings of our beer business. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year tax rate and Q4 to be in line with that full year rate. I would also like to note for fiscal '18 we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximately 201 million shares and net income attributable to non-controlling interest is now expected to approximate $10 million to $15 million versus our prior estimate of about $10 million. As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.25 to $8.40. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 23% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release.  Moving to free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $598 million of free cash flow for the first half of fiscal '18 versus $676 million for the same period last year. As operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. We did not revise our free cash flow as the benefit from our projected earnings increase is expected to be offset by unfavorable timing of recoverable value added taxes. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexico beer operations expansion. In closing, our beer business continues to deliver impressive operational and marketplace execution, while generating top tier sales and profit growth. And our portfolio premiumization efforts continue to enhance the financial profile of our wine and spirits business.  With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. Rob Sands : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So first just a detail question. David you indicated hedging offsets a lot of the peso FX margin impact in beer this fiscal year. I'm just wondering if you can quantify if we stayed at current spot rates, can you give us a sense for how much of a drag FX will be to beer margins in fiscal '19? And then the real question is Rob, I was hoping you could flush out a bit more detail on Corona Premier success in test markets. It looks pretty solid at around 3% of sales in the test markets and tracked channels. So just any details around the magnitude of traction for the brand in test markets, the cannibalization that you're seeing on the rest of the portfolio, and then any expectations around the national launch next fiscal year. Thanks. David Klein : So Dara, on the first part the current effective FX rate, so kind of net of our hedges on a year-to-date basis is probably in that mid-18s range. So to the extent that current spot\u2019s a little lower than that, it would be a bit of a drag next year, but not much. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Rob Sands : Yes, so as it relates to Premier, the test markets have been very successful. What do we mean by successful, what we are looking at is pretty much things like velocity per point of distribution, which for a new product, Premier\u2019s velocity per point of distribution was high. And the other thing that we are looking at which is in actuality a relatively minor concern is cannibalization, which actually turned out to be significantly lower than we expected.  Now I\u2019d say that cannibalization is a relatively minor concern and that\u2019s cannibalization of our own products because there is no margin difference between Corona Premier and the other products, so cannibalization isn\u2019t really an issue as long as one plus one equals three. And right now I would say that it\u2019s looking definitively like one plus one will equal three, because given our market shares versus the rest of the market, if cannibalization is the right term, we\u2019re really taking share from competitors not to a large degree from ourselves, which makes logical sense. So, looks good. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Rob Sands : Hey Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning everyone. My question was around advertising. Can you give us a sense David, sort of specifically in beer what type of increase you\u2019ve had in advertising and promotion this year? And then, I guess some color on still are you getting the immediate lift, when you are adding more marketing and advertising in the market, and I think that was the case last year. So just trying to get a sense if you are putting more into the market and if you are still getting that good sort of immediate lift off your advertising? David Klein : Yes, so, it was still -- we are still running in general in that 8.5% to 9% range. Clearly, that means the dollars are up because of the growth of our business. And just kind of as a note, we will see as a percentage of net sales higher marketing spend in Q3, simply because of the lower sales quarter and we spend money with the NFL property. So again we\u2019re spending about the same percentage as we have in the past. And yet we continue to see really impressive returns on our marketing spend in our beer business, which I think is tribute to the quality of the advertising that our marketing team puts in place, as well as the power of the brands. But we monitor that return on an ongoing basis, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our brands in our beer business, and you\u2019re going to see us begin to invest more in our brands in our wine business, which will also see a fairly large increase on a percentage of net sales basis in Q3 versus where we have been in the past. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Adam Scott : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Adam Scott on line for Bonnie. Question on the wine and spirits business, obviously really great performance in Focus brands with depletions up 12%, but the implied growth of non-Focus brands was almost down 6%. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind these brands and maybe whether at some point it might make sense to divest them or perhaps to reinvigorate them, since they are such a drag. So if you could just touch on that, that\u2019d be great. Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes, so what you just suggested is not at all unusual in that. Our Focus brands constitutes the vast majority of our sales and profit, it\u2019s almost like a perfect Pareto principle type situation, which almost every company exhibits. In that, a relatively small number of our brands, i.e., our Focus brands which are about 17 or so brands constitutes about 70%, 80% of our profits. And yes, so therefore the rest of the portfolio does represent what we might call tail brands or perhaps more euphemistically technical brands. The interesting thing in the wine and spirits business is regardless of the growth rate, every brand is profitable and a contributor, therefore to our overall profits. And therefore it makes economic sense to keep them when you look at what the potential value would be to a third party from a discounted cash flow basis versus the value to ourselves. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t divest the tail. We also don\u2019t spend a lot of time on it from an operational, marketing, or activity point of view.  Now that said, we have divested lower margin, lower growth tail businesses and brands in the past, where it makes economic sense to do so in the manner that I just described meaning taking a look at what the NPV of the future cash flows of those businesses are compared to what we think that we can sell that for. Canada is a good example of that, a number of years ago, we sold off our value wine business Almaden and Inglenook. We sold of our value spirits business as an example brands like Barton and Crystal Palace, and Mr. Boston and so on and so forth. So we are always evaluating that, but I have given you basically the method under, which we evaluate that and generally speaking the brands that are in our portfolio now are worth more to us than they would be to a third party and that\u2019s why we keep up. And they are profitable and therefore they help fuel the investments that we make in the focus brands. David Klein : Yes, just one other thing to add to that, Adam, as I said in my script that we have been doing some SKU rationalization, which creates about or create about 100 basis points drag on growth. Nut that\u2019s just good business where we can discontinue a SKU that has a like low 30 margins and replace it with a SKU that has 50% or 60% margins using the same assets. Adam Scott : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Terrific quarter and very nice press release, well done, I like the new format. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit -- I understand for the year your shipments and depletions are in line, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the quarter specifically, why there was such a large difference. Our sense was that they were going to come in close, did that have to do with some year-end slowdown in business or a lot of extra shelf space. So just trying to get a sense specifically for the quarter, why the big difference please? David Klein : So you are talking about beer Robert? Robert Ottenstein : Yes, yes, beer shipments and depletions please. David Klein : Yes, so from -- so when we look at it from a growth rate perspective, what -- I guess so in the first quarter of the year, sorry I am just backing up here. So in the first quarter of the year, we -- you're referencing the fact that we depleted more than we shipped. So we were able to recover in the second quarter, and I would say that we probably did a little bit better job in the recovery than we may have expected thanks to some amazing performance by our operations we\u2019re able to ship a little bit more beer than we would have expected, bringing our distributor inventory days back in line where we would like them to be. Robert Ottenstein : Okay. So your brewery operations ran more efficiently than you thought they would, so you were able to ship more is that the answer? David Klein : That's the majority of the answer. And yes, it's not even the efficiency the level of utilization at our breweries was quite high. And again some amazing work by our teams in Mexico. Robert Ottenstein : Terrific. Congratulations and thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Swartzberg : Yes, thank you and good morning everyone. Rob and David too, I'm confused why you haven't committed to repo. And the reason I say that is we heard you in November say, we've clarified our leverage objective, it's now 3.5 and we're now sitting at kind of 3.2, 3.3 levels. And there is no comment on repo and the cash flow is going to continue to come. So what's going on and as far as your priorities from an M&A perspective, is it fair to think spirits is your highest priority if you have to consider the comparative share you have there versus your other two businesses? David Klein : So I'll comment on the repurchase component and I'll let Rob comment on M&A. Our capital allocation philosophy Mark hasn't changed at all. So we said when we were below 3.5 times we would look to buyback our dilution on a systematic basis and more than our dilution say opportunistically. And remember, we\u2019ve repurchased $1.2 billion worth of stock towards the tail-end of last fiscal year. So we waited in Q2 until we got below 3.5 times and then we started with our systematic repurchase of our dilution granted it only amounted to $14 million in the quarter. But that's more of a timing issue than anything else. So we remain committed to our capital allocation principles. Mark Swartzberg : And then maybe there is a nuance I missed. But is 3.5 the objective or are you willing to go lower than that? David Klein : So we're going to continue to operate the business kind of targeting 3.5. Now that said, I'm not sure we'll be dogmatic to stay exactly at 3.5, but we will stay in that 3.5 times range over a medium term period of time. Mark Swartzberg : Got it, okay. Rob Sands : And what was your question on M&A Mark? Mark Swartzberg : Well spirits comparatively high priority versus beer in terms of the size of the assets you might purchase the spirits comparatively higher priority than the other two alcohol businesses. Rob Sands : Not necessarily. We continue to look across all three categories. So fundamentally, you could see tuck-in acquisitions across beer, wine and spirits. And I'd say we're fairly agnostic relative to the three categories it's more a question of growth and margins and what is -- what we think is opportunistic. So there is good examples across all three categories of tuck-in acquisitions if they were available that would meet the growth and margin and economic criteria that we have. So I wouldn't in any way see performance expect to see from us either just spirits or just beer, just wine I think you\u2019re going to see more of the same kind of the thing that you've seen in the past. So we bought High West, we bought Casa Noble, we bought Charles Smith, we brought Funky Buddha. I mean, so it's been a mix it will continue to be a mix. Mark Swartzberg : Great, thank you. David Klein : By the way Mark, if the question also relates to by not staying at 3.5 times are we in some way loading up for something, the answer is no, it just we're going to be around that 3.5 times range and we do intend to buy our stock back as well as invest in our business as well as do M&A. Mark Swartzberg : Super, I'm glad you so that that exactly what I was trying to get clarity on. Thank you gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Good morning and again my congratulations and I think you just set the gold standard in press releases. In terms of the -- I was just wonder if you could help us understand this growth in beer, if you took your biggest brands Corona and Modelo, could you quantify perhaps how much of their growth is distribution gains and how much I mean how happy are you with the trends in velocities at existing point of distribution? David Klein : Yes, so from a distribution standpoint, we've said that about 60% of our growth has come from distribution gains and in fact the beer sales team has done an outstanding job of executing against their distribution objectives for the year and now we're seeing a bit of an acceleration of our distribution growth across the portfolio. So, a majority of it is based upon the growth in distribution in the business. Rob Sands : And then to the second part of your question we're entirely unhappy and disappointed with our distribution growth because we don't have the distribution that we ought to have as a company meaning in beer and given the growth and margins to the retailer of our portfolio. So, the good news in that is we're making progress, but there is a lot of room left to go in distribution, which basically means there is a big growth runway ahead of us. Caroline Levy : Thank you. Just on the velocities, is Corona significantly higher than Modelo or visa-versa? Rob Sands : Yes, velocity? Caroline Levy : Yes. Rob Sands : Yes, Corona would have a higher velocity than Modelo, I believe, we'll double check that. David Klein : Yes, I don't have the individual brand velocities with me. Rob Sands : I don't either. Caroline Levy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Thank you, good morning. David Klein : Hey, Judy. Judy Hong : So, just, I guess couple of quick questions related to your guidance. So, when I kind of think about your depletion outlook for the balance of the year, I think it implies sort of stable growth versus what you've seen the first half of the year. The comparisons are little bit easier, you had talked about maybe a minor impact from the hurricanes, you've got the Premier launch in kind of the beginning of next year. Just so trying to get a little bit more of an understanding where the upside versus kind of the downside case in terms of depletion guidance. And then David, just in terms of the margin for the back half for beer, obviously it does employ I think something like a 36% EBIT margin. So, kind of the delta between first half versus the second half, is it mostly attributable to really the lower volume related to the seasonality of the business? David Klein : Yes, so I'll take the second one first. So, if you look at the seasonality of the business and use the last couple years of as an example, we sell about 55% to 60% of our total years beer in the first half of the year. And I think if you look at our fixed cost in our business plus from an operation standpoint plus thinking of SG&A as roughly fixed across the year and you kind of apply the seasonality against that you get a pretty reasonable drag in the back half of the year and we think that's going to be the normal seasonal cycle going forward. In addition to that this year we do have work going on at Nava and at Obregon that will result in line commissioning cost and incremental labor coming on to support the expansion. And then of course we have the continued addition of depreciation as we put assets into service. So, I think we'll when we get through this year we'll be able to outline a better seasonality model, but that's what we're expecting. And then in terms of depletions, we\u2019re -- I would say that we\u2019re pretty balanced in terms of where our guidance is because we have a -- we do have an easier overlap in particular in Q4 from a depletion standpoint with beer. At the same time we\u2019re sitting here at just over 8% depletions in Q2. So, we think that we\u2019re pretty balanced in terms of deplete forecast if you will. Judy Hong : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Laurent Grandet : Good morning everyone. I have got one follow-up from the question from Caroline about the beer segment. So could you please update us on the commercial approach to gain shelf space from slow moving competitive brands specifically craft beer and light beer? How I mean are you assessing your progress on these? And then the second one, as you are one of the best if not the best commercial -- beer commercial organization in the U.S. besides M&A could we envisage you to import or to distribute the beer from Europe or Japan to leverage better your assets in the U.S. Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes, so first on shelf space. Our increases in distribution are specifically coming from the kind of thing that you mentioned either shelf space coming from slower moving craft SKUs or slower moving domestic. As we increase our shelf space, because the overall beer shelf space I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage is growing. So, I mean that is precisely the trust and the concept and our discussion with retailers is that they can improve their growth rate and their profitability per unit shelf space by devoting more shelf space to our growth portfolio and high margin portfolio than either low margin domestic beer, or craft that is not moving. And then on your second question, imports other than our own, I would say at the moment don\u2019t [inaudible] are not very exciting to us for a couple reasons. Number one, if you look at imports as a category in the United States, I would say the vast majority if not almost all of the growth in imports with a small exception of a couple of small brands is coming from our portfolio. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a misnomer to think that the growth in the beer category to the extent that there is any is coming from imports, it is not, it is coming from Constellations portfolio of Mexican beers. And then there is also growth coming from the craft segment and that\u2019s about it. And then number two, we\u2019re uninterested, completely uninterested in taking on imports of other companies at an agency basis, in fact we gave up those imports. So we used to have brands like Ching-Dao in the portfolio and St. Pauli Girl and those were agency brands. Now the margins on that kind of business are not consistent with the kind of businesses and the kind of business that we\u2019re interested in, point number one. And then point number two, there isn\u2019t really much growth in imports from any country except Mexico and that\u2019s all coming from our portfolio and of course there is like one or two small exceptions to what I am saying. But they literally are one or two small exception.  So, hopefully that answers your question. Laurent Grandet : Yes very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much, good morning and congrats on a great performance again. Rob you\u2019ve made a great case for incremental distributions and phasings in the beer segment. And it was couple of years back that we did the big distributor realignment in wine and I think the 5% depletion growth in wine in this quarter and particularly the strong growth rates in the focus brands. It leaves me to ask the question do you have the ability to kind of ask -- under this total beverage alcohol discussion do you have the ability to go to retailers and say we\u2019re not getting fair share phasings in wine or make that case to your distribution. How do you think about that? Rob Sands : Well, I mean the answer to that is yes, especially in when you look at our focus brands and some of our most key brands, I mean the -- what you are describing and I know you know this is sort of the essence of what we call sales execution. But okay, in wine and spirits, it\u2019s slightly different than beer, although very slightly, because what I am about to say really applies all three categories. But in wine and spirits in particular because of the -- and really wine in particular because of the very, very high degree of fragmentation versus beer for argument sake. The total key is merchandising and when we talk about merchandising it\u2019s all about getting the product on the floor and advertised by the retailer with some kind of a deal, that\u2019s really the key to execution in really wine and spirits a little less so in beer where it\u2019s about getting more of that shelf, which continues to be dominated by really just a couple of companies that represent the vast majority of the market share in beer in the country, but have declining portfolios. That said, merchandising in beer is important too, getting the floor is also important but now in wine a wine bottle on a shelf is one wine bottle and one label amongst 1,000. Q - Tim Ramey : Yes. Rob Sands : And so, if you really want to have your product in danger of being purchased right, there is no better way than having a display of your product on the floor in front of the cash register and in the stores add with a discount so that consumers can easily pickup a bottle of it as they checkout at the cash register. So as I said that is the essence -- it\u2019s the essence of sales execution. Tim Ramey : So would you argue that the point of leverage is with the retailer with a discussion on total beverage alcohols, or is it I need to go back to blocking and tackling with the distributor? Rob Sands : I would say that it\u2019s both, but as far as TBA goes, total beverage alcohol, I think it\u2019s a retail story. And what I mean by that is that there is a number of facts that are extremely important that the retailer needs to understand and really probably doesn\u2019t understand and there is two facts. And I think it if you were back to school, Bill Newlands our COO and David talked about this. A very large percentage of consumers right now are shopping across all three categories at once. So they are buying wine, beer and spirits, I think the number is something like 55% of consumers are shopping and drinking across all three categories, which is far different than it used to be years ago. And so we need to address those consumers\u2019 desires and we would do that at retail by offering our TBA portfolio of premium and growing brands, that\u2019s point number to the retailer. Point number two to the retailer is almost even a more important point and that is that if a retail basket contains all three beverage alcohol products meaning beer, wine and spirits, the total value of the ring will be larger by several hundred percent than a basket that only has one category in it of the three or even two categories in it of the three. So, that's what retail is all about and the most successful retailers in the country are all about how do we increase the average size of the ring i.e., the basket as the shopper leaves the store and there probably is no better way to do that than to get the consumer to purchase all three categories. Because if I do that that consumer is going to be a very big purchaser in that store. Tim Ramey : Perfect, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Funky Buddha and just kind of the decision on that and based on kind of the learnings some Ballast Point, how might that be different, how does that lead to maybe looking at other type acquisitions I mean you had kind of taken a break from Ballast Point to this. And so just trying to understand how this might be different in terms of your thought process after having Ballast Point for couple of years? Rob Sands : Yes, that's an interesting question. And there is some very significant learnings relative to that and what we are doing with Ballast Point relates to that and how we're treating Funky Buddha also relates to that. So, I would say that when the craft beer business as a general proposition was growing at a much faster rate, the modus operandi that most craft businesses had including Ballast Point before we bought it and for a period of time after we bought it was create a whole bunch of products, throw them out, try to throw them out there everywhere and anywhere you can and see what happens and let the consumer decide. As the business has slowed down, as there is a SKU contraction going on that modus operandi really doesn't work anymore because what you found is that just putting the product out everywhere and anywhere around the country in stores that may not have a very high what we call CDI category development index, doesn't make a lot of sense because the stuff just sits on the shelf that gets old and now consumers are sort of realizing that. So, what we've done with Ballast Point is number one we're consolidating the distribution network into our gold network, that's a very important learning and very important to us Funky Buddha if and when we expanded outside of Florida that will be a key tenant number one. Number two, focusing on key SKU that are really driving the growth as oppose to overly fragmenting the portfolio and then driving or marketing against those key SKUs, marketing and promotion. Where we know that there is velocity and consumer interest that's another key learning as oppose to just putting out 50 different things. So driving this usually two or three or four key SKUs that are important. And then the third element, which is really important is not expanding geographically too quick and therefore into markets where there is no consumer awareness of the brand there is really no marketing just throwing the product out there to retailers. Because it will just sit there and won\u2019t be reordered and that's where you sort of see a bit of a slowdown. And a lot of these companies is that they are cycling through having throwing a lot out there and then finding out that it's not repeat business. So, number one with Funky Buddha, we get the beauty of being able to apply those tenants straight off the bat and therefore I would say building a stronger more consistent and more measured growth story with Ballast Point we\u2019re retreating to that approach and philosophy a bit and hence that\u2019s why you see some of the shorter term negative impact in Ballast Point, which I would say that as we move into our next fiscal, you will see us cycle that. And we\u2019re pretty hopeful that our activities there will take hold, because we have moved it to our gold network, they are extremely highly motivated to drive the brand, the liquids are award winning and fantastic. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it other than the approach that was previously taken was not I\u2019d say the kind of professional approach that we as a major company could really bring to it. So we\u2019re in that process right now and those are new learnings from our Ballast Point experience. So more to come. Bill Chappell : Thanks so much, I appreciate it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Tom Coleman of Kentico [ph]. Rob Sands : Hey, Tom. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, how are you doing? Great job, I got a question, no one has asked it, very important question. How did you guys know to stick with the New York Jet\u2019s Corona Red Zone promotion? Who figured that out, that they were going to be two in two after four weeks? Rob Sands : It\u2019s pure [indiscernible]. We\u2019re not going to go into gambling, because we probably all be arrested Tom. Unidentified Analyst : Good job, good job. Rob Sands : Because of these forward knowledge that we have of these matters. Unidentified Analyst : Exactly alright, well fantastic quarter, hope to see you guys soon. Rob Sands : Thank you. David Klein : Thanks Tom. Operator : Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay, as we close out the discussion for our second quarter results, I want to thank everyone, everyone who contributed to the strong performance of our business for the first half of the year. Though the year is far from complete, our new guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to sustain our growth momentum in the second half.  Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January, when we will share the results of our third quarter. Until then we wish you all a safe and happy holiday season, certainly in our business this time of the year is great. And it\u2019s a great opportunity to responsibly share Constellation\u2019s fine beer, wine and spirits products with friends and family. So thanks again everybody for joining our call and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

Caroline Levy - Macquarie Research William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Operator : Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Lori. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters I\u2019d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob. Robert Sands : Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. As I reflect on 2017, I am reminded that it has been a dynamic time for our business. We posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation stock increasing almost 50% for the calendar year 2017 versus the S&P 500, which grew about 20% for the year. Overall, stars, Constellation was one of the best performers among the S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks. I believe our excellent stock price performance continues to be driven by our strong financial results and the ongoing growth prospects for our business. The confidence in our future business prospects compelled us to seek board authorization for a new multiyear $3 billion share repurchase program subsequent to the recent repurchases of more than 200 million of our outstanding shares. I'm also excited about our recent investment in Canopy Growth Corporation, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. Founded in 2014 and based in Ontario, Canopy Growth is one of the earliest commercial players in Canada's legal cannabis market and has a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and currently has a market cap in the $5 billion range. This investment provides Constellation with a first-mover advantage for a potentially significant emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. Our plan is to jointly collaborate with Canopy in a number of areas. Initially, we will be learning the cannabis business and the related consumer space and route-to-market while building and developing a successful cannabis beverage business. Now recreational cannabis is scheduled to become legal in Canada this coming summer with recreational edibles including beverages expected to become legal in the summer of 2019. We have no current plans to sell cannabis products in the U.S. or any other market, and we will not consider doing so until it is legal at all levels of government. Our initial investment of approximately $190 million represents an ownership interest of 9.9% of Canopy Growth plus warrants which give Constellation the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the future. In a few moments, David will review how we are accounting for this investment. And speaking of growth prospects, we posted another great quarter for our beer business, which generated 80% of the total U.S. beer category growth and claimed four of the top 10 share-gainer positions with Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Modelo Chelada, Tamarindo Picante and Pacifico. Overall, Constellation's beer business remains the leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market and was the clear winner for the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays, with excellent execution that drove share gains led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands continue to drive the growth of the portfolio with ongoing distribution and velocity gains. Throughout the quarter, Corona Extra maintained strong media support and became the official imported beer of four NFL teams while also featuring Jon Gruden in football promotions during the season. Corona Extra also increased relevance with Hispanic consumers through its partnerships with Latin music superstars Enrique Iglesias and Man\u00e1. The Modelo Especial fighting spirit campaign continued throughout our third quarter including national TV and promotional activities during the NFL schedule. In addition, national Spanish-language TV support ran through November including a strong presence with live soccer program and top-rated Spanish language TV networks. Social media on Facebook and Instagram also supported NFL, the Mexican Independence Day and the Dia de los Muertos for this brand. Collectively, these initiatives drove depletion growth of almost 17% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for our third quarter. Pacifico continues to make its mark within our portfolio and recently was named Impact Beer Brand of the Year by Market Watch. In addition, Pacifico has become the fastest, the fastest-growing beer brand among the top 40 beer brands based on 52-week IRI dollar growth of nearly 24%. Our plans for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to evolve as we finalize our launch strategies for next year. Corona Premier is the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years, and we plan to make our largest-ever launch investment of more than 35 million to support the effort. This includes a robust media plan with general market and Spanish language TV advertising beginning in April. Additional support will include print, social media and Hispanic-targeted advertising as well as on-premise sampling and new point-of-sale materials. Corona Familiar will roll out during the same time frame to major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand. Now turning to the operations side of the beer business. During the quarter, we continued to make progress as we put the finishing touches on our Nava capacity addition to complete the 27.5 million hectoliter expansion while also nearing the finishing line with our fourth glass furnace, both of which are expected to come online in the coming months. Glass furnace three is now fully operational and running at peak efficiency levels. The Obregon brewery continues to perform at a very high utilization level, and we remain on track with our brewing and packaging capacity additions, which are expected to be completed before the end of the fiscal year. And construction continues in Mexicali with brewhouse tank fabrication and installation currently under way. During the quarter, we reached agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure and expand our contracts for glass supply including our joint venture agreement. As you know, the joint venture operates a glass production plant in Nava, Mexico and provides bottles exclusively for Constellation's adjacent brewery, which is our lowest-cost source of supply for glass. The original joint venture agreement included the expansion of the glass production plant from one furnace to four furnaces, and initial expansion plans have been progressing as scheduled, as I just mentioned. The expanded relationships with OI provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to come online by the end of calendar 2019 and will be included in our future capital investment plans. Following the installation of the fifth furnace, the Nava plant will be the largest, most modern glass container facility in the world. In recognition of the value-added contributions from both partners, the term of the joint venture agreement has also been extended for an additional 10 years to 2034. David will discuss the high-level details of this new contract in a few moments. Now turning to the wine and spirits business. It certainly has been an interesting quarter for our wine and spirits division. Early in the quarter, hurricanes hit some of our key markets. And shortly thereafter, we were faced with one of the worst natural disasters in California state history as we dealt with widespread wildfires in Northern California. Overall, we are fortunate that these events are expected to have only a minor impact in our business both near term and in the future. To put things in perspective, about 80% of the harvest was already completed when the wildfires started, and less than 5% of our wine portfolio is Napa or Sonoma appellated. Constellation has a long history in Napa and Sonoma, and we're committed to helping our neighbors and our communities rebuild by driving consumer engagement and continuing to encourage purchase and consumption of Napa and Sonoma wines. Please help us support this effort. Third quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our second quarter. Key Focus Brands drove depletion growth led by double-digit trends for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and High West Whiskey. Throughout the quarter, our focused investments for some of these brands were visible in the marketplace and drove excellent results, including the first-ever national TV advertising campaign for Kim Crawford, which drove accelerating growth trends for this brand during the key holiday selling season. Now on a year-to-date basis, the business is expanding margins, generating positive mix, driving innovation and seeing excellent results from acquired brands including Meiomi, The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West. And our innovation efforts are paying off with successes like Cooper & Thief, which has become the #2 super-luxury red blend; and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet and Chardonnay, which together are growing more than 120% in IRI channels. I'm also pleased to report that Constellation Ventures has been busy, recently making two minority investments, both of which align with our strategy of investing in emerging unique and distinctive brands. The first is The Real McCoy, a high-end rum aged in American oak bourbon barrels. This line of 3, 5 and 12 year aged rum is produced by Richard Seale, a legendary fourth-generation master distiller and made at Foursquare Distillery in Barbados. This product has a premium price point of the $20 to $50 range and uses an authentic farm-to-glass production process using high-quality blackstrap molasses with no added sugars, flavors or aromas. The second is Copper & Kings, a high-end American craft brandy founded in 2014 in Louisville, Kentucky. These brandies are naturally distilled in copper pot stills, and the liquid is matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels and retails for $35 a bottle. While the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rate versus what we anticipated when we set our original guidance estimates earlier this year. In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize our portfolio of tail brands. Despite these challenges, we are targeting wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal 2018 at the low end of our previous stated guidance ranges of 4% to 6% and 5% to 7%, respectively. Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to address the topic of tax reform. As a U.S.-based beverage alcohol company, Constellation has been supportive of tax reform that allows U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. While we continue to review the legislation, we are very pleased with the outcome of this historic legislation and believe that it'll be very positive for us going forward. David will provide additional details in a few minutes. In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the fiscal year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. We established a first-mover advantage in emerging consumer category with our Canopy Growth investment, and we continue to make smart investments including the planned addition of a fifth furnace at our glass plant in Nava. We continue to build shareholder value through ongoing share repurchases and stock appreciation driven by our strong results and future business prospects. And I am pleased with the outcome of tax reform legislation. We look forward to leveraging the opportunities that this will bring for our business and continue to thrive. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the third quarter. David Klein : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss another quarter of strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown market share, expanded margins and improved our capital structure while investing in growth initiatives that will benefit us as we go forward. Our fiscal '18 year-to-date comparable basis diluted EPS is up 29% versus last year. Q3 comparable basis diluted EPS increased 2%. The low Q3 EPS growth rate was primarily due to timing as we're increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to a range of $8.40 to $8.50 from $8.25 to $8.40. This improvement is primarily due to anticipated favorability in our full year tax rate and better margin performance in our beer business, which I'll talk about in a moment. We now expect our fiscal '18 comparable effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous 21% guidance. Our EPS and tax rate guidance excludes any impacts from recently enacted tax reform. Before I move further into our results, let me provide some comments on the new tax legislation. First of all, we're pleased with the bill that was enacted and want to thank our friends in Congress for their work to reform the corporate tax code. Like most companies, we're in the process of evaluating the specific impacts of tax reform, but it is clearly favorable to our previous low to mid-20s long-term effective tax rate guidance. For fiscal '18, we expect to benefit in our U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The new 21% corporate tax rate will apply for the last two months of our fiscal year, resulting in a lower blended statutory tax rate versus the historical 35% rate. We expect the new tax legislation, including the impact of the tax rate deduction -- or reduction and the transition to a territorial system of taxation will result in a reduction in our existing net deferred tax liabilities by $300 million to $400 million. This onetime noncash benefit will be reported in our fourth quarter fiscal '18 results and will be excluded from our comparable basis financial results. We expect to provide an update to our long-term effective tax rate guidance as part of our upcoming investor presentation at the CAGNY conference in late February. Now let's take a closer look at Q3 performance and our full year outlook, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, we continued to see strong operational performance and robust marketplace momentum. Depletion growth came in at 9% as we won the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays. This result was in line with our depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high-single digit depletion growth target for fiscal '18. Net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 6%. Depletion growth ran ahead of shipment growth primarily due to timing. Year-to-date shipments grew more than 8%, putting us on track to meet our net sales target for fiscal '18 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing benefit in our Mexican beer portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 290 basis points to 37.7% primarily due to lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits driven by glass and material sourcing along with foreign currency favorability. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $42 million for Q3. We now expect beer operating margin -- or beer operating income growth to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Although we're increasing our guidance to the upper end of our previous range, our Q4 operating margin is expected to moderate primarily due to lower seasonal production volume combined with the continued ramp-up in depreciation, line commissioning costs and headcount additions. In addition, SG&A leverage is expected to be impacted by the seasonality of the business. For wine and spirits, organic net sales were flat due primarily to mix benefits being mostly offset by lower volumes. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits from portfolio premiumization efforts were more than offset by higher COGS and marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect higher operational costs including increased transportation costs and the overlap of a supplier cost reimbursement in Q3 last year. We expect to realize benefits from the increased marketing spend on brands like Kim Crawford, Ruffino and Charles Smith over the next several quarters. For the year-to-date period, organic net sales are up 1% and operating margin has expanded 170 basis points. Excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales are up 4% and operating income grew 5% for the first 9 months of fiscal '18. For fiscal '18, when excluding Canadian wine business divestiture, we expect net sales and operating income growth rates to be at the low end of our targeted 4% to 6% and 5% to 7% ranges, respectively, for the reasons Rob mentioned. As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower-margin value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal '18 while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense increased 5% primarily due to higher average debt balances. We also continue to benefit from our investment-grade status. In October, to improve short-term borrowing costs, we implemented a commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. In November, we issued $2 billion of senior notes at attractive fixed rates and used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our variable-rate European term A loan facility. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.4x at the end of November from 3.7x at the end of fiscal '17 while we invested in our Mexican operation, our portfolio and Canopy Growth and returned cash to shareholders with $301 million worth of dividends paid and $239 million of stock repurchases during the first nine months of the year. The stock repurchases represent a little over 1.1 million shares at an average price of $213 with most of this activity occurring during the third quarter. At the end of Q3, there was $308 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, which we expect to utilize over the next several years. Our significant capital allocation flexibility allows us to continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining committed to our 3.5x leverage target. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 18.9% versus 16.4% last year. This increase reflects the overlap from recording the year-to-date impact of our election of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings under APB 23 in the third quarter of fiscal '17, partially offset by the fiscal '18 adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment award activity to be recognized in the income statement. We now expect the fiscal '18 effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 21%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings. As noted earlier, our updated guidance doesn't include any impact from tax reform. I'd also like to note for fiscal '18, we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 201 million shares and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to approximate $10 million to $15 million. As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.50. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 25% year-over-year growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. I'd like to highlight two significant comparable adjustments that occurred in Q3. The first is the $217 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy investment and Canopy warrants. This gain is primarily based upon a CAD 18.43 share price for Canopy at the end of our third quarter as compared to a CAD 12.98 share price at the time of our initial investment. The Canopy share price has moved significantly higher since the end of the third quarter as well. Going forward on a quarterly basis, we will continue to record a comparable adjustment for the change in fair value of this investment and warrants and update reported EPS guidance accordingly. Our current reported guidance assumes that the Canopy share price at the end of our fourth quarter will equal the share price at the end of our third quarter. The second is related to glass sourcing initiative highlighted by Rob, where we reached an agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure supply contracts and expand our joint venture agreements for the operation of the Nava glass plant by 10 years to 2034. The expanded relationship provides for a fifth furnace to be added at an estimated cost of $140 million. This will be financed by equal contributions from both partners and will be included in Constellation's future capital investment plans. The fifth furnace is targeted to come online at the end of calendar 2019. During Q3, we recorded a $59 million pretax charge associated with the restructuring of our agreement with OI. This initiative will result in more glass being efficiently provided to the Nava Brewery from our lowest-cost source of glass supply, providing Constellation additional opportunities for margin enhancement and a higher return on our investment. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of FY '18, we generated $763 million of free cash flow versus $824 million for the same period last year as operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexican beer operations. At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which will be effective for Constellation at the beginning of fiscal '19. Upon adoption, certain sales incentives will be recognized earlier than they are currently, and we'll make an adjustment to increase accrued expenses with an offset to retained earnings as of the end of fiscal '16. We will recast the full year of fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 along with fiscal '18 quarters. We're in the process of quantifying the changes, but we don't expect there to be a material impact to net sales. We expect to provide recast information when we file our fiscal '18 10-K. In closing, we're well positioned to deliver another year of top-tier financial performance as we close out fiscal '18, and we're excited about our financial prospects heading into fiscal '19. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : My question is on the beer division. First, David, you mentioned a number of reasons behind the expected large year-over-year decline in beer operating margins in Q4. Are those more discrete factors in Q4 causing the year-over-year compression? Are you comfortable those factors don't linger and you get back to expansion beyond Q4? And then also on the top line front in beer, can you help frame the magnitude of contribution you expect from Premier next fiscal year based on what you're seeing in test markets so far and in light of the heavy investment of more than $35 million that you mentioned earlier in the call? David Klein : Yes. Dara, so in terms of Q4 margins for beer, the real issue for us is that we haven't seen a full seasonality picture of our business really until this year because of being under the interim supply agreement prior to this. And so in Q4, it's our lowest net sales quarter of the year, so we get a bit of a delevering effect at the fixed cost line in the plant as well as on the SG&A line. And then on top of that, we're bringing in employees. So we're adding headcount in Q4 that we will be able to deploy when we get into the peak production season, and we have some line commissioning cost. So I think there's just a bit of a seasonality built in, but we're pretty confident in the margins and being able to deliver strong margins going forward. I'd also say, Dara, that we had concerns both for Q3 and Q4 about some headwinds from FX within our beer margins, but with the peso sitting around 19, we're just not seeing those headwinds this year. And then from a top line perspective, we expect the majority of the benefit from the Premier launch will be seen in Q1 of next year versus Q4 of this year, and so we simply expect to have our distributor inventory kind of at our normal 30-ish days at the end of the quarter when we get to the end of the fiscal year, which is why we expect our net sales to be in that 9% to 11% range for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Sunil Modi : Just as we kind of approach the February shelf set -- resets and obviously you're launching some new products into the marketplace, I'm just curious on what the retailers and distributors are saying in terms of incremental space because I know that's been a big initiative that you guys have been pushing for a number of years now. Can you just provide some context on kind of how it looks now and how it's changed from where you were a year ago? Robert Sands : Yes. So I think that in general, we're making good progress on our efforts to increase our space commensurate with how we're growing at retail and our contribution from a profitability point of view at retail. So we continue to see good distribution growth. And so I'd say, everything is on track. We've also made some significant organizational additions to bolster our category management activities and have brought in some really great people to continue to drive those efforts. So in general, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. But we start from a position, as I've stated a number of times, of not being where we think we should be or would like to be from a space allocation point of view at retail. David Klein : Nik, I'd also add that on a year-to-date basis, our effective points of distribution are up double digits, so we continue to do really well in gaining distribution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : So I was hoping to get your thoughts on the outlook for the beer category. The results from a category perspective despite your very good depletion growth continue to look increasingly sluggish in Nielsen. That's also mirrored in the deceleration we're seeing in PCE growth. And so with your largest market, California, transitioning to legal cannabis, how are you thinking about the overall beer category for calendar '18 and any impact from cannabis? Robert Sands : Yes. So number one, I think that we think that the beer category is fundamentally going to continue to perform as the beer category in general has been performing. It's a flat to slightly down volumetrically market with all of the growth in the market being in the high end and then the premium end, in particular, giving up shares. So I don't think we'd see anything different there as we move into calendar year 2018 or our next fiscal. And then on cannabis in California, we don't really expect to see any impact from that. I think that one of the things that people don't necessarily appreciate is that cannabis has been generally available as medical marijuana and pretty accessible to almost everybody for 16 years. And therefore, the, I'd say, official legalization on a state level of it for recreational purposes is probably a nonevent is the truth of the matter. And then also, as we track what everybody else is tracking and we look at the numbers, we really can't see any real impact in terms of how it's affecting beverage alcohol in general even in the states -- or now six states, including California where it's been legalized. So as, I guess, I've said in the past, it's probably not worth getting into a big debate right now about whether it's cannibalistic or complementary. There's just not enough information, I think, to really say how that's going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward. What we do know is it's going to be a big market, however, worldwide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Just following on the last question. I'm wondering if you could give us any details or further details on your plans in Canada in terms of building out a sales team there, the sort of products you will be looking to develop or codevelop and kind of the general strategy. And I understand this is very early days and it's still very much a learning process, but would just love to get a sense of how you're thinking about it and what sort of investments on the ground that you'd be looking to put in place and thoughts on route-to-market. Robert Sands : Yes. So we are making investments. We have started building an organization in Canada. I'd characterize it more as a marketing organization than a sales organization because our partner, Canopy, has a sales organization and will continue to build their sales organization as well, and we expect to partner with them. But we have put a team in place to work with Canopy generally in evolving a lot of what they do in terms of consumer research, marketing, a lot of the standard sort of CPG stuff that we have a fairly deep knowledge and expertise in. And they, as a newer company, really focused on a totally emerging category and anticipated extremely high growth, haven't become fully developed in yet. So we've got our team working with their team, and we expect to attack that market together really when, in our case, beverages become legal, which is either going to be with the initial recreational legalization in 2018 or in 2019. I think the sort of the -- right now, the official government stance is that edibles will come in 2019, but it's kind of unclear whether they're lumping beverages into that or what they might do in 2018. So the best guess we have right now or the official word is probably beverages in 2019. And then in terms of what we're developing with Canopy, it is, as it relates to Constellation, beverages, nonalcoholic beverages which would include cannabis, so -- or be infused with cannabis. So we're working on the development of those products and things like branding, et cetera, at this time. But given sort of the time frame, we don't have everything fully baked nor should we or would we at this point in time as to exactly what the product is in terms of flavors, in terms of packaging, in terms of branding. Canopy's got a strong brand of its own even currently, which uses in the medical marijuana side of the business called Tweed, T-W-E-E-D, and I think that brand has a lot of potential as well. Robert Ottenstein : Great. And just following up on that, what sort of organization would you need in Qu\u00e9bec? Robert Sands : Well, we haven't really, I'd say, gotten that far that we're thinking about organizations by province. But as I said, in terms of like a larger sales organization, that will really be done through Canopy as it specifically relates to Canada. So I wouldn't see us building a huge sales organization necessarily, but we will build some significant capabilities and make some investments next year. David Klein : Yes. So Robert, when we provide guidance for the year on our next call, we'll talk about investments in cannabis. But clearly, there will be some. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Just had a couple of follow-up questions, David, I guess, on the comments on tax. One was just I wanted to clarify the benefit that you're expecting. Is that relative to the fiscal '18 20% rate? Or is it benefit relative to your long-term guidance on tax rate? David Klein : Well, Bryan, what we said in the script was that it would be beneficial to the low to mid-20s kind of long-term guidance rate. But we'll have a lot more specifics when we get to CAGNY because, as you can imagine, it's complicated even to understand what's in the regs as well as working through how to apply it to our business. But I can say that we're pretty confident that it's going to be below the long-term guidance and likely in line with the 20% rate that we threw out for the remainder of this year or for this year. Bryan Spillane : And then do you think that it will have a positive effect on free cash flow? So as you kind of look at cash taxes, cash tax rates, any sense yet as to -- in terms of whether there's a real tangible cash benefit that you'd expect to receive? David Klein : So again, we're still working through this. But before we said -- we provided guidance on an effective tax rate and we said that the cash tax rate would be somewhere around 500 basis points less than that while we're continuing to amortize some of our intellectual property over time. We suspect that, that will actually expand a little bit from 500 basis points, but we haven't -- we don't have final answers. We'll have those in several weeks at CAGNY. Bryan Spillane : But there's a chance that, that relationship between your cash tax rate and your new lower effective tax rate would be maintained? David Klein : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial. Mark Swartzberg : A question on wine and spirits, Rob, but just as a point of information, this group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana points out that alcohol consumption has risen in Colorado post legalization. There's a lot of just really useful data there, I found. But wine and spirits, your year-to-date organic revenue was like plus 1%. Your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 target is mid-single digits annually, and I hear you on the SKU rationalization. But how are you thinking about what's necessary to deliver that mid-single digits? Or do you think the mid-single digits is too high? Robert Sands : Well, what we expect is mid-single net sales growth for the year. That was our initial guidance range, and we feel pretty confident given sort of where we are right now, and how fourth quarter will go that we will be in that range. Year-to-date, we're about 4% growth on net sales, excluding the impact of Canada, so -- the Canada sales, so we feel pretty good. The market has slowed down a little bit, probably 100 basis points to 200 basis points versus where we thought the market would be for the year. That's probably the biggest factor that's impacting us relative to where we are in our range. We said that we think that we're more towards the low end than the high end of the range. It's probably the market that's impacting that. Lower end wines below premium seem to be being impacted, which actually could turn out to be good news. Because I think we continue to see an acceleration of premiumization, and we're seeing all of the growth really in the wine business starts to coalesce around price points which are substantially higher than they have been in the past. It used to be sort of the $8 to $12 range, and now we're seeing very strong growth, which is I'm sure hurting the lower end, between the $15 and $20 price points, which is still well within the commercial segments of the business. And we are particularly well positioned in some of those price points, and we'll continue to focus on those price points. And so over the last several years, we've become much more focused not in so much on that $8 to $12, but now in the $15 to even plus $20 range, where we think all of the growth is going to be in the future. We expect the wine category in general, there's a little bit of a slowdown in the second half of this year. As I said, could be a couple of 100 basis points. We think that the category will continue to be one of the faster or fastest-growing consumer products categories, outperforming consumer products in general. Year -- the whole -- the growth rate's been mid-single digits, almost 4%. We were at 4%. So we prefer to be at the high end of the range than the low end of the range, but we don't see anything happening here that is unusual or should constitute any kind of a warning sign. And in fact, as I said, the kind of growth we're seeing at the higher end of the commercial premium range, $15 to $20, I'd say is extremely encouraging for a lot of brands in our portfolio in particular. Mark Swartzberg : I could have been clearer. I was thinking about your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 objective of mid-single digits. And in the current fiscal year, you're getting about 300 basis points from acquisitions, so the underlying business is doing a 1%. So I was really thinking about, is it just keeping up the pace of acquisitions because, mid-single digits is not how your business is growing on an organic basis? Robert Sands : Yes. I would say that the -- excluding acquisitions, the underlying business has been a bit softer than we'd like to see it. And the numbers that you quoted are essentially correct, but I don't think that we see the short term or the quarter really being indicative of anything. And in fact, it's probably just timing, whether we're talking about the market or whether we're talking about our business overall, which we expect to be in line with those numbers that you quoted, mid-single digits. David Klein : Yes, we don't think we need to continue to add to the portfolio to hit those numbers. We expect that our portfolio can hold or grow share as it stands. Mark Swartzberg : And so do you think you can get margin expansion next year if you want that lift in organic growth? Robert Sands : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Eunjoo Hong : So on the $3 billion share buyback announcement, it's a multiyear program. So it seems to leave you still with plenty of room for additional cash usage, especially with your free cash flow stepping up in fiscal '19 and with some other tax benefits also accruing. So I guess I'm just wondering why the board came up with this number. And to the extent that you don't have a big M&A opportunity, do you think that you can complete the program earlier than you expected? Just kind of thoughts around that program. David Klein : Yes. So Judy, we asked the board for the authorization so that we can be opportunistic, and we didn't want a necessarily a time horizon on it. And so they gave us a multiyear authorization, which is consistent with the way that we've always done it in the past. As we said before, after we've invested in our -- for our expansion needs, in particular in beer, it's our intent to keep the business somewhere in that 3.5x leverage ratio range, and we'll do that through returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and then some M&A activity that's probably looks a lot like the M&A activity we've done over the past few years. So I would say that we were looking for flexibility in the multiyear repurchase and will be opportunistic. Eunjoo Hong : Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on beer depletion. Can you comment at all on the December trend? Just because obviously, last year, we had a pretty weak December, and just wanted to see if you get -- you have any color just in terms of what you saw this December. Robert Sands : You're talking beer, right? Eunjoo Hong : Yes, beer. Robert Sands : Yes, we're expecting a pretty strong fourth quarter on beer depletions is the bottom line. David Klein : And December is performing in line with us getting to that strong quarter, so we're comfortable. Robert Sands : I would say in general, our beer depletions are pretty much right where we expected them to be and right where they should be, sort of around that 10% number. So it's good. It's good. The quarter -- this quarter, it was 9.1%. We're expecting a strong fourth quarter in beer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I just I want to stay on this topic, just in terms of depletions versus shipments. And certainly recognize, there's usually some seasonality, timing differences, but there's still a decent delta between the two during this quarter, and even the last quarter or two. So could you help us better understand the dynamic? And are these two then tracking more closely right now? Or is there still a pretty big delta? And then curious if you could comment on the end or consumer demand, and how you expect this to progress throughout the year given the planned marketing campaigns that you mentioned as well as your new innovation. Robert Sands : So in the quarter, shipments were below depletions quite considerably, I think around 6% versus 9%. That would be entirely a timing-of-shipment matter, and we don't expect that delta to be anything like that as we approach the year-end. Year-to-date ships are up 8.4%, and depletions are up 9.5%. So on the year-to-date, we're seeing it a lot closer. But definitely third quarter, there was a timing-of-shipment matter that -- and I say matter, there's nothing unusual. It's just that shipments lagged a little bit more than usual behind depletions in third quarter, but we don't expect that to be a trend or that there'd be anything -- or that there's anything unusual. I mean, it could be how we ship in the last day. I mean, so it's not -- there's nothing going on there. And then your other question, Bonnie? Bonnie Herzog : Just trying to get a sense of the current consumer demand right now. You have touched on that with the previous question, but I'm more curious how you expect that to progress throughout the year. Robert Sands : If you're talking about [indiscernible] business, we think that it's very strong. And that would be evidenced by the very strong measured consumer takeaway with IRI, for instance, which is -- was more like at 16.5% for the quarter. So we don't see any issue with the consumer whatsoever. In fact, consumer takeaway is very strong right now especially in the measured channels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research group. Timothy Ramey : I kind of wanted to press on the tax issue, not from the perspective on what it will do to your rate. But particularly in the wine industry, there's a lot of goodies there for the industry. And since many of your competitors or most of your competitors are privately held, do you expect this will sort of fall to the bottom line in perhaps accelerated promotion or maybe leaving prices alone when -- because you'll have a margin benefit? How do you think this will play through the market, is kind of the thrust of my question. Robert Sands : Well, for us, I would say that we would plan on letting sort of the... Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. There will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. The conference will resume momentarily. [Technical Difficulty]. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: We're back online. Operator : Yes, you may resume the call. Robert Sands : I got cut off in mid-sentence, but I was answering Tim's question, and he was asking about the effect of tax reform in general on the industry. And what I was saying was that it was going to be -- we believe it's going to be positive. People are going to have more money in their pocket. And we think that certainly, as it relates to premium products, that's going to be very healthy for the industry. So all good news. No bad news on that front. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : David, if I could, I want to come back to -- I think it was Dara's original question on beer margins for Q4 and just reframe it in sequential terms versus Q3. I think your comments on seasonality implies some lessening P&L leverage in Q4. But by my math, your Q4 -- your implied Q4 guidance really doesn't show any falloff in sales versus Q3. So could you just maybe bridge the difference between Q3 and Q4 as you see it? I know you mentioned some hiring ahead of kind of first half '19 demand. But was there anything else going on? Because I guess depreciation comes at -- continues to ramp, so I get that. But on the other side, the peso seems cooperative. Glass benefit should continue to build, I would assume, and so on. So is it really just the incremental hiring that forms the delta between Q3 and Q4? Or is there something else? David Klein : So it's all of the above. So it's incremental depreciation as we bring more assets online. It's continued line commissioning costs, again, as we bring assets online. And remember, once we put something into production, the incremental costs go through the P&L as opposed to getting capitalized. We're hiring employees. I think we have like 100 employees that we're bringing in, production employees in Q4 to be prepared for the ramped up production season. And then there is historically in this year, there is seasonality at the net sales level in the beer business. So again, we're not expecting -- we're not -- I don't want to sit here and really apologize for the margins in the fourth quarter. I'm just suggesting that the margins will be a little bit lighter than they were in say, Q2 when we hit an all-time high. But understanding where we're going to end up with the margins is actually why we took up our guidance in -- or at least tightened the guidance to the top end of the EBIT growth range year-over-year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I'd like to follow up on the beer volumes commentary. I just wanted to clarify. Did you mean that the fourth quarter shipment will be more in line with depletions or just for the year as you do the year-to-date? As you correctly pointed out, the difference year-to-date is definitely narrower. But you're talking about fourth quarter coming up to be obviously, catching up with depletions and with shipments against depletions accelerating above shipments, accelerating above depletions to match the year-to-date. And then I'd also would like to follow up on the capital structure. Is your new buyback plan an indication that the uses of capital will be more heavily weighted on towards cash return to shareholders or compared to strategic M&A? David Klein : So on the billings and depletions kind of alignment, first of all, in terms of -- at the end of the year, we'll deplete and ship about the same number of cases. The percentages will be off a little bit just because of the starting point from last year. But we -- I think the best way to do your math is to come back in line with the 9% to 11% net sales growth and the 1% to 2% pricing algorithm, kind of putting you in the very high-single digits in net sales. And again, that's kind of where we are year-to-date on the depletions basis. In terms of capital structure, Andrea, I would say that what the authorization represents is that we're getting closer to the time where we have more and more free cash flow to deploy, and we're saying that we're going to use that in all the ways we have before. But clearly, we're going to buy back a lot of our stock because we continue to believe that the company is undervalued. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Caroline Levy : My question's around Corona, your flagship brand. If you could talk about what the trends were like in the last quarter, in the third quarter, and how you're thinking about potential cannibalization with Corona Premier or with Familiar on your existing brand. Is that something you're going to be watching very closely, where you don't want to see your flagship Corona dip, even if it is a positive margin trade? So just to talk a little bit about how should we be thinking about that April launch. Robert Sands : Yes. So we think Corona remains healthy, very healthy in fact, given its maturity. It was up about 3% in the quarter. David Klein : Beer [ph] depletions, right? Robert Sands : Yes, on depletions. And that's pretty consistent with where it's tracking, so we see good growth there and good continued growth. Now Corona is the most -- Corona Extra per se is the most mature of the brands in the portfolio. But given its state of maturity and the large market shares it has in particular places, we think it's doing very well, and we think that it will continue to do well. And then you asked about Premier, and I think that your question was on cannibalization. And yes, I mean, we're looking at that. We tested it. The cannibalization was probably less than we thought that it would be in fact, which was encouraging. The cannibalization is not a problem per se because it's not a lower-margin product. But we, nevertheless, wanted everything to be more at -- we want one plus one to add up to three, which is what all indications were in our test market. So yes, we'll be looking at the cannibalization, but you can imagine that it's two different consumers to a certain degree, meaning the people that are going to be attracted to a Premier are going to be people who are already drinking some version of a light and low-carbohydrate beer, like a Mich Ultra, okay. And people that are drinking Corona are obviously doing so without regard to it being not a light or low-carbohydrate beer. So just logically, we don't expect there to be a lot of cannibalization there. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William Chappell : I'll try to do two quick ones. One, just follow up on tax. I understand you're still trying to figure out the final benefit. But has there been any discussion from the board of the company of kind of how much of that will be spent back or reinvested? Or how you would spend the extra money in your pocket? And then my other question, just on the business. Any kind of update on on-premise and kind of how that's trending? We heard from different sources that there've been a lot of taps added for craft and all types of brands on-premise. And it seems maybe, you're not getting the volume terms, and so maybe there's some reversal there. So if you could you give us some update there, that would be great. David Klein : So in terms of tax, unlike a lot of companies that had -- that are sitting on piles on cash overseas and they're looking for something to do with it in the next several months, our situation's a little different in that we've already heavily invested the cash that we generated overseas into things like our breweries in Mexico as well as our Canopy investment in Canada. And so for us, I think the cash flow benefits that we think accrue over time get deployed along the lines of the rest of our -- or our previously stated capital allocation strategy, which is continue to invest in the business, return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and occasionally where we can get in a growth accretive and ROIC accretive sort of M&A transaction, we'll look at that as well. So I would say that, that piece doesn't change. And then in terms of on-premise, our beer business continues to do really well, I think for the last -- this quarter, we're up high single digits. I think that's been a consistent trend over the last several quarters. And so we're just seeing continued strong performance of our brands and the brands in the on-premise, even while during the same time, overall trends in the on-premise have been down, call it low single digits. Operator : I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Robert Sands : Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We certainly -- we apologize for the line going dead for a few minutes, but we rectified that. I would say that our business has performed exceptionally well for the first nine months of fiscal '18, and we are very confident that we'll continue to sustain our profitable growth by executing on our TBA premiumization strategy. Just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Prior to that, we look forward to seeing many of you at the Beer Industry Summit conference in a couple of weeks and at the CAGNY conference in late February, where we'll be providing updates on our strategic business initiatives. So thanks again, everybody, for joining the call, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks Maria. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year end fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob. Robert Sands : Thanks Patty. Good morning and welcome to our year end call. Fiscal 2018 marked another year of excellent execution and impressive results for Constellation that generated EPS growth of almost 30%. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've achieved industry-leading EPS growth of more than 20%, an accomplishment of which I am very proud. I believe it's worth reviewing some of the key accomplishments that drove this result, as they illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2019. Throughout the year, we made value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high end beverage alcohol brands. This included our acquisition of Schrader Cellars, a highly rated portfolio of fine wines sourced from Napa Valley, Vineyards that sell for $225 to $250 per bottle to customers on its mailing list as well as Funky Buddha, a regional craft brewer in South Florida, where it is the largest craft brewery by size and volume. Each of these additions boast award-winning, high end products and excellent growth prospects. These activities were complemented by Constellation Ventures' investments, including the Real McCoy, a high-end rum, Aging American Oak bourbon barrels as well as Copper & Kings, a high end American-craft brandy that is naturally distilled in copper pot stills and matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels. I'm also excited about our investment in Kennedy Growth, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. This investment provides Constellation with the first mover advantage for a potentially significant, emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. From an operational perspective, we made planned strategic investments in our beer business and completed the next expansion phases of our Nava and Obregon breweries, which collectively now provide 31.5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity for our fast growing beer business. We also fired up furnace number four at our Nava glass plant, which is already showing excellent performance as we begin to optimize its efficiencies. We recently launched our fit for growth initiative, which is a multiyear program designed to prioritize resources across the company in support of our most critical growth opportunities. And we promoted Bill Newlands to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. In this expanded role, Bill has oversight and accountability for all operating aspects of the company. I look forward to working closely with Bill to execute our growth agenda. Overall, our strong financial results and record operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 created flexibility that enabled value creating investments to support the ongoing growth of our business. And we returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through a combination of significant share repurchases and a sizable dividend increase. Collectively, these accomplishments helped us remain one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Let's move now to the excellent business performance that I just mentioned as a critical component to our success. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth, with its winning streak of 31 quarters of consecutive growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beers in the U.S. market. Constellation also remains the number one high end beer company and growth contributor to the U.S. beer category, outperforming the overall U.S. beer industry and all key competitors. As we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2019, let's begin our discussion with Corona Extra and Modelo Especial brand families, which drove strong execution and sales increases throughout the past year. Corona Extra achieved record case volumes in fiscal 2018 and has steadily been growing base velocity for five consecutive years. It has gained share every month throughout the past year, and it is the only top five beer brand that is in growth mode. And with Hispanics, Corona Extra continues to have the highest brand awareness, certainly signs of a very, very healthy brand. The Corona brand family closed out fiscal 2018 with strong growth momentum supported by strong TV, video and social media marketing and advertising activities. Corona Familiar gained distribution following its regional expansion of 12-bottle packages in the key states and became the number three high end share gainer. And Corona Premier prepared to launch nationwide with the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years. We are well-positioned in fiscal 2019 with a great lineup of activities to support the growth, momentum of this brand family. Corona Extra kicks off a new sponsorship as the official cerveza of the San Francisco Giants and will become the official import beer of this year's Kentucky Derby. English and Spanish language national TV campaigns will be launched to support the brand with this year's increased media investments focused on sports properties. New TV ads featuring Corona Extra and Corona Light together will begin running in advance of the Cinco de Mayo holiday and we will begin launching our new TV ad campaigns in support of the Premier and Familiar lunches beginning next month. Now moving to Casa Modelo, this trio of brands, which includes Modelo Especial, Negra and Chelada, has been an amazing growth story, quadrupling to more than 110 million cases in 10 years, making this brand family the number one source of growth in the entire U.S. beer category for the past decade. In fiscal 2018, Modelo Especial alone achieved the 100 million case milestone and grew depletions 17%. Modelo Especial was the fastest-growing draft in the on-premise channel and the number two share gainer in the off-premise last year. It's now a top five beer brand in 11 major U.S. markets, including New York, D.C., and Denver. And even more impressive, Modelo Especial is now the number one beer in the State of California, fueled by its number one position in L.A. and San Francisco. Last year, Modelo Especial had the highest increase in household penetration in the entire U.S. beer category. Casa Modelo has plenty of upside from ongoing distribution expansion opportunities in the coming year. Dedicated media spend will increase by more than 20% in fiscal 2019, which will be heavily weighted the high profile programming on ESPN and other entertainment networks as well as live sports property, such as the NFL and the NBA. And as of January 1st, Modelo became the official beer for the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is one of the fastest-growing sports in America. Last year, the Modelo Chelada family grew almost 40%, with the launch of Tamarindo Picante, which became the number one single-serve item in the U.S. beer market and propelled the Chelada family to greater than 30% market share of the Chelada category. Modelo Chelada Especial was also awarded the prestigious Nielsen's Breakthrough Innovation Award of 2017, a feat that only 18 brands achieved from a pool of more than 4,500 new CPG items. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. In fiscal 2018, Pacifico was the second fastest growing major beer brand in the U.S. beer category and a top 15 share gainer and we believe it has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business. In fiscal 2019, we are executing a national launch of the Pacifico 12-pack can to build on the success of the 24-ounce SKU. The 12-pack can format will be a big part of Pacifico's first ever National Cinco de Mayo retail program and we are launching our first ever national TV campaign and our largest retail programs in the history of this brand. As such, you'll see Pacifico on high profile programs, like the Walking Dead as well as NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball, and college football. And Pacifico will, once again, be the official beer sponsor of the Burton U.S. Open of snowboarding as well as the Summer X Games, two of the largest and best known action sport events in this country. In addition to Corona Premier and Familiar, I'm also very excited about the new product lineup we've planned for 2019. We are introducing Western Standard, a barrel finished easy drinking lager that will be available in three test markets this summer at a high end price point. We are leveraging the equity and authenticity of our high end, small batch, high west whiskey brand and building up trends of craft spirits and barrel-aged beverages, which we're seeing in the wine and spirits space. We believe that this is the trend for the next American beer, sessionability, yet favorable. Another segment we are excited about is the ABA space. This is a growing market opportunity, and it's incremental to the beer category. Specta-spiked premium seltzer will be introduced in three flavors and is made from natural ingredients and contains no artificial flavors. At 100 calories, it is targeted as the female consumer, who is looking for better-for-you, right options that fit an attractive and active lifestyle. We plan to begin test marketing this summer. We will also begin test marketing Corona Refresca, a premium spiked refresher in two tropical flavors that are very, very refreshing. Our craft and specialty portfolio continues to stabilize. Last fall, we launched Ballast Point, Phantom IPA and recently began a national rollout of Phantom IPA draft. This new brand is already the third-best selling craft brand in our portfolio. Now, throughout fiscal 2019, we plan to continue our Ballast Point distributor transition to the Gold Network, drive focus around and across our core brands, deliver innovation and leverage our new tasting rooms to build stronger, local brand presence. Funky Buddha will continue to expand distribution in select new markets and we have a series of new product launches planned throughout the year. From a beer operations perspective, I've mentioned earlier that our current Nava and Obregon expansion projects have been completed as planned. As we evaluated our plans for fiscal 2019, including the future growth prospects of our beer portfolio, it became clear that we would need to expand capacity beyond what we have already planned due to the industry-leading growth being generated by the business. As such, we plan to increase our Nava footprint to 30 million hectoliters and expand Obregon by an additional 5 million hectoliters, while also continuing the buildout of Mexicali to 5 million hectoliters. Collectively, these projects will provide about 44 million hectoliters of capacity by fiscal 2023. We are in the enviable position of being the growth leader in the U.S. beer industry and these investments represent smart usage of our cash. David will discuss the magnitude and timing of these capital investments in just a few minutes. Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2019. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business through enhanced distribution, excellent execution opportunities, and consumer-driven innovation across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range in the coming year. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved significant margin improvement for the year, while gaining market share in the U.S. wine category. These results demonstrate that our wine and spirits premiumization strategy is working. Our brand investment strategy is driving positive mix and margin enhancement and we are winning in the marketplace as evidenced by our market share gains. These successes combined with our operational initiatives are contributing to operating leverage in the P&L. These results were primarily driven by our fast growing; higher margin Focus Brands, which grew depletions almost 7% for the year. Many of these Focus Brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year. Several of our Focus Brands received impact 2017, Hot Brand Awards, including Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Nobilo. Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group 2017 Awards, where five of our brands achieved fast-track status recognizing their impressive growth, including Black Box, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Nobilo, and the Prisoner. 14 of our brands were named rising stars and seven listed as established growth brands. Casa Noble took top spot multiple tequila categories in cigar and spirits, the best of 2017, while whiskey advocate named High West Campfire, one of the top 20 whiskeys of 2017. Now, from an operational perspective, we have improved our cost of goods sold management capabilities. We are using enhanced consumer insights to ensure that we are spending our COGS dollars on product attributes that are valued by consumers. We were also driving asset utilization to improve ROIC by getting the right fruit of the right vineyards for each brand, including international sourcing. We have improved yields as a result of process optimization and value engineering throughout the entirety of the production process and we've engaged in packaging simplification and optimized our production footprint. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2019, we are focused on delivering against select key objectives. We will continue to execute a steady evolution to the high end of the U.S. wine and spirits category by capturing growth at higher price points to achieve mix and margin benefits, particularly at the greater than $11 price point at retail. This includes driving growth from our Focus Brands, which grew almost seven times the rate of the entire portfolio last year and represents approximately 70% of the profit of the wine and spirits business. We have plans to accelerate our consumer-led innovation and brand-building efforts. As such, we're focusing on capitalizing on hot trend opportunities, like ros\u00e9, creating higher price points with cross category innovation and developing new brands like, DERANGE, which is a red blend that retails for $100 per bottle. It's actually one of my personal new favorites. We are excited about the innovation brands we have currently launched and are planning to launch this coming year, including 7 Moons, SVEDKA Blue Raspberry Vodka, Cooper & Thief, especially the Sauvignon Blanc aids in Casa Noble tequila barrels and Black Box spirits, including whiskey, vodka and tequila, will be introduced in a phased rollout beginning this quarter. These collective efforts will be supported by impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build new and existing brands. We will continue to evolve our three-tiered e-commerce TBA strategy as well as our direct-to-consumer initiative as we clear plans to drive growth from these channels. And we have a long runway to continue to improve our operational capabilities in forecasting, asset utilization, flexibility, and throughput. Overall, we will continue to optimize our route-to-market strategy, revenue management, sales enablement, and operational processes. As I mentioned last quarter, while we have seen a slowdown in the U.S. wine industry, it has stabilized and remains healthy overall, with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth. In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize a subset of our portfolio of tail brands to simplify and premiumize the overall portfolio. Ultimately, we are committed to growing our wine and spirits business -- businesses ahead of the U.S. wine and spirits industry, while targeting margin expansion from ongoing price mix benefits and cost of goods activities. In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong, strong financial, commercial, and operational performance. In 2018, we delivered industry-leading market results from our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits businesses, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and wine market share gains. We are very, very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I'm pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase and an enhancement to our dividend payout ratio in the coming year. With all of that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2018 and provide our outlook for fiscal 2019. David Klein : Thanks Rob and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2018 was another tremendous year, as we continue to generate top tier growth in the CPG space. We generated over $7.5 billion of net sales and 7% organic net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 270 basis points. We increased comparable basis EBIT by 13%. We increased comparable basis diluted EPS by 29%, which follows the 24% EPS growth we generated in fiscal 2017. And we produced over $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which is an increase of 14%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth provided us with significant financial flexibility, as we continue to make capital investments in our Mexican beer operations, return cash to shareholders with more than $1 billion in stock repurchases and $400 million of dividend payments, while making investments in canopy growth and brands like Schrader and Funky Buddha. The stock repurchases represent 4.8 million shares at an average price of $216. Approximately, 75% of the repurchases occurred during the fourth quarter, as we believed the benefits of U.S. Tax Reform and our top line growth prospects were not appropriately being appreciated by the market. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finished at 3.6 times versus 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017. We expect fiscal 2019 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis diluted EPS, and operating cash flow growth. While we continue to invest in our Mexican beer operations, our brands and in other areas in order to capture future growth opportunities. In addition, we're increasing our dividend by more than 40% and our dividend payout ratio to 30%, while we remain committed to our 3.5 times leverage ratio target. Let's look at fiscal 2018 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales grew 10%, primarily due to volume growth of 9% in favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10%. Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 39.5%. We're extremely pleased with this operating margin performance, which we believe is best-in-class for North American brewing. The margin increase was driven primarily by lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect strong operational performance, driven by glass and material sourcing benefits, foreign currency favorability, and supply independence from ABI. These benefits were partially offset by a $54 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $168 million for fiscal 2018. For wine and spirits, excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales increased by 5%. This includes 3% organic growth, driven primarily by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volumes, along with the acquisition benefits from the Charles Smith, High West, and Prisoner brands. Total U.S. depletions grew 1% for the year, while our Focus brand portfolio posted 7% depletion growth. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 160 basis points to 27.4%. This improvement primarily reflects mix benefits from the portfolio premiumization efforts, including the Canadian wine business divestiture, partially offset by marketing investments in higher COGS. As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower margin value brand SKUs. These actions impacted wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal 2018 while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense for the year decreased slightly to $332 million as the benefit of lower average interest rates was mostly offset by higher average borrowings. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 19% versus 26.8% last year. This reflects an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings in the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. The fiscal 2018 rate also benefited from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for the last two months of the fiscal year. Now, let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.90, up 28%. Beer net sales increased 12%, primarily due to volume growth of 10% in favorable pricing. Beer operating margin remains steady at 38%, as pricing, along with operational and foreign currency benefits, were mostly offset by higher SG&A, including increased marketing spend for the quarter. Wine and spirits organic net sales increased 8%. This primarily reflects mix benefits, driven largely by strong sales of the Meiomi wine brand, which experienced tight supply in Q4 last year as strong consumer demand outpaced expectations. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27.4%, as benefits of favorable mix were partially offset by higher COGS in marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect the impact of lower volumes for the quarter and the overlap of certain inventory cost benefits in Q4 of fiscal 2017. In Q4, we recognized an additional $236 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the canopy investment and warrants, bringing the total pretax gain on this investment to $453 million. We recorded a net tax benefit of $363 million as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, which is comprised of a benefit from a reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time transition tax related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. And we also wrote down $19 million of bulk inventory -- bulk wine inventory due to smoke damage sustained form the California wildfires. We are pursuing insurance reimbursements for this loss. These items were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. Moving to fiscal 2018 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $874 million compared to $789 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.9 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our earnings growth; and CapEx totaled $1.1 billion, which was 17% above last year's spend. The CapEx in below our previous expectations due to timing. Moving to our full year fiscal 2019 P&L and free cash flow outlook. For fiscal 2019, we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we're projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.70 per share. The midpoint of this guidance has us growing EPS by approximately 10%. Our beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth in the range of 9% to 11%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. In fiscal 2019, we expect to see gross margin improvement, primarily from product pricing as benefits from glass sourcing initiatives and operational efficiencies are expected to be offset by increased depreciation. Looking closer at depreciation expense for the beer segment, it totaled $168 million in fiscal 2018. We expect that to increase by approximately 30% in fiscal 2019. We expect gross margin benefits to be mostly offset by incremental marketing investments in support of our innovation and other growth initiatives. These investments include $35 million for the national launch of Corona Premier as well as a regional expansion of the 12-ounce format of Corona Familiar. We're also rolling out our first-ever national advertising for Pacifico to drive awareness across the U.S. and supporting other programs like the Modelo Especial UFC sponsorship. The additional marketing spend in fiscal 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year as we prepare for the upcoming Cinco de Mayo holiday and the summer selling season. Beer marketing as a percent of revenue finished fiscal 2018 at approximately 9% and the additional marketing spend that I outlined for fiscal 2019 could move that percentage up by 50 to 100 basis points. For the wine and spirits business, for fiscal 2019, we expect net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. For sales, we're targeting low single-digit volume growth and continued mix benefits from our premiumization efforts. We expect mixed benefits and COGS productivity enhancements to be mostly offset by some cost increases, including higher grade and transportation cost and technology-focused SG&A investments, which will create operating efficiencies as we go forward. I'd like to remind everyone, from a first quarter standpoint, that in Q1 fiscal 2018, wine and spirits EBIT grew 22% and U.S. shipment volumes significantly outpaced depletions. This was driven by replenishment of Meiomi supplier, which was constrained coming out of Q4 fiscal 2017. As a result, our Q1 fiscal 2019 wine and spirits EBIT could be down 10% to 15%, with sales down low to mid-single-digits. This first quarter was contemplated when we set our guidance of 2% to 4% growth on the topline and bottom-line in our wine and spirits business. Shifting back to the full year fiscal 2019, to be clear, we are planning to expand operating margins in both business segments. However, we expect the deltas between sales and operating income growth to be contained within the range as provided. As I mentioned at the recent CAGNY Investor Conference, we've begun a multiyear program to make us fit for growth, whereby we will reengineer our business processes and implement a company-wide ERP platform to create better digital connectivity with our consumers and our customers. For fiscal 2019, in our corporate segment, we're planning approximately $20 million of incremental spend related to digital enablement activities, like the ERP platform I just mentioned and e-commerce initiatives as well as investments in personnel and resources to build brands and open new markets in support of our cannabis investment. These initiatives should help us stay ahead of trends to meet the needs of the perpetually evolving consumer. Let's transition to our tax rate where we are pleased with the overall net benefit resulting from U.S. Tax Reform, which will primarily be reinvested to support the long-term growth of our business. We expect our tax rate to approximate 19%, which is in line with our new 18% to 20% medium term effective tax rate. As a reminder, we were targeting a low to mid-20% tax rate prior to tax reform. While the year-over-year tax rate is expected to be flat, fiscal 2019 reflects the anticipated benefit from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily offset by an increased in our effective rate on foreign earnings, which will occur due to the adoption of ASU 2016-16. Under this accounting change, we will record a deferred tax asset at the beginning of fiscal 2019 for the future tax amortization of certain intangible assets. As a result of this amortization, we expect our cash tax rate to run at least 700 basis points lower than our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2019, our tax payments are also expected to be reduced by prior year refunds. As a result, we expect our fiscal 2019 cash tax rate to be almost 10 percentage points below our effective tax rate. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at 197 million. For clarity, our guidance assumes no share repurchases during fiscal 2019. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion and CapEx of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. This includes approximately $900 million of CapEx for our Mexican beer operation expansion, including investments in Obregon, Mexicali, Nava, and the fifth glass furnace. We expect to finish fiscal 2019 with approximately 34 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which was effective for Constellation at the beginning of 2019. Under the new guidance, we'll recognize certain sales incentives earlier than we have historically. This change will shift net sales recognition between our fiscal quarters, but is not expected to have a material impact on full year net sales. We'll recast full year fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, along with fiscal 2018 quarters and provide this information in connection with our first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. In closing, we believe we're well-positioned to continue to deliver best-in-class topline growth over the long-term. Our fiscal 2018 results, along with the growth-focused investments we are making while we project strong fiscal performance for FY 2019, demonstrates our commitment to create shareholder value through sustainable and profitable net sales growth. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. On the beer topline front, your beer portfolio market share accelerated in Q4 within a weaker category. So, any highlights on what drove the market share momentum, and does that give you visibility, as you look at to fiscal 2019 that you can aid your volume goals, even if the industry softens further? And also, can you just tease out specifically the net impact you're expecting from innovation on beer volume in fiscal 2019 guidance and a review of how the Familiar expansion and Premier launch are trending in the market so far in March? Robert Sands : Yes, Dara. I'll comment on it all. I mean, first of all, yes, the fundamental answer to your question is yes. I think that our performance in the fourth quarter gives us a significant amount of confidence going into the first quarter and the fiscal year, regardless of what's happening in the beer category in general. In fact, I don't really think that the two are connected to the extent that we're looking at the beer category ex-Constellation's beer business. So, I don't think that there's that kind of interaction in that -- the beer category exclusive of Constellation really has much to do with how Constellation's beer brands are performing or will perform in the future. So, we feel pretty good about where we're going. And if the beer category softens further, it just probably means that we're going to have larger market share gains as we go into this year. And then new products, they are contributing to our growth this year. Our new products are performing, I would say, extremely well. I'm talking about the Premier and Familiar. And when I say performing well, reorder rates are very strong. And by all indications, it's looking like it's going to be an extreme -- they're going to be extremely good introductions and therefore, we're real optimistic. It's probably providing 200 to 300 basis points of our growth in fiscal 2019. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Robert Sands : Hi Caroline. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thank you and what a great year. As we move forward, you're adding a lot more capacity than you'd originally planned for very good reasons. Do you think that that's the way this is going to continue, that each year, where initially, we thought there might be a falloff in CapEx in the outer years. If you keep up, a sort of close to double-digit topline growth rate, will you continue to add capacity at a similar rate? Robert Sands : Well, we're planning out quite a number of years. So, I think the answer to your question is no. We're not going to continue to simply add capacity like this every year. But as we get out four, five years, if the growth continued to be, I'd say, outsized, we will have to add capacity at some point in the future. But I think that what we've -- what we're doing now pretty much covers us for a significant period of time. So, I don't think that you should be expecting more capacity projects in the near future. I think this takes us up to about 44 million hectoliters of capacity, okay, which should clearly get us to where we need to be through 2023. So, no. We're not going to be adding capacity at this rate in the near future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. Robert Sands : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : I was curious if you could talk a little bit more, actually, about fit for growth. So, you mentioned it in the context of ERP systems, but I guess, other investments that are necessary to, kind of, go after the cost savings and any kind of quantification you could give and timeline for what you're expecting to be able to get out of fit for growth, and if that's -- where are those dollars are expected to go? And then just one follow-up was Rob, you said 200 to 300 basis points of growth coming from Premium and Familiar. I'm just assuming that's a growth number, that's not net of assumed cannibalization? David Klein : So, I'll take the fit for growth and then also cover up on a -- on the cannibalization point. But -- so from a fit for growth standpoint, Lauren, we're doing this program because we think that there are ways for us to get more efficient as a company over -- by reengineering our business processes. We expect that the savings, which at this point, we're not ready to quantify publicly, the savings, we would expect that reinvest in growth initiatives like the initiatives that we talked about this year, like building a better digital connectivity with our consumers, with our customers, with our retailers; investing in creating and marketing brands and capabilities in the cannabis space; as well as looking at different ways to get our products to market from a DTC standpoint. These sorts of investments we want to make in our business and we feel that we can mine our current P&L to fund them. And that's really the point of the fit for growth program. We're really in the early stages of scoping out the ERP program and the process redesign work and so you'll hear more about that over the coming months. And then in terms of overall growth in the portfolio, I think the way to think about it, there are two ways to look at it, I suppose. One is we expect our base business net sales in beer to grow high single-digits. And so any difference between that base growth and the NPD, so Premier and Familiar is -- so the difference between the growth in our base business and our guidance is explained by Premier and Familiar. And so I would say that the 200 to 300 basis points is probably exclusive of cannibalization. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Thank you. Good morning. Robert Sands : Hey Viv. Vivien Azer : So, I wanted to double back on the beer category dynamics. Clearly, you guys are floating above the fray in terms of the competitive activity that mainstream price points. But we are hearing from the trade press, about heightened competitively at the high end as well, given some of the capacity issues that are happening in craft. So, a two-part question, please. Number one, I'd love your thoughts on what you're seeing in the craft category. And then number two, how does that inform you're thinking around price realization? Thank you. Robert Sands : So, Vivian, I'd say a couple of things. Number one, I think that unfortunately, we talk about these categories generically and I think that even within these categories, there are subcategories and there's things that are going on that have really no impact whatsoever on other elements of what you're referring to as a category like the high end. So, first of all, if you looked at various definitions of the craft category, what you'll see is, on a total category basis that pricing in craft is pretty much consistent with the whole high end or everything else for that matter. But within craft, what you have seen is antidotal reports of various craft beer companies reducing prices and introducing cheaper, larger pack sizes, basically to do anything to try to stem their declines. These are specific companies. But it's not really across the whole category affecting pricing in the craft category. That's really more a function of the fragmentation of craft and the competition in craft with the hugely expanding number of craft breweries and the trend towards hyper localization and fragmentation for that matter. But in general, craft pricing is pretty stable at about plus 1.5%. Probably, more importantly, the antidotal pricing you're talking about has no -- zero interaction with us. It does not affect us whatsoever. If a particular craft brand, because they're falling out of bed drops, they're price to $9.99 or introduces a 15-pack at some cheap price, it matters not to us whatsoever and really doesn't affect the parts of the business that we play in. So, most importantly, I guess, to get directly to the point, we don't see anything that's going on across the beer industry or any category for that matter that would cause us to do anything differently than our normal 1% to 2% price increase to cover typical inflation in the business. So, we feel good about that. We don't see anything that's occurring that we think would jeopardize that. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Robert Sands : Hi Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi. So, I was hoping you guys could drill down a little bit more on your Q4 beer margins, which ended up better than, I think, you guys had been expecting, based on some comments you made few months ago. So, just wanted to understand the key drivers of that. And then, David, you mentioned you expect beer margin expansion in FY 2019, but your guidance really doesn't call for much. So, you touch on that, please, and the factors you expect that could limit beer margin upside? And then I'd just love some thoughts on long-term expectations for beer margins, what's realistic? Thank you. David Klein : Yes. So, in terms of Q4, the things that were really a little different from may be where we expected it to land was performance in particular continued, really strong operating performance at Obregon from a cost perspective. We also sad some FX benefits that are -- that we got in the fourth quarter, that's may be more of a timing benefit than anything else, because some of the peso strengthening that we were seeing coming into the quarter that we were concerned about actually ended up getting captured in inventory at year-end. So, it's just a timing difference. In terms of the margin guidance, we are -- we expect that, depending on upon where you pick net sales number and where you pick your operating margin number in that 9% to 11% range you can see that there's some amount, although, as you say, limited amounts of margin expansion plant in our numbers. But that's inclusive of the investment that we're making in the launch of Premier and Familiar, which, as we said, would take our marketing spend as a percent of net sales up by between 50 and 100 basis points for the fiscal year. I would say that over time, Bonnie, I probably would say that we -- we'll continue to drive as much operating margin as we can out of the business. We like the trends we're seeing in the -- in gross margin. We think we can get a little sharper over time from an SG&A standpoint. But we'll continue to invest in our brands from a marketing standpoint. So, I would say that we think that there's some amount of margin expansion to be had over the next couple of years, but I would put it in a reasonably small bucket, as we are really going to try to continue to drive the topline of the business. And for me, that's the thing, I think, that's missed a little bit by our story is, the power of the topline growth of our beer business, where last year, we grew 10%. This year, we have a range to grow 9% to 11%. We're setting ourselves up to continue to grow at that rate for the foreseeable future. And so I guess, we would be -- we want to make sure we're appropriately investing in our brands as opposed to just dropping on dollars to the bottom-line. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats. Just wanted to follow-up on your guidance for the funding for growth, if you will, this new program. For the expenditures that you're hoping for this ERP, are they included in your guidance within the range of margins that you have on the ongoing -- on the growing margin guidance? And also, if you can comment a little bit on wine. If you, kind of, a normalize after you cycle this impact on the first quarter, what is the kind of growth that you're seeing on depletions? I mean I understand, obviously, the Focus Brands, but if you look at it like excluding these effect, we are looking at, obviously, a much bigger -- if you can do the math, a much better improvement after this effect in the first quarter. Thank you. David Klein : Yes. So, on the fit for growth in ERP question, that's included in our guidance. Again, that's part of why you see costs -- our corporate costs going up. In terms of wine growth, we -- Rob mentioned that we had seen a bit of a slowdown from where we were over, say, the last five to 10 years in the wine business. We saw a bit of a slowdown in calendar year 2017. We, however, are also seeing a bit of a bifurcation within the wine business, where -- and Bill talked about this at the CAGNY Conference, where above the -- that $11 price point, which is somewhat arbitrary, but above that $11 price point, we're seeing market growth that are in the range of 13% versus 1% growth rate for the brands below the $11 price point. And we believe that you see this capability in our portfolio when you see the growth that we have in our Focus Brands versus the growth in the rest of the market. And so we remain quite bullish on our Focus Brands, while we continue to work the SKU rationalization sorts of activities that we've talked about in the past, which, as Rob mentioned, is creating a drag on the business, so about 100 basis points in FY 2018 and we'll have included in our guidance, some amount of drag, maybe in the 50 basis points range during FY 2019. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, David. Just a follow-up on FX. What is embedded in your guidance, in terms of, you always hedged part of your COGS? Can you update us on the range of FX that you disclosed before? David Klein : Yes. I think, from an FX standpoint, at this point in the year, we're probably around 60% hedged. Our biggest exposure, as you know, is to the peso, and the peso has been fairly stable recently, although, we expect there could be some volatility in the peso, as we go through the public discussions around NAFTA and the elections in Mexico. Andrea Teixeira : And you're ready to disclose the amounts that you're hedged at or-- David Klein : Yes. I just -- again, I think, we're roughly in that 60% hedged range as we go into the year. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Great. Good morning guys. Robert Sands : Good morning. Stephen Powers : I guess just given how important increased distribution is to the beer-growth algorithm, can you talk about your line of sight to incremental points of distribution entering fiscal 2019 across all the brand families inclusive of Premier, Familiar but also, what you expect on Modelo, Pacifico, and craft? And I guess, as you think about that, I'm curious about two things. First, what portion of the gains embedded in the outlook you feel at this point is more or less locked in versus what you need to go out incrementally win over the course of the year? And then second, just for context, as your conversations with distributors and retailers have taken shape, if there's any way to frame how this year's setup compares to what you might have saw entering fiscal 2018? That'd be great context. Thanks. Robert Sands : So, our line of sight to getting more distribution is very good, in that we have definitive distribution gaps in big -- parts of our portfolio. And therefore, we have a lot of upside, especially when you look at the Modelo Especial family and when you look at brands like Pacifico, there continue to be huge upsize to be gained in distribution, and our organizations are all tasked and incentivized against getting that distribution. So, I'd say, we have very good line of sight into getting the distribution. And therefore, it's just another factor that goes into the confidence that we have in the business of continuing along the same lines that it has and in the guidance that we've given. So, there's really no magic to any of that. It's all about sales execution and where we are in terms of what the gaps are, and our people are acutely aware of where the gaps are, and they will be continuing to drive against closing those gaps. So, I'd say, a high line of sight. David Klein : And I would also say, Stephen, that we believe that we've said before 50% of our growth is sourced from distribution. We think that we can continue that for the next several years, meaning that we have, as Rob said, line of sight into distribution opportunities that allow us to continue on that growth trajectory for the next few years. Stephen Powers : Okay, that's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Robert Sands : Hi Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Good morning everyone. Just that -- I wanted a follow-up, I guess, on Caroline's question earlier around CapEx. And forgive me if might've missed this. But David, could you just kind of give us some sense of beyond 2019, how CapEx sort of phases with the capacity expansion, and maybe just remind us of, kind of, where you sit now in terms of what maintenance CapEx levels are? And then sort of what the growth CapEx is going to be over the next several years? David Klein : So, Bryan, the way I think about it, and when we get out a couple of years in capital, we're all kind of making the numbers up. But when I think about it, we know that we've committed to -- after FY 2019, capital expenditures in Mexico that are in the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range. And we know that that all needs to be completed by FY 2023. That's likely to be front-end loaded in that time period, because we're building out capacity. In addition to that, in the rest of our business, just broadly speaking, we spend about $200 million in CapEx, that's the corporate initiatives, wine and spirits. And then just as a placeholder, we've been thinking, its $100 million to $200 million of spend in our beer business from an -- on an ongoing business for maintenance as well as for value engineering and return-generating investments in our production assets outside of simple capacity expansion. So, I think that kind of frames up where we see CapEx beyond FY 2019. Bryan Spillane : So, that would mean, I guess, that like 2020 CapEx might look similar to fiscal 2019, and then it begins to kind of taper from there. Would that be a good way to, kind of, think about modeling it? David Klein : Yes, I think that's fair. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research. Timothy Ramey : Thanks so much. Congratulations. I was interested in your comment on the $19 million write-down of smoke damage to bulk wine. Are you seeing that more broadly in the industry? And does that firm up the bulk wine market? Does that wine, that's written down, still exist for the bulk wine market? Or is it essentially condemned? Robert Sands : So, we're -- I'd say, interestingly enough, we're probably the first company to talk about this. I believe that there's probably a significant amount of smoke tainted or damaged bulk wine or wine out there in the tanks and in the valley. I think that it's not something that everybody's necessarily telegraphing. I don't know how it's going to affect the bulk wine market other than I don't believe that is -- will have any effect on us, whatsoever. And we're certainly not going to use any of the tainted -- smoke-tainted bulk wine or buy any. And I think that from what I hear, a few others -- some of the most premium guys who are now realizing that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there, I've heard of a couple that are going to skip the vintage. But I don't -- this isn't going to have any impact on us or our ability to meet our guidance. Our wine business is very strong. We've got some fantastic brands that are just really blowing the facts off a lot of the industry. Things like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and Prisoner could get some unbelievable innovation out there, like DERANGE, which is our new high-end wine blend out of the Prisoner Wine Company, part of our business. We've really been leaders in driving the new, sort of, barrel-aged spirits or Bourbon Barrel-Aged wines with our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is in significant growth and Cooper & Thief, which is -- I think, it'll turn out to be a significant phenomenon where we've extended that to tequila, Barrel-Aged Sauvignon Blanc, which I'd say try it. It's very unusual wine. So, the smoke taint issue is a small one. We don't expect it to be a recurring matter. It's relatively immaterial to us. And we don't expect it to have any impact on us going forward. But yes, I think that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there in the valley. Timothy Ramey : Actually I was thinking of it from a positive perspective, given that, as you put it, skipping of vintage and making an insurance claim it's one of the best ways to enhance margins and perhaps pricing and [Indiscernible], would you -- do you think that's overstating it? Robert Sands : For some companies, I'd say that, that's possibly the case. We're not going to have to skip our vintage in any of our wines as a consequence of this. But it may be the case with some others, and it could work to their advantage or disadvantage. I'm not actually really sure, one way or the other. So-- Timothy Ramey : Thanks Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Amit Sharma : Hi good morning everyone. Robert Sands : Good morning. Amit Sharma : Rob, a quick clarification and then a bigger question on the Premier. The 50 basis point SKU rationalization impact on the wine business in this year, should we assume that's the end of it? And going forward that is no longer a headwind? And then I have a Premier question. Robert Sands : So, no. I'd say that in general, SKU rat is going to be the case. I think it's just generally good business practice to call the portfolio every year of smaller and slow-moving SKUs that are non-strategic to the company. It helps to make sure that, fundamentally, the whole supply chain isn't mucked up and that you're managing the balance sheet, in particular, working capital, efficiently by not -- by getting rid of, as I said, small and slow-moving SKUs that can tend to drive inventories up and basically gum up your operations. So, we'll have SKU rat every year, which is a big portfolio like our wine portfolio, would not be unusual at all and it's probably best practice in terms of managing the business and the balance sheet and working capital and efficiencies. Amit Sharma : Got it. And then on Premier, look our conversation with some of the distributors has been really positive. There is clearly a lot of enthusiasm for how the brand has performed initially. Just as you look maybe two, three years down the road, and you think about the targeted audience and segment, I mean, close to 150 million cases segment, what are the realistic scenario for Premier as a percent of share for that segment? Robert Sands : Well, I mean, that's a little bit hard to predict. But I said something a little earlier about not getting too focused on categories and it's really about brands. It's interesting to talk about like the super-premium category doing well, because it's not a category, it's one brand. It's Mich Ultra. And then Premier is a new brand or a new sub-brand of Corona, that is designed to appeal to that consumer and has some additional attributes of being more premium than what's out there and successful at the moment. So, we expected -- the introduction's been extremely strong. You've talked to distributors. Distributors are very enthusiastic, retailers are enthusiastic, the consumer seems to like the product. So, we think it's going to be a very highly successful SKU in the Corona brand family. So, we're very optimistic, but I don't think that we can sit here necessarily and predict exactly what share it's going to take of what. As I said, there's no category anyway. It's a brand. Amit Sharma : Got it. Robert Sands : So, we think it's going to compete extremely well against the competition, let's put it that way. Amit Sharma : I understand. Thank you so much. Robert Sands : And it may be by the way that the competition -- hopefully, the competition does well and Premier does well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Freda Zhuo : Hi, this is actually Freda on for Judy. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on CapEx a little bit and get a sense of what drove the decision-making between expanding incrementally at Obregon versus, maybe, a little bit more Mexicali or building even further with the Nava. And then if you look at like the $900 million guide for Obregon, like 5 million hectoliter expansion, it would imply that the cost per hectoliter is maybe a little bit higher versus what we've seen in some of the other CapEx rounds that you've done. So, if you could provide details to what the drivers to the difference may be for this expansion that would be great. Thanks. Robert Sands : I'll let David answer part of the question. But I'd say a couple of things. First of all, with the kind of growth that we are having and that we're now predicting in the short-term, it's basically resulted in our deciding that it's prudent, given the lead-time -- the lead times to put more -- to start putting in place more capacity, okay? Why Obregon? We think that geographic diversification in Mexico is also a good idea. These states Baja California, Sonora, Coahuila all have different politics, and we think it's only prudent to make sure that we have capacity in a number of different places in Mexico rather than overly concentrating our capacity in one particular place, even though we don't see any problem or major problem, let me put it that way, in any one of our geographic locations. And then you also have to remember when we're -- when you're talking capacity, capacity is not -- we tend to talk about it in gross terms, right? 44 million hectoliters, which is, I don't know, about 500 million cases. And when I say that you've got to be careful, it's not just sort of the gross -- what we have to have is the capacity to meet our demand in our peak production months. That's how capacity is planned, because it's not even throughout the years. There's certain months leading up into the summer where we have our largest production runs. And therefore, our capacity is determined off of those peak months. So, it's just a process of us continuously reviewing where we are against our long, long-term plans, how we're doing in the near future, we -- and what we expect in the near future and what the lead times are in putting in place capacity. And so we make these decisions to stay ahead of the game, because -- and it's actually a fairly easy decision. I think I've said this probably in the past -- and that -- probably the worst thing that we could do is run out of capacity. So, if you start from that premise, given the growth in the business and the fact that the immediate-term prospects remain consistent with that, it makes sense to be putting in place this capacity, given the lead times, so that we don't run out of capacity sometime in the future, which, as I said, a whole bunch of perspectives, financially, customer service, that would be the worst thing that we could possibly do. So, it's really not a very hard decision. David Klein : Yes. And then just on the build-out costs. Just to be clear about what we're doing at Obregon is, we're building a brewery that's literally across the road from our brewery. So, it's effectively a Greenfield inclusive of infrastructure, land acquisition costs and so forth. So, from that perspective, it's in line with what we've paid elsewhere. Freda Zhuo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and terrific quarter and year. This, Corona, 6% growth for the family, wondering if you could unpack that a little bit in terms of how much is Corona Extra, how are cans doing, draft? Any sense, so that we can get a better sense of how that number builds up. And then looking out on the next 12 months, can you give us your expectations or rank between Pacifico, Premier and Familiar, which -- how those will rank in terms of adding incremental volume to the company? Thank you. David Klein : So, in terms of growth within the family, I think about half of the growth rate came from the base Corona Extra, and that includes all packaged formats, Robert. But then the other half of the growth came from the rest of the family but primarily driven by Familiar, the success of Familiar during the year. Robert Ottenstein : And how was that -- how much growth did cans give? David Klein : I don't have that. We can get that to you, Robert. I don't have that at the -- of the off the top of my head. Robert Ottenstein : Terrific. And I'm hearing great things about Familiar. How would you rank, again, Familiar, Premier, and Pacifico in terms of likely incremental contribution over the next 12 months? Robert Sands : Well, it's a little hard to do, because it's all a little bit different in that -- Premier's sort of a full-blown national rollout. Familiar's more concentrated against the larger Hispanic markets. And Pacifico is really only in the West and has its core business in the -- in Southern California, but is expanding rapidly. So, I think it's good to be some and some. I may not -- I guess, I can't tie up at the top of my head exactly what the ranking is going to be other than we expect them all to make a significant contribution to that, roughly, 200 to 300 basis points that we were talking about in NPD. So, for the moment and you can talk to Patty or whomever more about this, after we looked at it a little bit more closely, I'd say that they're all making a roughly equivalent contribution to the 200 to 300 basis points. Robert Ottenstein : Okay. And just to be clear, you're including Pacifico in that number as well? Robert Sands : Yes, I'm -- Pacifico -- you know what? Yes, yes. Absolutely, we're -- Pacifico's not a new product introduction. Obviously, we're just dragging that brand. But interestingly enough, right? Victoria is also growing at high double-digits now, right? It isn't one of our focused brands. Meaning, we're not really putting the same effort right now behind Victoria that we are behind Pacifico, because that's really the -- one of the smaller brands that we think is first in line to really start driving to be the next major growth brand. But interestingly enough, Victoria's looking particularly strong as well. But Victoria is a little bit more like Familiar, in that it's got its main strength in the really concentrated Hispanic communities with large populations of unacculturated Hispanics, because Victoria is a very large brand in Mexico and very well known in Mexico, but is not very well known in the United States and therefore, to the general market and the more acculturated or longer term Hispanic population. So, that's got a lot of promise too, is all I would tell you. Robert Ottenstein : Great. And on Pacifico, I've noticed, at least in California, that it seems to be priced somewhat less than Corona and Modelo. Is that correct? And do you plan to have, if that is correct, somewhat lower pricing on Pacifico, nationally? Or do you look to line price it? Robert Sands : So, the answer is no. I mean, I don't know exactly what you're seeing. I think in general terms, it's pretty much priced with everything else. So -- and there would be no -- we would not be interested in a strategy to price it below Corona or Modelo Especial. So-- Robert Ottenstein : Good to hear. Robert Sands : That's a resounding no. Robert Ottenstein : Okay. It must've been a retailer's decision and-- Robert Sands : Yes, that can always happen. We always see antidotes -- retailers control their own pricing. So, if they want to really blow something out, they'll do it. But there's -- I think if you even look at pricing in IRI across the Pacifico versus the other families, you're not going to see anything different. And there's -- as I said, resoundingly no on the streets that there's no strategy to do that. Robert Ottenstein : Right answer. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Will Chappell of SunTrust. Robert Sands : Hi Bill. William Chappell : Good morning. It's Bill. Two quick questions. One, just any thoughts update on aluminum and tariffs? I understand that you're probably largely hedged and it's still a small part of your, kind of, input cost. But any kind of initial thoughts of how it could affect you or the industry? And then second, just on a modeling standpoint. On depreciation, I think you said it's up 30% in 2019. Is that straight lined across the year? Or are there any things that come on where it, kind of, build as we go through the year? David Klein : Yes. So, on the depreciation point, yes, it will build a bit as we put assets into service, but the total will be -- it's that 30%. Not dissimilar to year's number. It'll be that $50 some million additional depreciation for the full year, but it'll build over time. And from an -- from a tariff perspective, as you mentioned, we have a strong hedging program, and so we're protected from a price standpoint. But even from a specific imposition of the tariff on aluminum, it's going to have a deminimus effect on Constellation. And you've asked about the industry, I can't really comment on that. But it's not really going to have an effect on us as a result of our hedging program and our source of supply. William Chappell : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial. Mark Swartzberg : Great. Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. I like that phrase Robs, SKU rat, I haven't heard it, abbreviated that way, and that's my question-- Robert Sands : We really usually like to talk about rats on a conference call. Mark Swartzberg : That's fair enough. But you took down your outlook for your wine and spirits business at CAGNY and SKU rat seems to be -- the rat seem to be the factor here. Two questions really. Is that the only factor? And then secondly, if you say that you've set the targets back in November of 2016 and then you've decided to be more aggressive with SKU rationalization, what changed? Are you seeing just higher rates of decline in those SKUs that you want to -- reduced? So that -- those two questions. David Klein : Yes, I'll let Rob kind of finish up with the answer. But I'll just start-up, Mark, by saying, we're seeing -- we saw in calendar year 2017, a bit of a slowdown in the overall wine market. We still believe that the wine market is the 4% to 5% grower over time. We just saw a bit of a pullback. But we also are seeing this bifurcation in the market where it looks a little bit like beer, where you're seeing the higher end of the market and we -- for CAGNY, arbitrarily drew a line at $11 a bottle of retail. We're seeing that part of the market growing at 13% and below that, growing at 1%. And so yes, we're probably being a little more aggressive than we have been in the past to call our portfolio below $11, so that we have capacity to produce the brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford, and the Prisoner and other brands in our focus portfolio that are growing high margin brands. And so we're making a bit of an ROIC trade-off, that's causing us to have a bit of a drag on the net sales line. Robert Sands : Yes, I don't have anything really to add other than the bifurcation that David is talking about, is becoming more pronounced in that the growth is moving up the chain from a premiumization point of view, meaning the fastest growing categories are higher priced now than they even were a couple of years ago. And the lower end of the market is less healthy, even more so than it was a few years ago. Overall, we think the market -- in actuality, that's -- that the positive trend and it's a positive trend for us in particular because I'd say, we predicted this happening. And we've been generally organizing our portfolio and tweaking our portfolio to keep it moving up the price spectrum from an average price point perspective. So, I think we're particularly well-positioned at the current time to take advantage of the fact that these higher priced categories are now where the real outsized growth is. And I think a good example of that is a brand like Meiomi, which is a $20 bottle of wine and a very large brand. Much larger than -- five years ago, there was no brand at $20 a bottle that sold anywhere near -- or had the growth of what Meiomi has. So, these are very positive trends for us going forward. And it's not -- I don't think that's what one really should be looking at necessarily, is our overall growth rate, because of precisely this fact, there will be continued SKU rat at the lower end. And we will be -- and we will continue to focus more and more on the higher price points. And therefore, as sort of looking at our focus brand portfolio, which constitutes the -- of the large bulk of our sales and profits is really where you should look, because -- and there the growth is extremely healthy. I mean, that could be a business all in it of itself, right? A multi-billion dollar business, with growth in high single-digits in consumer products, which -- that would make it probably in the top 10 percentile of all consumer products' companies in terms of growth in CPG. So, that's what I would look at if I were you guys. Mark Swartzberg : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : And that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Robert Sands : Well, thank you all very much for the call today, and your great questions. I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of our many achievements in fiscal 2018. And our fiscal 2019 guidance reflects the confidence that we have in our business just to sustain our top-tier CPG growth profile. And we look forward to speaking with you in late June, when we report our first quarter results. And until then, of course, we'll be celebrating Cinco de Mayo by ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange and as always, we hope you choose our fine products to enjoy responsibly as part of your spring celebrations. So, thanks again, everyone and have a great day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter sales and earnings results. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect significant investment across the business designed to ensure that we maintain our growth momentum well into the future as well as other timing issues. We have maintained our earnings guidance as the top line is responding to these investments, including digital enablement for our e-commerce initiatives and our new ERP platform as part of our Fit for Growth initiative. We continue to work with Canopy Growth to develop and build cannabis brands. Our investment in Canopy is certainly paying off as we have recognized gains of more than $700 million in our reported results since we made this investment last year. Now most importantly, we continue to invest in brand building through our innovation and new product development initiatives across the country. Our most significant investment includes an increase in beer marketing to support our newly introduced products, which are exceeding our expectations and fueling sales momentum. The successful launches of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar are the first two major Corona initiatives in more than 25 years. Premier has achieved record speed, record speed to shelf with velocities increasing each month since launch and Familiar has already achieved a healthy share of the category in its regional expansion with velocities outpacing our expectations. These innovations help drive industry\u2019s leading depletion growth of 9% for our beer business during the first quarter despite unfavorable weather related impacts early in the quarter in some of our largest markets. As a matter of fact, this quarter marks 32 consecutive quarters of growth as the winning streak continues for the Constellation beer business. We remain the leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market contributing more growth than any other supplier during the first quarter. Constellation also won the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays driven by strong execution and sales increases across the Modelo Especial, Corona Premier and Corona Familiar brands. All of which were top 5 share gainers in IRI channels during the quarter. We are well positioned throughout the remainder of fiscal 2019 with a great lineup of marketing and promotional activities to support the ongoing growth momentum of our portfolio. I would like to take a minute to highlight some of the activities we have underway for the summer selling season, the Corona Extra Summer campaign is currently in full stride leveraging new strategic partnerships and increased media activities. Corona Premier launched new English and Spanish language TV campaigns during the first quarter, which will continue throughout the summer and into the fall to drive broad brand awareness. New Premier programming has been developed that is relevant for live sports including golf, Major League Baseball and the NHL. Earlier this year, Modelo became the official beer for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is one of the fastest growing sports in America. Throughout the year, Modelo will celebrate UFC\u2019s 25 years of fighting spirit through fight sponsorships and national retail activation. And this summer Casa Modelo will celebrate soccer as the beautiful game through a national retail promotion as well as Spanish language broadcast of the World Cup. During the first quarter, we executed a nationwide launch of the Pacifico 12-pack can to build on the success of 24-ounce SKU. In support of Pacifico\u2019s national expansion, the brand aired its first ever national TV ad campaign and is poised to be a top 10 national TV beer advertiser this summer. In addition to the Corona Premier and Familiar rollouts, we recently launched new brand entrants into test market within the alternative beverage alcohol space, which is a growing market opportunity that has been incremental to the beer category. The new Specta-spiked premium seltzer is targeted as the female consumer who is looking for better-for-you, light options that fit an active lifestyle. Three new flavors made from natural ingredients have been introduced in select Northeast test markets. We have recently introduced Corona Refresca in three test markets. This premium spiked refresher in two tropical flavors is being supported by English and Spanish language TV as well as sampling events in targeted digital and social media activities. Western Standard, a high-end barrel finished easy drinking lager will be available in test markets beginning in August. We are leveraging the equity and authenticity of our high-end small batch high west whiskey brand and building off trends of craft sprits and barrel-aged beverages. From an operational perspective during the quarter, we began the new expansion of our Obregon brewery while continuing to make progress at our Mexicali and Nava sites. The final phase of the 30 million hectoliter expansion project at Nava is on track as we add capacity for production, fermentation and for filtration. And furnace #4 at our Nava glass plant is now fully optimized and running at capacity. Construction continues at Mexicali with brew house tank fabrication nearly completed. We are also progressing well on the packaging hall and site utility installation. Overall, I am very excited about the ongoing growth prospects for our beer business. We remain committed to delivering our fiscal 2019 targets for this business, with net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range. Moving to wine and spirits, our wine and spirits business delivered first quarter results that were consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. As previously discussed, we experienced the Meiomi supply shortage, which caused the timing overlap versus last year\u2019s first quarter. In addition, this year\u2019s first quarter depletion trends were muted following a better than expected finish to 2018. However, we continued to see strong consumer takeaway trends for our wine brands in the U.S. marketplace during the quarter as we gained share in IRI channels and we continued to make progress in executing a steady evolution to the high-end of the U.S. wine and spirits category by capturing growth at higher price points to achieve mix and margin benefits, particularly at the greater than $11 price point at retail. A good example of our success in this area includes key focus brands at these price points that posted double-digit depletion growth during the quarter, including Franciscan, High West, Robert Mondavi and the Prisoner portfolio. Currently, Constellation\u2019s wine business at the greater than $11 retail price point, is growing 12% versus market growth of 10%. Overall, our Focus Brands continue to drive growth of our wine and spirit portfolio and have consistently delivered growth at the 3x to 4x the U.S. market rate. From an innovation perspective, we are well-positioned with a strong pipeline of new brands including Black Box spirits, Robert Mondavi Selection Rum Barrel-Aged Merlot and Spoken Barrel, a Washington state red blend. In addition, we have expanded our rose offerings to include Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Black Box, Band of Roses, a Cheryl Smith brand to capitalize on this hot growing category within the U.S. wine industry. We will continue to support this innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. During the course [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize that there will be a slight delay in today\u2019s conference call, please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Rob Sands : \u2026..indicate that our total beverage alcohol strategy is working as we achieved the most retail sales growth by a wide margin among our U.S. beverage alcohol peers. As such, we remain one of the best growth stories within the U.S. CPG space. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the quarter. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Operator, this is Patty Yahn-Urlaub, are we back online? Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Okay, thank you. David Klein : Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. Q1 results were in line with our expectations and were on track to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $9.40 to $9.70. Now, let\u2019s review Q1 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 9% favorable pricing and a $10 million federal excise tax reduction related to tax reform. This benefit will not recur in the remaining months of calendar 2018 as we reached the maximum barrel-aged level allowed for this excise tax reduction. Depletion growth came in strong at 9%, with excellent portfolio performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. This growth is even more impressive considering the 12% depletion growth we are overlapping from Q1 last year and weather-related softness experienced throughout the industry in March and April. Beer operating margin decreased 230 basis points to 37.8% as the benefit of favorable pricing was more than offset by marketing investments, higher COGS and unfavorable foreign currency. The higher COGS reflect increases in transportation costs and depreciation. Beer segment depreciation increased $10 million to $49 million for Q1. Marketing as a percent of revenue increased 110 basis points to 11% of net sales driven by the upfront marketing investment supporting the successful Corona Premier and Familiar introductions. For fiscal \u201819, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 9% to 11%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a reminder, are facing a 12% shipment growth comparison for Q2 and 6% shipment growth comparison for Q3. We continue to expect operating margin improvement for fiscal \u201819 although benefits from product pricing, glass sourcing and operational efficiencies are expected to be mostly offset by marketing investments, increased transportation costs and higher depreciation. We continue to target fiscal \u201819 marketing as a percent of revenue in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% versus 9% for fiscal \u201818. This increase primarily reflects investment supporting our innovation activities and is weighted towards the first half of the year in an effort to generate strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As a result, Q2 marketing as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal \u201818 which came in at 8.4%. This marketing investment in the overlap of the strong Q2 fiscal \u201818 shipment volume is expected to move our Q2 fiscal \u201819 operating margin into the 39.5% to 40% range versus our record 41.2% operating margin result achieved in Q2 last year. Q1 fiscal \u201819 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT decreased 3% and 15% respectively. This was in line with our expectations as we overlap strong Q1 fiscal \u201818 wine and spirits financial results where EBIT grew approximately 20% and U.S. shipment volumes significantly outpaced depletions. Net sales were impacted by the overlap of strong shipment volume in Q1 fiscal \u201818 driven by replenishment of Meiomi supply, which was constrained coming out of Q4 fiscal \u201817. U.S. depletions were down 4% as overall depletion performance was muted following strong Q4 fiscal \u201818 results. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 430 basis points to 25% primarily driven by higher COGS mostly reflecting increased grape and transportation costs and marketing investments for key Focus Brands in innovation initiatives. We recognized approximately $5 million of income from our Opus One investment during Q1 due to a first time spring release of certain older vintages. The 2015 Opus One vintage to be released this fall is expected to be smaller than the previous year. As a result, fiscal \u201819 investment earnings from Opus are expected to be similar to our fiscal \u201818 earnings, but Q3 fiscal \u201819 investment earnings will be below Q3 last year. In Q2, we expect to see ongoing cost pressures and marketing investments impact wine EBIT performance. However, we expect financial performance to improve in the back half of the year, which includes the key holiday selling season. As a result, we continue to expect wine and spirits net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4% for fiscal \u201819. For wine and spirit sales, we continue to target low single-digit volume growth and mix benefits from our premiumization efforts. We continue to realize benefits from the increased marketing spend on brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford over the next several quarters. As Rob mentioned, the wine business gained IRI market share in the first quarter and has a strong innovation pipeline and solid programming in place for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect mix benefits and COGS productivity enhancements which are targeted for the back half of the year to be mostly offset by higher grape and transportation costs and marketing investments. Even with some of the cost pressures I just noted, we expect full year operating margin expansion for both business segments. However, we expect the deltas between sales and operating income growth to be contained within the guidance range provided. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects investments in people and consulting services in support of our growth organization, cannabis investments and our digital enablement in Fit for Growth initiatives. These investments will continue in Q2 when corporate expenses as a percent of sales, is expected to be similar to that of Q1. Interest expense for the quarter increased 7% primarily due to higher average borrowings. Fiscal \u201819 interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $10 billion, a decrease of $199 million since the end of fiscal 2018. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5x at the end of May versus 3.6x at the end of fiscal \u201818 while we continue to invest in our Mexican operations and return cash to shareholders with $141 million of dividends paid and $100 million of share repurchases for the quarter. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 21.4% versus 19.2% for last year. Our rate benefited from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, but was more than offset by higher tax on foreign earnings and lower benefits from stock-based compensation activity due primarily to timing. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal \u201819 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate in the 22% range. However, we continue to forecast our full year fiscal \u201819 effective tax rate to approximate 19% with stock-based compensation benefits expected to be weighted toward the back half of the year. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $336 million of free cash flow compared to $165 million for Q1 last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower CapEx and strong operating cash flow growth. While CapEx was down for the quarter, we still have significant spending planned for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion remains unchanged. This guidance includes approximately $900 million targeted for our Mexico beer operations expansion. We expect fiscal \u201819 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined. In Q1, we recognized an additional $258 million pre-tax unrealized gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy growth investment and warrants bringing the total pre-tax gain on this investment to over $700 million. Earlier this month, we acquired CAD$200 million worth of convertible debt securities issued by Canopy in support of their growth initiatives. We also recognized a $101 million net gain on the sale of our accolade wine investment. The gains I just noted were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. As mentioned earlier, we continue to project our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.70. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. Before closing, I\u2019d like to note we adopted new accounting standard guidance for revenue recognition at the beginning of the year. Under this guidance, we are recognizing certain sales incentives earlier than we have historically. We have provided restated income statement information for fiscal \u201817, fiscal \u201818 and fiscal 18 quarters in the investor overview section of our website. As a result of this activity, our fiscal \u201818 comparable basis diluted EPS was restated from $8.72 to $8.70 per share. In closing, we are executing against our plans and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal \u201819. While our first half financial results are being impacted by the investments behind the marketing, innovation and growth initiatives I noted earlier, we are confident that we will produce top-tier financial performance versus CPG for fiscal \u201819. We also believe the investments we are making in support of growth opportunities today position us to generate industry leading sustainable and profitable growth in FY \u201820 and beyond, while we deliver on our FY \u201819 commitments. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Rob Sands : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : I was hoping you could help us understand your conviction levels for the rest of the year given the weak Q1 results and your ability to hit your guidance ranges for the full year specifically for beer. When you look at the midpoint of your guidance, it implies that beer margins for the balance of the year need to expand 80 bps. So, could you drill down just a little bit more on the key drivers of that? And I guess I am just concerned that this might be tough given the spending and strong commodity and transportation cost inflation you touched on? And then does your guidance assume a price increase, for instance? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes, Bonnie, I will start off and I will let David address some of your points, but our convention level is very high. I think that as I said in my comments, the first quarter was very much in line with our own internal expectations. We had planned to invest behind in particular the new products and the beer portfolio as well as some other investments in a big way during the first half of this year and in particular the first quarter and we did make those investments and we see the top line coming through. And that\u2019s what I would say is the most important thing that everybody should be looking at is, is the top line coming through? And in that regard, the top line is probably a little bit above our own internal expectations and our new products are performing I would say, a little bit above our own internal expectations. So, our confidence level on the year and the guidance I would say is very strong. David? David Klein : Yes. So, Bonnie, let me start out with GP margins in beer. So, GP margins in beer benefited from robust pricing and then that was offset by incremental depreciation which we had planned on as well as about 70 basis points drag from incremental freight and logistics costs as a result of a tighter trucking market in the U.S. It also was impacted by a headwind on FX meaning the peso. Now that may seem a little counterintuitive, but the weakening of the peso really happened at the very end of May and our production cycle is such that transactional FX benefits or headwinds actually don\u2019t flow through for about 30 days. So, we didn\u2019t get any benefits from the weakening peso at the GP line in Q1. We expect the remainder of the year to have a \u2013 to experience a tailwind from FX. We also have had several COGS improvement initiatives underway that we believe will offset the transportation headwinds that we are facing. We fully expect to expand GP margins in FY \u201819 versus FY \u201818. Now, I will also go on and talk about overall operating margins. So, in Q1, we had about 110 basis point headwind versus last year from the marketing investments that we made behind our brands in particular, Premier and Familiar. We expect in Q2 that we will spend about 10% to 11% of net sales on marketing, primarily because the brands are getting real good traction in the marketplace. As Rob outlined, the distribution performance has been astounding and we now want to make sure that we continue to drive increasing velocity on the shelf. However, we are still committed to being in that 9.5% to 10% marketing load for the full year. So, when you kind of do all of that math you get to the place where confidence in the top line understanding that we have a path to expanding GP margins and getting the timing right on our marketing investments that we are very confident that we will deliver both our top line and bottom line guidance in the beer business. Bonnie Herzog : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. So, first just a couple of follow-ups. The drag from freight that you mentioned in the quarter, is that fairly consistent in the guidance in the balance of the year in terms of the year-over-year drag you are expecting in the balance of the year? And then on the beer pricing front, are you guys looking to perhaps be more aggressive with pricing given the rise you are seeing in transportation costs or do you look at it really more from a competitive standpoint in consumer demand elasticity than being tied to cost spikes? And then just the last one on the innovation front, can you just talk about Premier repeat rates at the consumer level so far. Obviously, you mentioned the distribution was strong, but what are you seeing in terms of repeat rates and cannibalization across the rest of your portfolio? Thanks. David Klein : So, I will start out and I will leave Rob to talk about the cannibalization, so yes, we, in our thinking about the rest of the year, we have fully internalized the effects of the transportation drag and expect to be able to cover it. From a pricing standpoint, we typically talk about being able to take price of 1% to 2% a year across the portfolio. We are seeing a fairly robust pricing environment in the high-end. I wouldn\u2019t expect that we will go outside of our pricing range that 1% to 2% range, although that work is going on literally this month as our teams are working through pricing. Rob Sands : And then I\u2019d say consumer takeaway and repeat on Premier in particular which is what we asked about. As I said, Premier is responding probably a bit above our expectations. We were very \u2013 we were able to gain distribution on the product at a pretty rapid rate, you see velocities at rates which we think are very strong. So I\u2019d say all good for Premier. We don\u2019t see any cheeks in that armor. We think it\u2019s going to be a very, very successful brand launch, plus we put a lot of investment behind the marketing of the brand. And I think that we are seeing the response to that. And then to your question on cannibalization, we are not seeing cannibalization at a rate greater than what we expected in the first place. So, pretty much, I mean that\u2019s the bottom line. So I would say as it relates to the new products, I put that above expectation, I\u2019d say as it relates to the entire Mexican portfolio, I\u2019d have to say that, that\u2019s also slightly above expectations as well. That business, our Mexican beer business is performing very strongly as we go through this fiscal year. So, we see no issues whatsoever there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. Just a couple of quick ones. Could you just discuss the level of beer inventories with distributors at the end of the quarter? How that looked versus where you are comfortable, is it a little high or little low and are there any other stock issues? Were there any other stock issues as a result of the new products being managed? The second thing really is just I have never in the past decade, I don\u2019t think I heard you call out grape costs, so it sounds like those are creeping up if you could explain why? Thanks. Rob Sands : Yes. So in terms of inventory levels at distributors, they are in line with where we typically are at this point of the year perhaps a bit on the low side. So I don\u2019t think there are any distributor load issues clearly and there weren\u2019t significant out of stocks to the best of my knowledge. From a grape cost standpoint, the callout is really based upon the flow-through of a tight NAPA harvest year 2016, which is starting to come through our P&L. Also, there was issues in Italy as well in terms of the grapes that are coming through that are driving increased cost. Now that said, the operations team in the wine business has some overhead initiatives and some blend management initiatives that we have put in place that will start to see flow through the P&L over the remainder of the year. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s worrisome there. It\u2019s just a callout in terms of our margins in line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning everyone. So, I want to just perhaps go back to the kind of depletion trends and how you see it evolving for the rest of the summer and on the price \u2013 and the pricing commentary that you gave, in terms of timing \u2013 is it the timing around October, which is the typical historical trend for the industry or given the cost pressures you may anticipate this price increase will perhaps reduce the promotional levels as we go? And then related to that just so as a clarification, so you are saying the second quarter pressure is on gross margin for the beer business would be slightly less than what we saw and then compounded the cadence through the rest of the fiscal year given that FX has been more favorable now that the beers are depreciating or should we still see some sort of the same magnitude pressure on the second quarter? Thank you. David Klein : So let me start with the last one first. So in terms of gross margin in Q2, we expect that some of \u2013 we will still have some transportation headwinds we actually expect instead of having an FX headwind will have a bit of an FX tailwind and we will get some of the operational benefits that I touched on earlier. So, any operating margin pressure in Q2 will really come from the incremental spend behind our brands that I talked about from a marketing standpoint being in that 10% to 11% range of net sales. We are working through our price increase process. Our revenue councils have been meeting working with our sales people to try to arrive at our pricing increase, which will take place in October, it will be announced before then. So, we see no changes on that front. And depletions I would say that 9% were quite strong, especially given the weather effects that we are seeing across the country, but in particular for us, in California, which is in our largest market. So, we are very happy with those depletion trends and we are feeling pretty bullish on the performance of that business throughout the remainder of the year. Andrea Teixeira : Thanks, David. And on depletion, can you give us like how much was each quarter so that we can see the cadence? David Klein : No, we don\u2019t really give depletion guidance. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. And I am saying within the month of the fiscal \u2013 the first quarter fiscal \u201819? David Klein : Yes, we don\u2019t break it out to that level, but again, just generally and you can assume that March was soft in California, April was soft elsewhere in the country and May looked pretty strong, so. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen. Vivien Azer : Hi, thank you. So, I wanted to touch on Premier and Familiar as well please. So, two questions. In terms of the distribution gains, can you contextualize how your kind of ACV like has changed and perhaps like kind of the size of your shelf set has changed with this incremental innovation, one and number two, any callouts in terms of competitive responses? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes, Vivien. ACV is a great story. We built ACV in Premier thus far to 63% and Familiar without it being introduced everywhere to 37%. So, we are pretty excited about that. And as I sort of indicated, I placed that in the category of excellent results and even potentially above our own expectations. And then I would say in terms of the shelf, we are fundamentally getting incremental shelf space for these products, which is great and makes a lot of sense for the retailers. I mean I would say that retail is getting it, okay, retail understands and they are getting that they can increase their own sales and profitability by getting behind this portfolio, Constellation\u2019s portfolio. So, we continue to be by a factor of many folds, the largest provider of growth at retail of any beverage alcohol company period in the United States. So, we are pretty pleased with these results which is one of the reasons I would say why we have the stomach, okay, to invest behind the portfolio, the way that we have invested behind the portfolio. So, we are pretty confident as we sit here right now that this is going to work out well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong : Hi. So, one is just a quick follow-up on gross margins on beer, David, just was there any impact on Q1 related to any of the trades been linked to the Premier and the Familiar expansion? And then secondly the broader question just really on the Corona brand family, so obviously the new innovations are lifting the gross rate of the entire family, which is positive, but you are seeing slowdown in terms of the Corona Extra and the Corona Light declining? And I know Rob you talked about cannibalization actually being pretty close to your expectations, so what do you think is happening to those particular brands? And is there any concern that even though the family is accelerating that particularly those brands are a little bit soft as you think about the growth rate into maybe next year as you lap the innovation driven growth this year? Rob Sands : Yes. I guess, I will comment on the last point. As I said, cannibalization is well within what we expected and predicted. We don\u2019t see cannibalization really being a huge factor except perhaps against Corona Light, which I would say is what we expected. Any impacts on Corona \u2013 Corona Extra, which is performing very well is probably mostly weather-related in March in the first month. And frankly, I don\u2019t really like to bring the weather off, because it doesn\u2019t really matter and I think that we fully expect the portfolio and the base portfolio to respond or to perform as we expected. If you take a look at the whole Corona family, for instance, we were tracking, I don\u2019t know, 200 or 300 basis points or 200 basis points behind where we were for the first quarter. So, that only appears to us that one plus one meaning the base portfolio plus the new products is adding up to 3, not just 2 or even below 2. So I think we are at 14.7% IRI, so \u2013 and higher than that for the latest. So, on consumer takeaway is very, very strong across the entire portfolio. As I said, Corona Light, we expected some cannibalization there. David Klein : And Judy, there was no real meaningful effect on the drag on margins as a result of the new product launches. Those were quite smooth based upon some really good work out of our production folks. Judy Hong : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Rob, I was wondering if you could perhaps reflect on how you are looking at the cannabis opportunity touching on what roughly kind of your investment level and e-cannabis related projects this year. Do you see that being more or less than what you thought it would be 6 months ago? And in addition, can you address the potential of doing something in California, Loginetis is coming out of a product in 1 to 2 months, is there anyway in which you can create a separate subsidiary or something that would give you regulatory comfort that you could enter that market at some point in the future even if we don\u2019t get full federal legalization. Is it even a remote possibility? Thank you. Rob Sands : So, first of all, Robert, our investment in cannabis is completely in line with what we expected, but that said, we are making a significant investment in Canada from an operating point of view. We all know of our investment in Canopy and of course that\u2019s working out quite well, but we didn\u2019t do it specifically to speculate on Canopy stock, because that\u2019s not what we do. We did it to, in essence, have a stake in Canopy and to create what\u2019s almost a joint venture between ourselves and Canopy to develop product for the world market, okay, including the U.S. So, we have a team and a significant team of people that both came out of Constellation as well as new hires sort of the full accouterment that\u2019s necessary to really develop products. They are headquarters, we call them, Green Star, they are headquartered in Toronto and they are working diligently with many of the major both advertising firms and marketing firms and consulting firms for that matter. We also have Bane engaged on that topic meaning cannabis, so that we are ensuring that we are covering all fronts on that. I think that as to your question about the United States, the answer is, is that we are not going to do anything that is violative of federal law, but that said, we are looking closely at precisely that issue and making sure that we understand what we can do and what we can\u2019t do. And sort of as you implied there maybe things that we can do and we will do them if we can do them as I said it\u2019s not violative of federal laws and we would like to. So, yes, we are aware of the Loginetis. What they are saying, let me put it that way, I don\u2019t have any really true inside knowledge of exactly what they are doing and how they are doing it, but we are pretty interested in what they are doing and how they are doing it and we don\u2019t intend to get caught and becoming from behind. So I suppose therefore the answer to your question is yes, we are looking at it pretty carefully and if we see that opportunity within the confines of what we can legally do, we will do it. Robert Ottenstein : Terrific. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. Hey, good morning. I think Rob probably continued talking in the couple of minutes that you weren\u2019t on the call and if it was true to form previous calls it might have been when you are discussing some of the brand performance in beer, Modelo Especial, we didn\u2019t hear any commentary on that if there was some? So that would be one question to maybe repeat some of that. And second of the wine grapes, based on my data, it looks like 2017 would have been flat to down from \u201816 so you understanding your FIFO structure, should we expect some easing of that as we roll forward? Rob Sands : I will let David address that. Yes, I think we have some technical difficulties in the call. And I believe I was talking about wine and spirits and perhaps what the part that was deleted was the fact that, that I said that we would reiterate \u2013 we wanted to reiterate that we are committed to growing net sales and operating income for our wine and spirits business in the 2% to 4% range in fiscal 2019, which is what our original guidance was, so. And then I think I was talking a little bit about appointing Jim Sabia, who is our beer marketing guy, historically to the position of Chief Marketing Officer for the whole company. So, I think that that\u2019s what was cut out. And then on Modelo Especial, I think that I was saying that we had double-digit depletions in Q1 and so we see everything to be all good with Modelo Especial. Like some other brands, March was a bit dicey in the beer industry as a general proposition, especially in California in our largest market, but I think that the good news there is that we outperformed everybody else probably to the same extent that we have in the past and we saw everything bounce back. And if you look at Modelo Especia\u2019s latest IRI, it\u2019s up 20%. So, we just don\u2019t see anything there that\u2019s indicative that our Mexican beer portfolio will perform in accordance with our guidance and in fact, we think it\u2019s performing above \u2013 a bit above our expectations at the current time. So, we are very optimistic in general about hitting both the beer guidance and the wine and spirits guidance. I will just talk a moment about the wine side of the business, which first quarter was weaker than we would have liked on the depletion front and that was largely due to a couple of factors, really two factors, number one, strong finish to last year, so I think that there was some timing there and some borrowing perhaps at retail from the first quarter, but nothing untoward and I think that we will see that made up as we go forward here. I think we will see depletions fundamentally performing at sort of the historical level and you have been looking sort of the 12-week or the 52-week and sort of see what that is. And then last year we had \u2013 we ran ourselves out of Meiomi and I say ran ourselves out of it was really due to the fact that sales were so stellar that we ran out of Meiomi and then we rebuilt that pipeline in the first quarter, as you recall we have like this, why are we good first quarter last year in wine and spirits. And so we are overlapping that still, which also accounted for some of the performance below expectations on wine and spirits for the first quarter, but we don\u2019t really see that necessarily impacting the whole year and we see the wine and spirits business performing in line with the market as we have been saying for quite a long time now and we don\u2019t see any real chinks in that armor. There is nothing happening with our brands that is contrary to what\u2019s been happening in the past. And in fact, we have got a lot of really strong marketing programs that are hitting strong promotional programs that are hitting our innovation pipeline on the wine and spirits side. I think it\u2019s the strongest than it\u2019s ever been. So, we are optimistic on wine and spirits as well. David Klein : And on the COGS question, Tim, so last year we finished with gross margins in the wine business kind of just sub 45% and then coming out of Q1 where we are just above 43%. We expect to grow our gross margins year-over-year in the wine business, so yes, that implies a combination of mix improvements some work we have done from an overhead and operational standpoint as well as blend improvements, which are inclusive of grape costs. Tim Ramey : Is it a fair statement that \u201817 was flat to down versus \u201816 in terms of grape costs? David Klein : Yes, I am not sure as it relates across \u2013 as it ties out across our portfolio, but we can get back to you on that. Tim Ramey : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Rob Sands : Hi, Bill. Bill Chappell : Hey, good morning. Just following back upon Premier and Familiar, you have given out the ACV numbers, can you just kind of give us some color of where you thought they were going to be this quarter, because you last reported 3 months ago and something happened obviously in the 3-month timeframe to pull forward the marketing, was it a big customer added more or was it just across the board, there was much more ACV than you had expected kind of going into the planning process, just trying to understand how, maybe it seems like it was a pretty quick shift and meaningful shift in a very short amount of time? So maybe even just from ACV, what you thought it would be? Rob Sands : So, Bill, we don\u2019t really plan ACV quite that specifically in terms of the numbers. So all I really say is I think that the numbers that I quoted were above what we expected, which basically means that we had more, even better retail take-up than we expected. I mean, it\u2019s sort of as simple as that. I\u2019d say like whether it\u2019s 300 basis points or 400 basis points or whatever and I think it would be sort of soft history to start talking about those numbers in hindsight. And then on the marketing, we did not pull it forward. We plan to do what we have done. In actuality, we thought that we had communicated that pretty specifically that we were going to be making significant investments behind the introduction of these new products in the first half of this year. We thought we had communicated that. And the only reason I\u2019d say I thought we communicated that, I think that people seem a little surprised about it. But to be clear, we didn\u2019t pull anything forward at all. We did exactly as we plan to do and there is no way around it, we have significant investment spending in the first quarter against these new products. The good news is, this is not a plan to invest money for some long-term \u2013 on some long-term basis that is immeasurable. We do think it\u2019s a very, very good investment for the long-term, but in terms of seeing our return on this investment, we expect to see the return on this investment this year. So, that\u2019s why \u2013 and we are seeing it and that\u2019s why we are confident in the guidance and that\u2019s why we were able to give the guidance that we gave in the first place, which we think is pretty robust performance for our company and for consumer goods company, I mean it still puts us, I mean, in a percentile that can hardly be measured. So, that\u2019s basically the story. Bill Chappell : That helps. So, it\u2019s just reading it and I understand what you are saying the comments at our conference maybe a few weeks ago was more of we said this before, we on the Street just didn\u2019t hear it clearly and so we are trying to reemphasize that. Is that the right way to think about that? Rob Sands : Yes, I would say that. And again I just reemphasized one thing in particular, which is we didn\u2019t do anything. Our explanation is not that we did something this quarter that we were fully planning to do. We did what we plan to do and based on our internal expectations things performed as well as we expected if not better. So, we are on track for our guidance for the full year. I mean, I guess in the end, you can wait and see how the year turns out rolling in the first quarter. Bill Chappell : Perfect. That\u2019s crystal clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning. Two quick ones. One, David on the FX effect on beer gross margins, just how much of a headwind was it in the first quarter and how much of a like tailwind given where the exchange rate is now be expected to be in the balance of the year? David Klein : Yes. So, there are really two components of FX was the small headwind to GP in Q1, but it was a larger headwind through at operating income, because we have as the peso weakened in the quarter and we have the reval or peso receivables with the biggest one being our VAT receivable, there was a reasonably sized SG&A drag on our beer business. So again, at the operating income line it was a larger drag than it was at the GP line. And then going forward we are about just over 80% hedged for the year at reasonably favorable rates and so actually the pace has been a bit volatile leading into the elections this weekend. So I would say it\u2019s probably too early to say, but we know we had a headwind in the first quarter and we are pretty confident it\u2019s a tailwind for the rest of the year and I guess the size will be determined on what happens maybe even in the election over the weekend. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. And then just one second one on Corona Premier, can you give us a sense of where it\u2019s sourcing its share from. So is it coming from domestic premium light, is it coming from above premium or even outside the sector, is it coming from spirits, just any sort of color or early indication you have of where it\u2019s pulling its consumers from? Thank you? Rob Sands : I would say, it\u2019s pretty much pulling its consumers from across domestic premium as a general proposition. So I think that your characterization of it is probably correct meaning it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s probably pulling its consumers from domestic premium lights and that kind of makes sense when you think about it, because it\u2019s a low calorie, low carbohydrate beer, I would say that it\u2019s primary competition, Michelob, also continues to perform well. So, yes, I don\u2019t think there is evidence that it\u2019s pulling necessarily from there, but Mic Ultra and I think Corona Premier is pulling from the premium light is probably the bottom line. People are drinking the light beer in the first place, aren\u2019t all of a sudden switching from non-light beer to light. There you made the decision that they weren\u2019t going to drink light, so I think that the simple logic would suggest that this is a premium choice for the already health conscious and light consumer. That\u2019s what I would believe. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. Thank you. Have a great weekend everyone. Rob Sands : You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Rob Sands : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Two quick things. One was just one brand you haven\u2019t mentioned, which is Pacifico outside of your prepared remarks and I know I get Nielsen data, which doesn\u2019t seem to be all that representative, IRI seem to do a better job for you guys, but Pacifico even as the weather improved looks to not be performing terribly well again in the scanner data. I was just surprised to see that as you are kicking off the national launch of the 12-pack on the TV. So I would just be curious to hear any commentary on Pacifico performance and what the scanner might be missing? And then also just on the distribution footprint, so there is the trade press, the gossipy stuff isn\u2019t a lot of chatter about some changes you guys have been making in your distributor footprint. So, any color you could offer there on what\u2019s been driving decision-making process and if there is any records to be set straight versus what\u2019s kind of been reported again in the trade press would be great? Thank you. Rob Sands : Sure. So, first of all, on Pacifico, Pacifico is almost in the vast, vast majority of it is very regional in largely Southern California. So, it was probably affected by the weather in Southern California in the earlier part of the quarter to a greater extent than others. If you look at the performance outside of Southern California, it continues to perform at double-digits. And in general, it\u2019s looking very good. We see no real issue with Pacifico other than that. That market has been \u2013 was pretty weak in the first quarter and Pacifico was affected by it, but it continues to be a very strong brand that I think that we have very high hopes for and we don\u2019t see anything dashing those of. Now, on the distributor question, number one I would say that we have the best distribution network in the country, we call it the Gold Network, we call it the Gold Network for a reason, because it\u2019s like making gold, it\u2019s as simple as that. The one change that we made in Southern California was the only one change. So I think that characterizing it as some kind of change in our distributor footprint in general or some kind of change in our philosophy of how we deal with or treat our distributor partners is simply incorrect, I think that it was kind of interesting news and there is a lot of pundits that we have a lot to say about it. But the fact of the matter is, is that it was one change in a market and the change made a lot of sense, because we were able in that particular market to give that territory to another one of our very important distributor partners. So, that change as I said made a lot of sense to us. Interestingly, I think that the trade press glossed over another change that we made, which I think is very significant and probably more significant, which is the fact that we gave our entire wine and spirits business in the Pacific Northwest, i.e., Washington and Oregon to our longtime beer distributor up there at Columbia, which I think is an interesting thing, because it is aligned with our total beverage alcohol strategy, not that, that\u2019s necessarily something that we intend to do either on a broader base and so in either case, it\u2019s just simply not appropriate to extrapolate what we did in either one of those cases necessarily to any broader, I\u2019d say, point about the network other than what we did in those specific instances. So, we have a great relationship with our wholesalers. We are the company that\u2019s really providing 100% of their growth in many cases now, especially as you see craft having slowed down a bit. And I have to say that the results that we have achieved in our beer business and that we continue to achieve in our beer business is in a large part due to the efforts and the investment and really the skill of what we call our Gold Network and those distributors. So, the only thing I would say is you can\u2019t take one move and extrapolate it to mean anything whatsoever in a network that has 500 or 600 distributors across the entire United States, there is always something going on in stock market relative to the network. And I would say we have better relationships than anybody. I would say we will have better relationships than anybody and I would say that the network is completely intact and a very, very strong network. They may change the name of it from the Gold Network to the Platinum Network in fact. Lauren Lieberman : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Amit, your line is open. Please state your question. Rob Sands : Well, that\u2019s an easy question to answer, Amit. Operator : Sir, your phone is on mute, please un-mute it. There is no response from that line. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks. Rob Sands : Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining our call today. Let me just reiterate that our business prospects remain very strong and I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are confident in achieving our full year goals as we are expecting a strong back half to the fiscal year. As the July 4 holiday approaches, I hope that everybody gets to enjoy some of our fine beer, wine and spirits products at your celebrations with family and friends. So, thanks everybody and have a fantastic rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands\u2019 first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to Constellation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s second quarter sales and earnings results. I would like to kick off the call with a reminder that Constellation has an outstanding core business that consistently delivers top tier growth within the consumers\u2019 product space as reinforced by our second quarter double-digit organic net sales and comparable EPS results. These results were driven by the Constellation beer business, which delivered exceptional performance with industry-leading depletion growth of 10% and record operating margin results. During the quarter, our beer business was the number one share gainer in the U.S. beer industry driven by accelerating Corona brand family dollar trends and Modelo Especial\u2019s position as the top share gainer in the market. Corona brand family trends accelerated from 4% depletion growth in fiscal 2018 to 8% for this year\u2019s first half driven by the successful launches of the Corona Premier and Corona Familiar product introductions, both of which have significantly exceeded our expectations. Corona Premier has achieved record speed-to-shelf and has become the 10th largest brand in the high-end and the number one high-end share gainer in very, very short order. The incrementality rate for Corona Premier is best-in-class for the launch of a new consumer product, with almost 75% of Corona Premier volume being sourced outside the Constellation beer portfolio, mostly from domestic light beers. The Corona Premier English and Spanish language TV campaigns that aired throughout the first half of the year will continue into the fall to drive broad brand awareness during major league baseball as well as the NFL and NHL seasons. Corona Familiar also achieved a healthy share of the U.S. beer category and its regional expansion at a rate of about 50% incrementality for the brand with velocities outpacing our plans. Corona Extra continues to provide the strong foundation needed for the portfolio to grow with strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54. There continues to be plenty of runway for future Corona Extra growth with incremental contributions from draft and canned format as well as the Cornita [ph] product, and we continue to see growing household penetration with Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers. The Casa Modelo family of brands has been the number one growth driver in the U.S. beer category with a CAGR of almost 20% for the last 5 years. The Modelo Especial power brand with volume of 100 million cases last year continues to be on fire capturing not only the top spot as the number one growth brand but also the number one share gainer in the total U.S. beer industry during the second quarter. To sustain this incredible momentum, we are increasing the media investment for Modelo Especial in the second half to drive additional demand especially during the football season and the holidays. During the quarter, we purchased Four Corners Brewing, local Dallas craft brewery whose bicultural brand, inspired flavors, capitalized on one of the hottest trends in beer, Hispanic influenced products. This high performing brand has grown sales 5x since 2014. Our new brand entrants in test markets within the alternative beverage alcohol space are doing exceptionally well as a growing market opportunity that has been incremental to the beer category. Corona Refresca is exceeding our expectations in current test markets with early indicators suggesting that this product is at least 80% incremental to our portfolio. As a result, we are planning a phased national rollout beginning next spring with the focus on retail chain space. And the new SVEDKA Spiked Premium Seltzer, which is also seeing excellent results in Northeast test markets has planned and expanded rollout next spring in select markets. From an operational perspective, during the quarter we continued the new expansion phase at our Obregon brewery with detailed design and site work in various phases of completion. The phase \u2013 the final phase of the 30 million hectoliter expansion project at Nava is on track as we add capacity for production, fermentation, and filtration with completion planned for the end of fiscal 2019. Our Nava glass plant, which we are already underway with work on, the batch house and furnace foundation in anticipation of the build-out of furnace #5 which we expect to complete by the end of calendar 2019, and construction continues at Mexicali with warehouse and packaging buildings nearly complete. Overall, I am excited about the existing momentum and the ongoing growth prospects for our beer business. We remain committed to delivering industry-leading targets for this business with net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range for fiscal 2019. Moving to wine and spirits, our wine and spirits business benefited from strong shipment volume growth in the second quarter to ensure that the portfolio is well positioned for a head start to our peak selling period when we believe that freight lanes may be in short supply. We are performing particularly well in the greater than $11 price point at retail, a level that is driving much of the overgrowth \u2013 overall growth in the U.S. wine industry. Our attention to this higher retail price point is paying off as we posted depletion growth of more than 6% for this price segment during the second quarter with Meiomi, Kim Crawford, SIMI, and Prisoner Focus Brands all posting solid growth trends. I would like to remind everyone that our total Focus Brands portfolio currently represents more than 70% of the net sales and profitability for the wine and spirits business. This collection of brands has also consistently grown at a rate of 3x to 4x the U.S. market rate. Our high-end spirits brands like High West, which is also included in our Focus Brands delivered accelerating depletion growth of almost 35% for the quarter driven by American Prairie Reserve and Double Rye! with Casa Noble tequila posting second quarter depletion growth of almost 15%. Current initiatives are also driving growth with successes like Clos du Bois Lightly Bubbled Chardonnay, Black Box Sangria, and our collection of newly introduced Rose brands, including Meiomi, Kim Crawford, and Band of Roses. Our innovation pipeline is already planned for the upcoming holiday selling season with new brands like Meiomi Sparkling, Cooper & Thief Rye Barrel Aged Cabernet, The Snitch, a new Prisoner brand chardonnay as well as Black Box spirits which will continue to expand in the phase rollout. While our fiscal 2019 wine and spirits guidance of net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4% range remains intact, we\u2019re facing some challenges with the low end of our portfolio that make our targets challenging to achieve. The U.S. wine market is slow particularly at the less than 11% retail price point and our non-Focus Brands are in decline. Therefore, while we continue to focus on initiatives to drive growth at the higher end, we\u2019re also developing plans and considering options to optimize value at the low end of the portfolio so that we can direct our innovation and investment dollars to Focus Brands particularly those at the greater than $11 price point. We have plans in place for the remainder of the year to improve our COGS management capabilities with planned initiatives for yield improvement, production efficiencies, blend optimization and procurement savings. We expect these initiatives to offset some of the headwinds we continue to face including higher transportation and credit costs. In addition, we will continue to support our innovation plans and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year especially during the key holiday selling season with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. Now before turning the call over to David, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to walk you through the strategic rationale and highlights of Constellation\u2019s pending investment in Canopy Growth and why we believe that Canopy is the best partner to align with in the cannabis space. With our focus on continuous growth, we\u2019ve recognized the significant opportunity that the emerging cannabis space presents as potentially one of the most significant global growth opportunities of the next decade. Our incremental $4 billion investment increases our interest in Canopy to approximately 35% and include warrants that provide us with the option to take our ownership position to greater than 50% over time. This will be the largest investment to-date in the cannabis space, a market which is expected to reach more than $200 billion in retail sales globally within the next 15 years and one that is opening up much more rapidly than originally anticipated. So why Canopy Growth? Canopy is the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and the leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. We work closely with Canopy throughout the last year to better understand the cannabis market, the unbelievable opportunity it presents and Canopy\u2019s market-leading capabilities in the space. With world-class expertise in R&D, innovation, product development, scaled production and international expansion, Canopy is poised to capitalize on the emerging global cannabis opportunity. They have already established a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy Growth has the largest legal cannabis production footprint in the world and in Canada, and they are the only producer currently participating in all Canadian provinces. They also have been awarded approximately 35% of the supply contracts announced throughout all Canadian provinces to-date that are dedicated to recreational cannabis, a market that will become legal in Canada later this month. Going forward, we will be working exclusively with Canopy as we believe that having a single platform to address all markets and formats globally is essential to winning in this space. Canopy plans to use the investment proceeds to bolster their global leadership position in the Canopy \u2013 cannabis industry by building or acquiring key assets needed to establish global scale. Strategic priorities beyond Canada include the U.S. in the nearly 30 countries presently pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis program. In addition, Canopy plans to focus on intellectual property development across medical and recreational opportunities while also preparing and creating brands and products for new recreational cannabis markets. Canopy has a portfolio of the most recognized cannabis brands in Canada and they are building a suite of new offerings across various product formats that will be sold through new and existing channels. A strong online platform currently supports Canopy\u2019s ongoing direct to patient medical business and they are building a network of brick-and-mortar stores across Canada as they ramp up for participation in the legalized recreational market. Canopy\u2019s shareholders recently approved their pending transaction and I look forward to working with Bruce Lin and his Canopy team who have built a phenomenal business. As the growth leader in total beverage alcohol space, we expect to reap the benefits of our cannabis investment, which we see as being incremental to our core beer, wine and spirits portfolio. I am very excited about the excellent prospects for this business as the global cannabis space emerges. In summary, I am pleased that we have been able to increase our EPS guidance range for the year based on our year-to-date results and the plans we have in place for the remainder of the year. Given Constellation\u2019s leadership position in the high-end U.S. beer market further runway for margin expansion throughout the business, unique leverage to the emerging cannabis space and an attractive valuation, I believe Constellation will continue to be a multiyear double-digit EPS compounder. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the quarter. David? David Klein : Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. For Q2, we generated 16% comparable basis diluted EPS growth. This reflects particularly strong operational and marketplace performance by our beer business during the key summer selling season. These results along with favorability in our tax rate and interest expense have allowed us to narrow and increase our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection to a range of $9.60 to $9.75 versus our previous guidance of $9.40 to $9.70. This excludes the impact of the additional $4 billion investment in Canopy growth, which is expected to close at the end of October. We plan to finance the Canopy investment, primarily with term loans and senior notes and estimate the interest expense associated with this transaction to approximate $60 million with an approximate $0.25 to $0.30 impact on fiscal \u201819 comparable basis EPS results. Our Q2 reported basis results reflect a $692 million unrealized gain for the increase in fair value of our current investments in Canopy growth during the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. The cumulative unrealized gain since our November 2017 investment is $1.3 billion. Now, let\u2019s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 9%. Depletion growth showed continued strength at 10% as we won the key summer selling season with excellent execution across all channels. Beer operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 41.3% as benefits from pricing and strong operational performance were offset by higher transportation costs and marketing investments. Marketing as a percent of revenue increased to almost 9% for Q2 and to nearly 10% for the first half of fiscal \u201819. This compares to 8.4% and 9% for Q2 and first half of fiscal \u201818. The increases are primarily due to the upfront marketing investments for the Corona Premier and Corona Familiar introductions as well as ongoing investments to sustain the growth momentum within the portfolio. Marketing spend came in lower for Q2 than our previous estimate as we decided to shift some planned spend into Q3. We continue to target fiscal \u201819 marketing as a percent of net sales in the range of 9.5% to 10%. Back half marketing spend is expected to be weighted toward Q3 and approximate 11% to 12% of revenue as part of our brand building efforts during the important fall sports season. I would also note that beer segment depreciation for the first half of fiscal \u201819 increased $21 million to $100 million. For fiscal \u201819, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Full year beer operating margin is expected to be similar to the prior year\u2019s 39.5% result. For the year, we continue to expect to increase gross margin, even with the headwinds from higher transportation costs. From a quarter perspective, Q3 operating margin is expected to be below the prior year third quarter and Q4 above the prior year fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of marketing spend that I just outlined. Moving to wine and spirits, we saw strong Q2 U.S. shipment volume drive net sales growth of 9%. The U.S. shipment volume outpaced the U.S. depletion volume primarily due to timing as we positioned ourselves for success ahead of the key holiday selling season as we expect freight lanes and carriers to remain in tight supply. We expect most of the shipment timing benefit experienced during the second quarter to reverse in the third quarter and as a result, we expect our third quarter wine and spirits net sales and operating income to be down low single-digits. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 26.1%. This decline primarily reflects higher COGS, mostly due to increased grape and transportation costs and marketing investments for key Focus Brands and innovation initiatives, which was mostly offset by favorable pricing in SG&A. As a reminder, the 2015 Opus One Vintage to be released this fall is expected to be smaller than the previous year. Therefore, Q3 fiscal \u201819 equity earnings from Opus will be below Q3 last year. Even though the lower end of the wine and spirits market and our depletion performance has been challenging during the first half of fiscal 2019, we are still expecting fiscal \u201819 wine and spirits net sales and operating income growth of 2.4% or 2% to 4% driven by continued focus on our portfolio premiumization efforts and productivity enhancements across the business. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects investments in people to support our growth organization and our digital enablement and Fit for Growth initiatives. Interest expense increased 8% primarily due to higher average debt balances. Excluding the projected impact of additional debt to fund our pending Canopy growth investment, we now expect fiscal \u201819 interest expense to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million. The decrease in our interest expense guidance of approximately $20 million primarily reflects interest favorability at our glass joint venture partially offset by an increase in the net income attributable to the non-controlling interest line of our income statement, which we now expect to be approximately $20 million to $25 million for fiscal \u201819. As mentioned earlier, we expect incremental interest expense related to the funding of the Canopy growth investment to be in the $60 million range for fiscal \u201819. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of August totaled $9.7 billion, a $379 million decrease from our net debt balance at the end of fiscal \u201818. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.4x at the end of August from 3.6x at the end of fiscal \u201818, while we continued to invest in our Mexican operations and return cash to shareholders, with $504 million of stock repurchases and $279 million of dividends paid during the first half of the year. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 18.4% versus 20.6% last year. The decrease reflects benefits from tax reform and lower taxes on our foreign earnings partially offset by a lower stock-based compensation tax benefit. For fiscal \u201819, we now expect the effective tax rate to approximate 18% versus our previous guidance of 19%. The lower tax rate for Q2 and the lower rate projected for the full year is primarily the result of lower taxes on our foreign earnings. This is being driven largely by a structure change in the foreign legal entities that reduced certain tax accruals. Most of this decrease will not be recurring. I would also note that we expect stock-based compensation tax benefits to be weighted toward Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year rate at around 21% to 22%. We also now expect fiscal \u201819 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $196 million. This reflects the estimated impact of our year-to-date share repurchases. We don\u2019t plan to make additional share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal \u201819 as we will focus on de-levering after completing the additional investment in Canopy. As a result of the aforementioned factors, we now expect our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $960 to $975. Our comparable basis adjustment excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. It also excludes any impact related to the pending additional Canopy growth investment. After completion of the transaction, we expect to account for investment in the original and new shares of Canopy under the equity accounting method. At the date of the transaction close, the equity investment, original and new shares, will be reflected on our balance sheet. Accordingly, this portion of our Canopy investments will not change in subsequent periods due to the fluctuations in the value of Canopy\u2019s stock price and the equity earnings for our share of Canopy earnings will be reported on a 2-month lag. In addition, our Canopy warrants, original and new, will be recorded at fair value and we will continue to exclude changes in the fair value of the warrants from our comparable basis earnings. We continue to evaluate potential comparable adjustments related to the transaction and the impact on equity warnings to fiscal \u201819 results. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated strong free cash flow of $968 million for the first half of fiscal \u201819 compared to $598 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow growth and lower CapEx. The lower CapEx is primarily due to timing as we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion remains unchanged and we continue to expect fiscal \u201819 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. In closing, we are focused on our portfolio premiumization and innovation activities, while working to drive productivity enhancements across our wine and spirits business. Our beer business continues to deliver impressive operational, marketplace and financial performance. These efforts have positioned us to continue generating top-tier sales and profit growth for this year and beyond. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog : Alright. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to ask you guys a little bit more about your beer margins in the quarter which were strong and quite a bit above what you were guiding. So, could you drill down just a little bit more on some of the drivers there? And then just want to get a sense on your expectations for the full year, is it fair to assume that beer margins will in fact be higher now given some of the strength we are seeing? Thanks. Rob Sands : \u2013: Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Beer looked pretty spectacular, and I do note that you didn\u2019t spend as much as you expected on marketing and yet you\u2019ve got a really strong depletion growth. So, I am wondering if you can look out for us a little further and just talk about what sort of legs you think Premier has, and the incrementality seems to be even higher than we originally thought at 75, not 70. Has there been any supply shortage on Premier? Do you think you can sell significantly more over time, and how is Familiar playing out? And again, just a little more detail on the other new initiatives you have in beer would be great? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes, Caroline. I think that we can say at this stage that all of our NPD in beer and in particular, Premier and Familiar, has been performing extremely well. And as you noted, the incrementality on Premier and Familiar has outpaced our expectations. So, we did frontload some of our spending on marketing this year as you probably recall in the first quarter, which we had highlighted even prior to the first quarter and that marketing spend I think has really paid off for all of our initiatives. As you can see, in that the Corona brand family and the Modelo, Casa Modelo family have been performing extremely well, both as reflected by our depletions and as reflected in IRI. I would say that we don\u2019t really see any reason why that momentum should not continue throughout the remainder of the year enabling us to make the guidance which we put forth of roughly 9% to 11%. So generally, I would say that the beer business is hitting on all cylinders. Strong consumer takeaway, our marketing is working really well, incrementality on our new products is higher than expected, we have been able to achieve distribution on those products to a greater extent than we even believed that we would be able to achieve. So, there is really nothing in the horizon that would suggest that the beer business won\u2019t do anything other than to achieve the guidance that we have put forth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Rob Sands : Good morning. Kevin Grundy : \u2013: Rob Sands : Thanks. Kevin Grundy : I wanted to come back to Canopy, Rob, if we could. Rob Sands : Yes. Kevin Grundy : Can you talk about what you\u2019ve learned, I guess, in recent months since you announced the larger stake, anything that makes you bullish or bearish? There\u2019s naturally a lot of questions out there among investors. Can you also talk about potential timing and other considerations around the decision to exercise the warrants at some point in the future? And last, understanding you may be limited given that Canopy is obviously publicly traded, is there anything you can provide with respect to near to intermediate term impact from equity earnings from the investment? Thanks for that. Rob Sands : Yes. So, I would say that if anything we continue to be extremely bullish, if not more bullish since we have announced the deal. I mean, we are right on the cusp in the next couple of weeks of recreational marijuana becoming legal in Canada on October 17. I would say that the overall market projections on that haven\u2019t really changed. I think some \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty wide spread, but I think that most people are predicting somewhere in the $5 billion market wise in Canada, $5 billion to $6 billion or $7 billion range for legal recreational cannabis. As I noted in my script, Canopy has secured approximately 35% of the supply contract, so we expect to take a significant share of that business as it develops over the next call it 12 to 18 to 24 months. So, I think we\u2019re feeling pretty good about Canopy\u2019s position and the results or how that position will be reflected in the results. No, we don\u2019t \u2013 we really haven't given any guidance on the equity earnings as of yet, I think that we really need to take a little bit more of a latency approach to that element of our guidance in the future. So, once I think that we get recreational, it becomes legal and we get a little history under our belt, we\u2019ll be able to address that better as time goes on. I think that another thing that shouldn\u2019t be lost on anybody is that Canopy has significant positions outside of Canada and that those markets are developing very quickly and Canopy is extremely well-positioned to take leading positions in major markets where medical in particular is going to become legal. And the \u2013 that the history of a lot of markets which is a little different than the United States is that, first medical becomes legal, which is why we want to participate in that category and the governments then are able to establish the regulatory bodies, the regulatory frameworks sort of settle in with that reality and then recreational follows after the governments have as I said establish their oversight mechanisms. We see that happening largely all over the world in very large countries like Germany, in the UK and Western Europe in general, and we\u2019re poised through Canopy to participate in all of that. That said, I think something that David has said all along, we premised our investment really solely on Canada and the countries that Canopy already had a strong foothold in, and we see nothing to suggest that our returns on those investments won\u2019t be as we expected. United States, we pretty much counted nothing, but things are moving very quickly in the United States on the legal front. It looks like perhaps after the election we\u2019ll see the Farm Bill, enacted the Farm Bill legalizes CBD, and that will be an interesting market to see how that develops in the US, which will be poised to participate in. And there was certainly a lot of talk that eventually there will be some form of decriminalization of marijuana at the federal level meaning that taking of it off the schedule one list and therefore really leaving it to the states to determine the legality, and of course, that\u2019s moving quickly too with two states having the recreational legality on the ballot this November and eight states already having made it recreationally legal and a large \u2013 those states are big states. So, a large percentage of the population in the United States already in states where it\u2019s recreationally legal. So, we think that we\u2019re by far the best company in the world or in the best position in the world of any company to capitalize on what is absolutely without a doubt going to be a huge market over the next 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. So, we\u2019re addressing our position on every front meaning that we need to be a key player in the development of the science, that\u2019s really important. Branding, we have got top people and top agencies and firms working on branding, because like all businesses of this nature and consumer products, branding is going to be the key to success of the future. And we are leaving no stones unturned in any of those areas through our Canopy investment and also with regard to our Constellation folks who are dedicated to that element of our business. So we are excited. We see very positive future in that regard. Kevin Grundy : Thank you very much. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the wine business and suggest any color you can offer, I know you definitely specified kind of the below $11 price point above $11 price point performance of your focus brands, but I was curious on overall category performance and then also the difference between high end and low end. And the Nielsen data or IRI data seems to show no correlation to your business at all, so if you could just commented on why you think that is the same mix of what\u2019s available in those channels. And my final question was just the price mix in that business year-to-date is less than 1% and I would have thought that mix alone should be driving that line to be pretty positive, so if you could talk about anything that might be a downdraft in terms of actual pricing in the business or promotional activity will be great? Thank you. Rob Sands : Yes. So I would say that the \u2013 if you look at the wine business in the U.S. over the long run, it\u2019s been consistently growing at sort of the low or to mid single-digit range. And although it\u2019s off a bit from that or at least the near-term historical performance, we don\u2019t really see anything that suggest that as the entire category over the long run is going to grow at any rate different from what it has historically which is significantly above almost all other consumer products categories. So I think it remains a very strong category to participate in. There continues to be significant premiumization in the business with the low end becoming softer as time goes on and it\u2019s a very large segment. And the high end continues to perform well certainly above $11 with growth in the high single-digit range and sometimes in the lower double-digit range. And obviously we continue to position our portfolio to take advantage of that, at the same time our lower end portfolio also continues to I would say deteriorate consistent with the market and we certainly in terms of how we are running the business, focusing all of efforts on our focus brands and on the high end we have all of our NPD against the high end. And we are certainly taking our results in the low end and I will say reinvesting that in the high end to accelerate the mix change. So I would say the first half of the year for us on a depletion basis was kind of lackluster, but we have lot of plans and programs in place for the holiday season and the remainder of the year, so we are expecting to see significantly better depletion growth in the second half of the year based on how we timed our programming. We do expect to see better leverage as a result of the premiumization meaning we expect to see our premium brands outpace our popular price brands, which should drive some positive mix. So generally we are favorable about the business going into the second half and hence we have maintained our guidance of 2% to 4% on the top line and the bottom line which I think will be pretty good result. I would say that the wine business in general the wine and spirits business is the strong business. As I said both the category outpaces consumer products in general. If you look at margins our margins in the wine business if it\u2019s still alone everybody would think it was a great business, it all looks like an ugly step-child in comparison to the beer business which there is basically no company in the world of any size that\u2019s performing like our beer business across the top line and with the kind of margins that we have in that business. I mean it\u2019s really a unique business in terms of the kind of totally outstanding performance it\u2019s generating. So it is a little \u2013 there is a little bit of relativity involved in that. People are very focused as they should be on the beer business and it tends to perhaps overshadow the wine business which continues to be a very good business. So our focused brands constitute about 70% of the business. We have got good growth in the focused brands, the above the $11 segment continues to grow in the high single-digits and our business is actually outpacing that. In IRI the high single-digit growth we gained share in other words in the above $11 segment. And that\u2019s really where all of our focus is. We have got strong operating ROIC in the wine business, high double-digits and in general say that the business is performing well plus our TBA, Total Beverage Alcohol platform I think is really paying off. Some of the things that I think have been lost in terms of what the press has been reporting are things like the entire Pacific Northwest where we consolidated our wine, beer and spirits business in one distributor, Columbia millions of millions of cases. And that consolidation has actually gone extremely well. Columbia has done a fantastic job on the wine side and we have seen accelerating results through Columbia in particular. So we have also done a lot of interesting things in that for instance our SVEDKA Seltzers, SVEDKA being a spirits brand which historically and continues to go through the wine and spirits distribution network we have created the seltzer product which is malt based which we therefore had put through our beer network. So we are binding all kinds of ways that we can use our very, very strong position in both networks to drive our business. And then retail \u2013 most retailers have single organization that deals entirely with or deals with all beverage alcohol. The may split it up, below the top people, but they are looking at their beverage alcohol category continues to be the most important category at retail because this is the most profitable and has the most growth of the other large categories and Constellation continues to be the number one growth provider by a factor of probably 3 to 1 at retail with our beverage alcohol portfolio. So we are the ones who are driving all of the growth or a large percentage of the growth at retail for the retailers, that puts us in a very strong position. And as I often like to say about our sales guys where I say to our sales guys when they are going and talking to retailers, that\u2019s our story you can\u2019t make up, okay. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that when you have those kind of bets at hand when you are going in and talking to our retail customers. And we can say straight out that we are the number one growth provider by far and therefore the squeaky wheel ought to get the grease. That is a great story versus going in hand and hand and having them not generating any growth in fact having to deal with how are you going to explain the declines and the continuing declines and trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear. So I think we are in very good shape across the board. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Vivien Azer : Thank you. Good morning. Rob Sands : Hey, Vivien. Vivien Azer : So, Rob and David, I was wondering, is you\u2019re working with Canopy Growth and presumably helping them with some of the forecasting exercises, which is admittedly a tough exercise trying to size an illicit market transition. But as part of that exercise, is there any discussion around alcohol cannibalization, is that part of the calculus at all? Thanks. Rob Sands : No. I would say straight-out, the answer is no. We see no evidence whatsoever especially in the United States and the legal states of alcohol cannibalization. So, I\u2019d say as we sit here right now when we think about the cannabis business and our position in the cannabis business, it\u2019s probably going to be close to a 100% incremental for us talking about incrementality. So, this conversation comes up a lot of two things, okay, number one is it a defensive move, the answer is no. We\u2019re not playing offense, defense, we\u2019re playing offense. This is an offensive move. We\u2019ve got a fantastic core business and as you can see from these results and our projected results on our core business for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re very positive, we have a lot of confidence in that business and we see nothing in the horizon that suggests that it\u2019s going to be anything other than great as its continued to be. We\u2019re playing offense on this and that we think that this is another very aligned category, that\u2019s going to develop very fast and very large and it simply presents another opportunity for growth for Constellation in addition to our core business. Why would we do this, okay, we did it because first of all, we got to involve with Canopy in a joint venture to develop beverages, okay. As that progressed, it became evident to us that the whole market, all channels, all forms is going to be explosive and therefore, there was really no reason why we should only participate in a relatively small segment of that market, which is beverages when other channels i.e. medical for instance and other forms are going to develop very quickly around the world and we have a \u2013 and we had a platform, which we had a minority interest in that we can take advantage of. So, as we said, we\u2019re completely optimistic, it\u2019s completely offensive on our part. We didn\u2019t do it because we have any concern whatsoever about the core business, I\u2019ve heard that suggestion made. I can tell you that our core business is stronger than ever and that had no bearing on why we did this, totally offensive, totally incremental, another leg of the stool that Constellation can add to continue as probably the number one growth company in consumer products in the Fortune 500. So that\u2019s really the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, hello everybody and congrats on the results. Rob Sands : Thanks. Andrea Teixeira : I do appreciate the color on the beer margin and the cadence going forward. So, my question is on the beer pricing, I understand the negotiations are taking place now. So is your guidance embedded in the typical low single-digit pricing and what are you hearing from the training in terms of passing on aluminum and transportation cost pressures. So, if you can \u2013 and if you can also offer, there's a lot of news I mean, press release is about or press comments about hearing some noise in terms of beer distributors consolidation along with the wine distributors as well. So, I think Rob you mentioned that, that has been productive on the wine side. So, I wonder if you can offer us some comfort on the beer as well? Thank you. David Klein : So, I\u2019ll take the pricing and I leave the second question to Rob. But \u2013 so from a pricing standpoint, yes, the letters are in the market. We\u2019re not seeing any pushback, it seems \u2013 the market seems fairly conducive to price increases this year especially maybe compared to over the last several years. And our full year guidance includes the benefits that we expect to receive from the price increases that we are putting out at this point. Rob Sands : Yes. And I would parrot what David said in that regard. Our pricing continues to be as it has been in the past completely normal in that 1% to 2% range. The environment for that pricing is probably I would put it as better as opposed to worse if you were just saying how is the market absorbing price increases, I would say we are on the better end of that scale this year than we have even better on the past where it hasn\u2019t been a significant issue. On the distributor consolidations and my comments on wine, in the Northwest we consolidated wine, beer and spirits and while I was focusing on wine that whole consolidation across wine, beer and spirits and for beer as well has worked very well as we are a major, major player with that distributor. As to some of our moves in really Southern California that had done it in the press, it\u2019s really about very specific instances and examples in some of our most core markets where we have the highest market shares, where consolidation provides an opportunity to create significant efficiencies especially in distribution otherwise that will directly benefit our brands in those areas where we have consolidated by taking some of those efficiencies that have been created and being able to apply those against our brands in terms of manpower on the street, in terms of marketing dollars that can be available at local levels against those brands. So these were moves really intended to accelerate what is already good performance. And I would say one of the hallmarks about Constellation and what I am about to say even relates to the Canopy transaction is we are not a company that\u2019s sitting around waiting for some element of our business to turn down or get bad before we jump in and we take action to improve our results. We are really quite the opposite of that. We have a fantastic business. It\u2019s performing better than it\u2019s ever performed in the past. And we are really applying all of our thought and effort against actually accelerating the great position that we are in as opposed to sitting around waiting for it to turn bad and then we are all going to jump in with some kind of fix it attitude, because that\u2019s too late in business. When it turns bad, turning something around is a 900x harder than it is to play off that\u2019s from an already very strong position. So that\u2019s a lot of our mentality and a lot of the things that we are doing both in our core business something like our distributor consolidation moves in Southern Cal, it\u2019s truly about playing offense and accelerating an already strong business platform. Andrea Teixeira : That makes a lot of sense. Thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi everyone. Rob Sands : Hi Judy. Judy Hong : So on beer sales guidance 9% to 11% not changing despite the fact that you have 11% year-to-date, I don\u2019t think that second half comparisons are that different than the first half, so I guess I am just curious sort of the decision not to raise at least the low end of that, is it just conservatism, is there anything that we should be mindful of. And then a little bit of more of the longer term question, as you are lapping some of the innovation benefit this year particularly on Premier and Familiar just given the success of those products, how do you think about sort of the lapping that innovation into 2019 or fiscal \u201820? Is your expectation that we will see continued growth of those innovations really being still a big contributor or do you think that other innovations like the Refresca and others have to kind of carry the load going forward just from a contribution standpoint? David Klein : \u2013 : Rob Sands : Yes. And I guess I would add that your questions, Judy, almost presume the answers. We will be overlapping the distribution games on some of the new products. On the other hand, we are going to turn our attention then to building velocity on those new products. And as we build velocity on those new products that will provide some incremental performance that will help offset the overlap question that you asked. Refresca is looking like it\u2019s going to be a huge opportunity for us. I think you all know that the alternative category is really one of the stellar performers in the beer category overall with numerous brands now performing extremely well. So we think that that\u2019s a big opportunity in that. We think that Corona Refresca certainly based on our test markets and given the strength of the Corona franchise and the Corona name and the continued demographic tailwinds that we have in the business, I think that Refresca is a huge opportunity. And then let\u2019s not forget about some of the secondary brands like Pacifico, which continues to be a huge opportunity like even Victoria. Take a look at IRI on Victoria, okay. Victoria is growing now high double-digits. So I think that in the beer business in general, not only do we have the opportunity to drive velocity on some of our NPD that\u2019s already in the marketplace, we have new NPD that\u2019s going to go national, i.e., Refresca, which is going to give us more growth opportunities. And then we have the smaller secondary brands that we can jump to as well to continue to provide strong growth against the whole portfolio. And then you have got Modelo Especial, which is a huge brand already and continues to grow high double-digits. So, we really see opportunity across that whole portfolio. On the wine and spirits side, we have brands like High West that are growing wildly and spirits brands like Casa Noble tequila and wine brands that are really unparalleled in terms of the potential for both like the Prisoner, like Kim Crawford, which is already a very large and profitable brand, just to name a couple. I could name many more, but I would say that therefore the opportunities across the whole portfolio remain very strong. Judy Hong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Sharma : Hi, good morning everyone. Rob Sands : Good morning. Amit Sharma : Dave, quick question for you and one for Rob. Dave, so as pricing goes through as you are saying, as pricing regs are in the marketplace already. Your gross margins are already tracking around a year ago level, maybe little bit higher, why shouldn\u2019t we expect a little bit more contribution on gross margin as pricing comes through right? And then Rob, you talked CBD and how the Farm Bill could accelerate legalization of at least that aspect of the cannabis. Can you give us a little bit of understanding of if you are planning on bringing a product based on CBD, is that going to be in partnership with Canopy, so you only derive equity income or could that come directly under Constellation? David Klein : Yes. So on the gross margin question, I think you are hearing this from everybody else in the industry with the headwinds on freight and little bit of headwinds in some of the commodity areas. And so we think that our operations team is doing an outstanding job to be able to deliver a quarter, where we have best ever gross margins in that kind of headwind environment and we expect that environment will continue for the rest of the year, but as we said we also believe that our gross margins in our beer business will expand albeit slightly, but will expand over the full year. And then we have incremental marketing spend to continue to drive our brands, which brings us back to the place where our operating margins are roughly in line with the prior year. We think by the way that\u2019s the best way to grow the business, because we are focused on driving that top line growth in a business that has almost 40% operating margins we want to keep as much growth coming as we possibly can. Rob Sands : Yes. And to your next question, the answer is both. It could be reflected in the Canopy equity earnings as well as directly in Constellation. So, number one just to be clear, Canopy is one of the largest CBD producers in the world. So, it\u2019s very possible that depending on exactly how the law works and whether imports are permittable, the CBD could well come from Canopy and then assuming that we produce CBD beverages and they can be sold through the normal retail channels, obviously, maybe not to everyone, but to us, the product would be distributed through wine, beer and spirits network to retailers. So obviously that element of it would be reflected in Constellation\u2019s business. So, the answer is really both that it has the potential to be reflected in the equity earnings, with Canopy already being one of the biggest CBD producers in the world and in Constellation\u2019s earnings as we potentially introduce CBD beverage, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s alcoholic, probably not through our wine, beer and spirits networks. Amit Sharma : Rob, can you just give us a little bit color on the potential size of that market of the CBD? Rob Sands : I can\u2019t really speculate on that at this point. I don\u2019t think that there is a lot of prognostication on exactly what the size of that market is in the United States. I would say given the chatter about companies like Coca-Cola looking at it as well, I would say that it could be immaterial or tiny if other major beverage companies are looking at it as well. So, I think it\u2019s got a lot of potential. CBD is one of the non-psychoactive components in cannabis. Although that said I would say that there is a lot of science as well as general belief that CBD as an organic compound has many positive and curative in fact health benefits I think you maybe aware that FDA just recently approved the first CBD drug in the United States to treat childhood epilepsy or seizure disorder. And then CBD has other qualities potentially that people are seeking organic, inorganic products, so the market could be very big. As we have said it\u2019s not a psychoactive component, but it has properties that I think the consumer would be interested in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everybody, I just had one question, I think in the prepared remarks Rob you talked a little bit about part of the motivation to ship ahead in this quarter and wine and spirits was to get ahead of maybe some potential freight shortages, so could you just add a little bit of color to that, is that sort of freight coming out of California. And also just as we are looking forward is that a potential sort of variable or factor that we have to think about over the next couple of quarters? Rob Sands : Sure. So little is a good word and that we always have shipped more during the first half then we deplete as we always want to build inventory prior to the OND holiday season October, November and December. I would say little is a good word because we probably should a little more than normal versus depletions and that there is some tightness in terms of shipping. But that said I think to directly answer your question I don\u2019t think that we see that as you know any kind of material problematic matter for really wine, beer or spirits. It\u2019s just something that we have to keep in mind and we have to take into account so that our products are well positioned in the marketplace. I know David has talked a little bit about higher shipping costs as it relates to beer, but these are things that we have otherwise offset to the creation of other operational efficiencies and its not huge dollars for us. So the fundamental answer especially on wine and spirit side is no, we don\u2019t see it, there is really nothing like totally something to be concerned about, it\u2019s really sort of just more a minor business matter we are shipping lanes, it is tough to get shipping lanes. But that said we expect to \u2013 we have got everything well under \u2013 well in hand and we don\u2019t expect it to be particularly impactful on the wine business and on the beer business as David has said we would largely offset any cost increases there that we have seen. So we are in pretty good shape on shipping and shipping costs and availability throughout the whole business in the remainder of the year. Bryan Spillane : Alright. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a terrific quarter. You have over the various quarters done a nice job keeping expectations down on beer margins on the one hand, on the other hand you highlight record margins this quarter and we understand I think that the timing on the marketing side, but even in regardless of that you had a very nice progression on the gross margin, also in your opening comments, there was talk about further runway for margin expansion in the beer business. So, I'm just wondering if you could give us your latest assessment of the medium-term outlook on margins for the beer business, please? Rob Sands : Yes. I\u2019ll let David address that, but I\u2019ll just say that our expectations are in that 39% to 40% range sort of as simple as that. You already cited some of the factors that have contributed to the slightly outside margins in the second quarter, but we\u2019re expecting margins to be relatively flat for the whole year. There are some headwinds which we talked about, we\u2019ve offset those headwinds. So, I think that we\u2019re going to maintain approximately the same margins. David? David Klein : Yes. So, Robert, first of all, I think I\u2019ve said this to you before, but the \u2013 we being our team comes in everyday trying to make our margins as high as we possibly can. So, when we talk about holding the line on margins, it's we are trying to expand them as much as we can. But I would say this is playing out kind of the way we had anticipated over the last few years as there was a lot of I'd say exuberance around where our margins could get to and we had a view that we had existed in a benign commodity pricing environment for a long period of time in a pretty favorable peso environment for us for a long period of time and that we know we have a lot of potential things that we can do from an operation standpoint to continue to enhance our margins and maybe even possibly from a pricing standpoint to enhance our margins over time. But we just want to be prudent about where that can get us to because we know we have these headwinds and it seems unrealistic to just talk about the positives without being really clear about what the potential drags could be in. I would say that this year is kind of playing out that way. We\u2019re seeing some really good things happening from an operations perspective that are helping to be a bit of a driver for improved margins, but we\u2019re also seeing drags on margin like the freight topic that we and everyone else is talking about at this point. Robert Ottenstein : Will your distributor consolidation presumably that can help on the margin side? David Klein : We are not expecting that we get margin enhancement from that sort of activity. Again, we \u2013 everything we do is built around driving growth in our business. Again, we\u2019d be really happy to have a business that for the next several years grew at this rate at 40% margins. Rob Sands : I would say however that to the extent that our distributor consolidations create efficiencies and therefore improve distributor margin on our business that creates an environment where the distributors are more willing to invest behind our brands than the opposite. So that is part of the thinking behind this and then the distributors\u2019 actual investment behind our brands should drive continued strong results if not better results for our business, which will translate back to us on even better sales and growth than otherwise would be the case everything remaining equal. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open. Rob Sands : Hi, Brett. David Klein : Hi. Brett Cooper : Hi. Two questions if I can slip them in. First off just wondering if you could offer your views on what you're seeing in terms of fall shelf resets and what you'd expect from Spring I guess specifically looking at beer? And then on the cannabis front, when you're talking to regulatory authorities, do you guys have a particular view in which you are trying to get to in terms of what the retail format and distribution format looks like in the future? Thanks. Rob Sands : On the first question as I said historically a lot, we retailers should be giving Constellation and our beer business more space in general because we\u2019re their largest growth provider and probably their most profitable supplier. And I think that, that is resonating and therefore we do continue to make distribution gains and therefore acquire more space for our portfolio, which as I said is the number one growth portfolio and profit provider to many retailers. So, I think that that\u2019s all going well and that\u2019s part of what we call our shoppers\u2019 first programs, probably historically referred to as category management, but now shoppers first is what we call it. And then on your second question, the answer to that \u2013 I think you sort of phrased it in terms of talking to regulatory bodies and this and that. In the United States, it\u2019s really more about talking to politicians. We have got to get over the hump of decriminalization first. And then in the states that are legal, we are really not talking to anybody, because we are not participating in that because of the federal illegality. In Canada, we are definitely talking to regulatory bodies and the government about how the product is going to be sold and through what channels. I mean, Ontario is probably a good example of that, where initially it was planned to go through the LCBA, the Ontario Liquor Control Boards. And then very recently, the Ontario government changed direction and decided to allow it to be sold through private retailers. As you may know or may not know, Canopy bought a company of private retailers called Haiku and their brand for their stores is called Tokyo Smoke. And that\u2019s one of the formats that we are developing our stores in, but one of the things that Canopy has done and I think with a lot of forethought is already gone out and secured prime retail locations even in Ontario to put our Tokyo Smoke branded stores and Tweed branded stores in anticipation of being able to have private stores and outlets in Ontario and of course in the other provinces. Originally, Haiku and Tokyo Smoke had stores in British Columbia and is developing stores in British Columbia. So, we are well-positioned from a branding point of view to control, so to speak, the whole ecosystem around the brands that we are developing in particular in Canada and the vertical integration, which will be very profitable as well in Canada. Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Sands for closing remarks. Rob Sands : Well, thank you everyone. And let me say, as we close out the discussion of our quarterly results, I would like to reiterate the confidence that we have in our ability to drive the future growth of our business while generating very strong cash flows that allow us the flexibility to make strategic investments in long-term growth opportunities with significant upside. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January, so please be sure to have a safe and happy holiday season and remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations with friends and family. So, thank you again for joining our call and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn Urlaub : Thanks, Brian. Good morning and welcome to Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our CEO, Bill Newlands, our President and COO and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements that we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob. Rob Sands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and got the chance to enjoy some of our fine products during the holiday season. As I reflect on 2018, I'm reminded that I'm very fortunate to be part of the exciting dynamic at ever-changing beverage alcohol industry. I'm also proud of the fact that Constellation continues to be one of the best growth stories in the industry, led by our remarkable high-end beer business, which is generating double-digit top and bottom line growth. Overall, our business is strong and has excellent prospects for the future and for future growth. And that's why I believe it's the right time to hand over my CEO responsibilities to Bill Newlands, while I assume the role of Executive Chair at the beginning of our next fiscal year on March 1. Bill has an excellent understanding and appreciation for the values and strategy that have made Constellation Brands one of the top-performing S&P 500 companies over the last decade. Since joining Constellation in 2015, Bill has made a significant impact on our company, as he's assumed increasing levels of responsibility finding ways to leverage our unique capabilities as a leader in total beverage alcohol and reinvigorating our innovation engine. The company is in good hands with Bill at the helm, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate on key strategic initiatives as I transition to my position as Executive Chair. As such, Bill will be taking the lead with David and the IR team on all future investment calls \u2013 investor calls and meetings. Over the years, I've valued and appreciated the ideas, suggestions, and feedbacks I've received from the investment community, and I'd like to thank you for your ongoing support. I'd like to mention that my brother Richard and I recently acquired in excess of 1 million shares, to take advantage of the tremendous value that Constellation's stock currently represents. With that said and as a precursor to my transition to Executive Chair, I believe it's the appropriate time to turn the call over to Bill, who will review our business results for the quarter. Bill? Bill Newlands : Thank you, Rob. I'm honored to be selected as Constellation's next CEO and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to lead one of the best growth stories in the CPG category. As many of you are aware, in Rob's tenure as CEO, Constellation has delivered an incredible total shareholder return of almost 800%. Rob, that's quite a legacy and certainly a tough act to follow, so congratulations to you. Let's now turn to the business. I have five key takeaways that I would like to emphasize on this morning's call. Number one, Constellation's beer business continues to outperform the U.S. beer market by a wide double-digit margin. Number two; we have plenty of beer capacity in Mexico to meet the incredible demand for our products well into the future. Number three; we're disappointed with the performance of our wine and spirits business, as we're facing challenges with the low end of the portfolio. As a result, we've changed our guidance for the year and have taken action by pursuing strategic alternatives to optimize the value of that business. I personally have assumed short-term responsibility for the business to accelerate this effort, and we expect to have more say in the coming months as a final outcome is determined Number four, Canopy Growth is committed to achieving their CAD 1 billion revenue run rate target within the next 18 months. And number five, we plan to provide $4.5 billion in cash returns to shareholders within the next three years in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So let's take a moment to discuss each of these points in the order that I outlined them starting with beer. High-end beer is driving virtually all the U.S. beer category growth and Constellation as the leader in the high-end beer is driving a significant portion of that growth. As a matter of fact, in the month of December, which is the largest month of our fourth quarter, beer depletions accelerated to a rate that was ahead of our fiscal year-to-date growth rate of 9%. Our beer business marked the highlight of our third quarter driven by Corona and Modelo brand families, which continued to be fueled by strong velocities, excellent distribution gains, and highly incremental innovation. Corona Premier, Corona Familiar, and Modelo Especial achieved winning spots as the top three high-end U.S. beer industry share gainers for the quarter, while Constellation's overall beer business was the most significant share gainer in the U.S. beer market during this time frame. Modelo Especial continues to have incredible momentum as the number one growth driver in U.S. beer and it is now the number one beer overall in the state of California. Strong NFL media support during the quarter for this brand provided the reach to expand market share with general market consumers while maintaining its leading position with the growing Hispanic consumer base. The Corona brand families\u2019 depletion growth has roughly doubled to 8% this fiscal year fueled by better than expected performance from our fiscal year 2019 innovation initiatives, Corona Premier and Familiar. And we continue to see growing household penetration with Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers for our Corona brands. I'm extremely pleased with Premiers' best-in-class incrementality which is driving value for distributors and retailers as a trade-up option for consumers in the growing better for you space. Corona Premier has already become one of the top growth contributors in the high-end and we believe Premier continues to have ample runway for growth, as its sourcing much of its volume from the more than 1 billion cases of declining domestic lights. Corona Extra continues to provide the strong foundation needed for the portfolio to grow with strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54. There also continues to be plenty of runway for future Corona Extra growth with incremental contributions from draft and canned format as well as the Coronita product. We also have a very strong beer innovation pipeline now and for the future with ample opportunities to increase distribution and space across our portfolio. Corona Refresca is one of these opportunities and based on our consumer research is more than 80% incremental to our growth. It's our strategy to complement our import portfolio and lay the foundation for future success with domestic sessionable and alternative beverage alcohol products that appeal to general market and Hispanic consumers. Now turning to the operations side of our business. We are currently putting the finishing touches on the final Nava capacity expansion, which we expect to be complete by this fiscal year-end. This marks an incredible feat of expanding capacity to 30 million hectoliters over the last five years, on time and on budget, while providing ample supply to meet the growth demand for our beer portfolio. We also continued the new expansion phase at our Obregon brewery with design, site work and utility installations in various phases of completion. Based on our progress to date, we now believe the new five million hectoliter expansion at Obregon will be completed ahead of schedule by the end of fiscal 2021, which is about one year ahead of the original time line for this project. Construction also continues at Mexicali with brew house tanks in place and warehouse and packaging buildings near completion. While the political environment in Mexicali has been challenging, Constellation has adhered to all regulatory obligations in accordance with Mexican law, which has been verified by the Secretary of the Interior in Mexico. In any event, upon completion of our planned five million hectoliter expansion project, Mexicali will only represent 10% of Constellation's total beer capacity in Mexico. The capacity we have built in Nava plus Obregon when completed will provide more than 400 million cases of beer, which is ample supply for several years to come. Shifting now to wine and spirits. We are currently taking advantage of the premiumization trends that have accelerated in the U.S. wine market with virtually all the growth being driven at the greater than $11 retail price point and that's where we're focused. In the last 52 weeks, we outperformed the U.S. wine market at the greater than $11 level with several of our focused brands growing double digits in IRI channels during this time frame. We believe we have unique and ownable positions with powerhouse brands like the Prisoner, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Robert Mondavi, and Schrader to name just a few. Not only do we have powerful brands at these price points, but our innovation engine is focused on premiumizing the portfolio with mix and margin-accretive brands. Our innovation efforts are paying off with successes like Meiomi Ros\u00e9, SVEDKA Blue Raspberry, and Cooper & Thief Rye Barrel Aged Cabernet, all of which are exceeding our expectations. Another great example of innovation success and a turnaround story as well is Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is currently the second-most significant growth contributor to the Cabernet Sauvignon category driven by the Robert Mondavi Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, a brand that equally has exceeded our expectations. My goal for the wine and spirits business is really quite simple. It's to drive a powerful portfolio of high-end wine brands that consistently deliver growth, exceeding the trends in the U.S. market, with an operating margin profile in the 30% range. Now, turning to our leading position in the cannabis market through our investment in Canopy Growth. We are seeing strong consumer demand in the Canadian recreational cannabis market. According to the Canadian government, as of the third quarter of calendar 2018, Canadians spent at a run rate of almost $6 billion on cannabis products, the majority of which were purchased illegally for non-medical use. As we've discussed, we believe the emerging cannabis space represents one of the most significant global growth opportunities of the next decade and frankly, our life time, an opportunity that is opening up much more rapidly than originally anticipated. And on that point, the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill was recently passed with one of the key components of the legislation legalizing production of industrial hemp, including CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound that is believed to have significant medical benefits. It also emends the U.S. Controlled Substances Act by removing hemp-derived CBD products from schedule one and allow states to regulate the production and sale of hemp. Canopy Growth provides a single platform for Constellation to address all global markets and product formats including both CBD and THC. They announced in a press release earlier this week their position and advantages relating to the U.S. market entry for CBD products and they are currently awaiting FDA guidelines pertaining to the sale of these products in the United States. Since our investment in August, Canopy has used the proceeds to bolster their global leadership position in the cannabis industry with strategic partnerships and acquisitions including Ebbu, a leading hemp research and innovation firm; Storz & Bickel, a profitable global leader in vaporizer, design and manufacturing; and Battelle who is the world's largest non-profit R&D organization. Canopy and Battelle will work together to advance cannabis medical research and product development. In addition Canopy continues to focus on intellectual property development across medical and recreational opportunities, while also preparing and creating brands and products for new legal recreational cannabis markets across various product formats that will be sold through new and existing channels. It is these initiatives that give me confidence that Canopy can and will achieve their CAD1 billion revenue run rate target within the next 18 months. In closing, as the growth leader in the total U.S. beverage alcohol space, Constellation has a stable, core consumer franchise market with growth prospects that exceed those of our competitors in this sector. And our investment in Canopy Growth provides an even greater long-duration growth play which we believe is being valued as our free call option today with significant value in the future. Combine this with our powerful cash generation capability and our desire to quickly delever and return $4.5 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, those in combination make Constellation a compelling investment for the future. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for this quarter. David Klein : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone With a lot of volatility in the equity markets and knowing that our investors must continue to assess where they can get the best returns, I want to offer you why we believe that Constellation provides the best combination of growth and cash returns to shareholders within the CPG space. We've grown comparable basis diluted EPS at almost a 20% CAGR over the past three years using the midpoint of our updated FY 2019 guidance. We remain committed to our algorithm of a 10% comparable basis EPS growth CAGR on a mid to high single-digit net sales growth CAGR over the medium term. This may not be straight line performance, given changing consumer preferences and economic volatility, but we're confident we'll deliver on this commitment. In addition to our growth prospects, we believe Constellation is also a cash return story. We plan to return approximately $45 billion to our investors over the next three fiscal years in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This goal is supported by our historically strong cash flow generation and the ramping down of the CapEx needs in our beer business. It assumes we quickly delever back into and operate within our 3.5 times targeted leverage ratio range, as we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. It also assumes we exercise the Canopy warrants that expire in November of 2021. Our Canopy investment is like a ventures investment, which positions us to use our capabilities in building brands in a regulated industry to take advantage of the legitimization of an emerging $200 billion global industry. The impact of Canopy on our income statement will be reflected as non-cash equity and earnings from an unconsolidated investment. This will not limit our ability to return cash to our shareholders. In terms of noncash performance to date, we we've recognized $12 billion of unrealized net gains on our investments through the end of Q3. As Bill said, we fully expect Canopy to achieve a CAD 1 billion net sales run rate within 18 months and we continue to expect to receive outsized returns on our total investment in Canopy. Now let's look at our Q3 performance where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Q3 represents another quarter of strong execution by our beer business, which generated double-digit net sales and operating income growth. These strong results coupled with tax favorability helped us to deliver 18% comparable basis diluted EPS growth for the quarter. For beer, we continue to outpace the rest of the beer category by a consistently wide double-digit margin. Net sales increased 16% on volume growth of 14%. In addition to strong demand, shipment volume also benefited from timing as fiscal year-to-date shipment and depletion volume are now fairly aligned. Year-to-date depletions grew 9%. Beer operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 37.3%. This reflects higher marketing as a percent of net sales which increased 70 basis points to almost 11%. Favorability in pricing, FX and SG& A were offset by higher COGS, primarily related to increased transportation. In addition, we experienced higher glass cost in the quarter due to a non-recurring raw material supply issue that impacted glass production at the Nava glass plant. This supply issue has been rectified. Gross margin for the quarter would have been flat when excluding this impact Depreciation expense increased $10 million to $52 million for Q3 and $30 million to $152 million for the fiscal year-to-date period. For wine and spirits shipment volumes and net sales were flat. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 27% as SG&A favorability and pricing benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix. Our comparable basis interest expense increased 14% for the quarter and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved up to 4.6 times at the end of November from 3.6 times at the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the additional Canopy investment financing. Our cash generation profile is strong, as we expect our business to produce over $2 billion of operating cash flow annually. This positions us to quickly delever back into our targeted leverage range and return cash to our shareholders as I outlined earlier. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 14.1% versus 19% last year. The decrease primarily reflects benefits from Tax Reform and increased stock-based compensation benefits. This rate came in lower than our previous guidance due to higher than forecasted stock-based compensation benefits and a lower than expected effective tax rate on our foreign business. Now I'd like to provide an update on fiscal 2019 guidance. For beer, we expect fiscal 2019 net sales growth to be at the high end of the 9% to 11% range including 1% to 2% pricing benefit on our Mexican portfolio. This guidance implies depletion growth above the 9% year-to-date depletion rate. Volume growth will lag depletion growth in Q4 due to timing and a tough compare. We also expect operating margin for beer to approximate 39%. This would represent a 50 basis point decrease versus last year's 39.5% operating margin in our previous guidance which implied a relatively flat operating margin result in fiscal 2019. Forecasted transportation costs are driving gross margins to be fairly flat compared to our previous goal of gross margin improvement for the year, as the benefit from pricing is being largely offset by the higher transportation costs as well as higher depreciation expense. We believe holding gross margin for the year is an impressive result, given the unfavorable gross margin impact we've experienced from transportation cost for the first three quarters of the year. We've been able to accomplish this result in part from the operational costs and efficiency initiatives that we have underway and which we expect to continue into next year. These efforts are important, as we continue to expect some transportation cost headwinds as we move into fiscal 2020, as drivers in freight lanes are expected to remain in short supply. We expect fiscal 2019 marketing as a percent of net sales to be at the low end of our targeted range of 9.5% to 10%. This compares to last year's 9% result. This year's incremental marketing investments are primarily in support of our very successful Corona Premier and Corona Familiar product introductions along with Modelo Especial, which along with Modelo Especial were top share gainers this quarter. Going forward, we expect our marketing as a percent of net sales to fluctuate within the 9% to 10% range and may move toward the higher end of that range depending on the magnitude of our innovation. Moving to wine and spirits. Year-to-date, U.S. shipment volume has outpaced depletion volume primarily due to timing. This timing benefit is expected to reverse in Q4, as a result we now expect fiscal 2019 wine and spirits net sales and operating income to decrease low single digits compared to our previous guidance of 2% to 4% net sales and operating income growth. In addition, we've updated our interest expense projection to a range of $380 million to $390 million. This now includes $55 million in additional interest expense related to the financing of our $4 billion, Canopy Growth investment. This has an approximate $0.25 impact on our fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS. We continue to expect our fiscal 2019 comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 18%, which implies a Q4 rate of approximately 19%. This higher Q4 rate is primarily due to lower-than-expected benefits from stock-based compensation. Finally, I'd like to note for fiscal 2019, we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 196 million shares, corporate segment expense as a percentage of net sales to approximate 2.5% and net income attributable to non-controlling interest to approximately $20 million to $25 million. Due to the factors I just outlined, we now expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30 per share. Excluding the impact of the incremental Canopy related interest expense, comparable basis diluted EPS for our core business will grow almost 10% for fiscal 2019. We remain on track to generate over $2.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. And now a few additional words about our Canopy investment. We will be accounting for our November 2017 initial common share investment and the additional common share investment, which closed on November 1st of 2018 under the equity method of accounting. As of November 1st, our Canopy ownership totaled 123 million shares. This represented approximately 37% of the outstanding common shares of Canopy Growth. This portion of our Canopy investment will not change in subsequent periods due to the fluctuation in Canopy's stock price. Instead we'll see fluctuation based upon our share of Canopy earnings. The equity and earnings for our share of Canopy earnings will be reported on a two-month lag. Therefore, Canopy's earnings for November and December, which is included in their Q3 results will be recognized in Constellation's Q4 results. Our Canopy warrants are recorded at fair value. Market fluctuations will, therefore, flow through our reported earnings. We'll continue to exclude changes in the fair value of these warrants from our comparable basis earnings. I'd like to emphasize that the recognition of our share of Canopy earnings in our income statement will not impact Constellation's cash flow. To reiterate, Canopy's equity and earnings are a noncash flow item for Constellation. We continue to evaluate the potential equity and earnings impact to fiscal 2019 in fiscal 2020 results from the Canopy investment. Including any potential comparable adjustments related to the transaction. As a result, Canopy's equity and earnings impact is not factored into our updated fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS guidance range of $920 to $930. When we begin recognizing our share of Canopy earnings, we will adjust Canopy's reported IFRS results to U.S. GAAP. As such, the fair value accounting impacts related to Canopy's biological assets and inventory will not be reflected in our GAAP or comparable basis results. However, our GAAP and comparable basis results will reflect amortization expense related to the fair value allocated to Canopy's intangible assets. In addition I would also note, we currently expect stock-based expense related to Canopy's acquisition milestone payments, as well as other certain fair value changes to be excluded from our comparable basis results. When we provide guidance for fiscal 2020 in early April, we'll continue to provide net sales and operating income growth targets for our beer and wine and spirits businesses in order to highlight the underlying earnings power of our core business. Separately, we expect to provide guidance related to Canopy's non-cash equity and earnings and the estimated interest expense associated with the Canopy investment and how these items will impact Constellation's P&L. This approach will highlight the strong financial growth and cash generation capability of our core business, which we believe is not currently reflected in our valuation. With that, we're now happy to take your questions Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Rob Sands : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. So my question is around the trajectory of beer depletions going forward. Fiscal Q3 was a bit softer than we've seen from you guys historically at 8%, but it sounds like you're off to good start so far in fiscal Q4. So help me understand that slowdown in Q3? Was it more just industry softness is dissipating a bit now? And just any thoughts around if your forward beer depletion growth can hold up if the industry trends remain softer would help? And then specifically on the innovation front going forward, can you give us some detail on if you think Premier can grow next year, year two post the launch? And the reasons why? And just any frame of reference for how big you think Refresca can be next year? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Dara, a couple of things on the depletion trends. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, our depletion trends in December were actually up higher than our year-to-date rate which was at 9%. So we're still very comfortable with the growth profile of our business. What's also important to note is that our share gaining performance during that quarter remained consistent with our share gaining performance over the course of the year. So our delta to the market remained very, very strong and we're confident that this is going to be a continuing trend. Relative to innovation, we think there's a lot of runway yet to go in Premier. We continued to see accelerating velocities in that business, and we expect that that's going to be an important part of our overall mix for our Corona brand family going forward. Lastly, Refresca, well it's a little early to tell. We're extremely excited about this. Our research and our testing that we've done on Refresca suggests this will be over 80% incremental to our core franchise and will bring new customers into our business. So we think this is going to be a tremendous launch that will occur during the early part of our next fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. A \u2013 Rob Sands : Hi, Bonnie. Q \u2013 Bonnie Herzog : Hi. I had a question on beer gross margins. I guess, I'm still trying to reconcile like you guys said during your last quarterly call in terms of cost and things being more transitory, especially transportation. And then you also talked about several COGS improvement initiatives that were underway to help offset some of the cost headwinds. So could you give us an update on those initiatives? Did something change with timing since they didn't really help to offset some of the gross margin headwinds that you faced in the quarter? And I guess, I'm still trying to reconcile maybe what went wrong in the quarter? And then how we should think about gross margins for the full year? You did mention they\u2019d be flat instead of improving, but just want to make sure they're not worse than flat. Thank you. A \u2013 David Klein : Yes. No we're still comfortable with flat, Bonnie. And if we kind of breakdown the gross \u2013 the Q3 gross margin, the transportation and logistics headwind accelerated a little bit for us in Q3, but we still, because of the productivity initiatives, we still were well on track to at least maintain our margins in the quarter. And then we had an issue with some raw material inputs into our glass facility in Nava, which caused us to have to slow down the furnaces and lower throughput for the plant in Q3. That's a one-time issue. But it created a headwind that the other \u2013 that in addition to the freight headwinds, we weren't able to overcome. But other \u2013 again other than a slight acceleration in our transportation and logistics cost headwind and the glass issue, we remain \u2013 we remain on track with where we thought we would be with gross margins. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the \u2013 I guess the question is on the wine business and you're talking about some of the strategic alternatives. I know it's probably too early for you to give us some finite viewpoints, but maybe help us understand some of the options you might have available to you? I think there were some discussions in prior meetings about perhaps regionalizing some brands or even making some of the brands private label at certain retailers, maybe you could just help us understand kind of how we should think about it? A \u2013 Bill Newlands : Sure. I think, Nik, the way we're thinking about the wine business is this. We have an entire stable of brands that generate outstanding gross margins and have high growth profiles at the high-end of our business. You've heard me say before something like Kim Crawford has a 68% gross margin. It's a terrific business, as is Meiomi and many of our other brands and the Prisoner and things of that nature. We have been challenged by the lower end of our business, which in totality has been flat to down and we continue to be slightly over-weighted into that sector of the business. So we \u2013 as we've said before are taking a strategic look at what our portfolio should look like going forward, which could include disposition of some of the lower end of our portfolio. Our long-term view is that the high-end of the business, which is the \u2013 in our judgment, primarily are driven by over $11 price point is where we're going to get the kind of margin structure and growth profile that we think we would like to see for our wine business going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks. So, I really want to just pick on the $4.5 billion in cash return and just some clarifications around that. Is that \u2013 I'm assuming that's a fiscal 2020 to 2022 statement just want to get that out of there? And then any color you could provide on the cadence of that cash return? And as you think about the cash return alongside maintaining the targeted leverage ratio, I know you said you want to delever to 3.5 times then exercise the warrants, which presumably puts you back above 3.5. So as we think about the capital structure over that \u2013 alongside that $4.5 billion in cash return at the end of it, are you anticipating it to be at 3.5 times? Or be above that as you think about the next three years? Thanks. David Klein : So, Steve when we think about that \u2013 first of all this isn't necessarily new news in that, our company generates a lot of cash and we know that we're going to have CapEx ramping down over the next few years, the CapEx related to our beer business. And so we look at \u2013 we have a targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 times, although we're willing to operate in that three to four times range. And we're really confident that we'll be able to both, return $4.5 billion worth of cash, stay within our targeted leverage ratio range and exercise the Canopy warrants. And I think that's a pretty powerful view of the ability of our business to generate cash. And we don't expect that there would be any share repurchases in the remainder of FY 2019 just given where our leverage ratio is. So clearly your point about it being an FY 2020 through FY 2022 statement is accurate. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open. Vivien Azer : Thank you. Good morning. David Klein : Hi, Viv. Rob Sands : Hi, Vivien. Vivien Azer : I wanted to touch on wine as well, a two-part question for you. Number one, could you \u2013 can you comment anything specific that drove the magnitude of the deterioration over the last three months in the low end, Bill, I heard you loud and clear that the low end has been a problem, but given the magnitude of the guide down it seems like something changed and changed pretty recently. And then the follow-up to that is, how do you think about the impact of potential asset sales in wine, impacting your ability to be a category captain or category leader in that category? So I think historically one of the cases for having a broad wine portfolio was that scale gave you a lot of influence at retail? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Well, certainly the growth profile of the wine business, I think is going to continue to be in that $11. Now we've seen premiumization be an ongoing play for years and years and years and I don't see that changing any. Therefore, I wouldn't see that there would be a lot of difference in the whole question of being able for category captaincy. People look for organizations that have growth profiles and for people that have deep consumer understanding of where the market's going and why. Relative to the decline in our low-end business which is reflective in the earnings position. We've certainly seen that and we said this last quarter, our shipments have been ahead of our depletions, partially driven by our desire to make sure we had adequate inventory levels heading into the holiday season. And frankly that needs to correct in Q4. The low end of the business, which we've said, we are looking at strategic alternatives has suffered the most and that's not surprising when you make a statement of that ilk. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. I think you've been pretty clear on the Canopy impact on the P&L and delineating cash versus non-cash impacts to net income. But I do think that there's a lot of concern out there around the degree to which you will see dilution to your earnings base in fiscal 2020 and beyond from Canopy. So you've talked about the CAD 1 billion in revenue. Anything that you can add in terms of the current outlook for Canopy's earnings? My understanding from them is that they intend to report Canada separately. So even if they reinvest profit dollars to establish U.S., so whatever it may be, that we'll see they're executing in Canada. But anything you can offer, I think, would be really helpful, because people are struggling with the 20 kind of number that we should be benign with here. Thanks. David Klein : Yes. So Lauren, so we expect and we've said this, this isn't Canopy, now this is really Constellation's view. We expect the Canadian business to be at that CAD 1 billion run rate. We expect them to have very attractive CPG-like operating margins within their business and that's focused on Canada. And we also know, as you pointed out, that there will be drags on their business from investment in R&D and the cost of opening additional markets. So we've said that, we expect that this transaction will be accretive to us by FY 2021 and we expect that to be the case, or we continue to expect that to be the case. In terms of actual guidance in the near term for Canopy, we're not in a position to provide that, primarily because they've just closed their recent quarter. They'll produce results in mid-February. And shortly after that mid-February results come out from Canopy, we'll then provide a bit of a walk through for the market on how those actual results will flow through our P&L, and that'll be the first time we do it. And then clearly, when we provide guidance we'll provide more specificity around the Canopy equity and earnings number. And I know you said, we've been clear on this, but it's a non-cash measure. We're viewing this as a ventures investment. We've already made that investment. That was the $4 billion investment that we closed in November. And we expect to get an outsized return on that investment, understanding there's going to be some volatility in our P&L, however that volatility will be non-cash in nature. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Bill, a quick clarification on wine and then the beer business. So you said, over shipment will clear in fourth quarter. Should we expect that impact to drag into fiscal 2020? Or by the end of 4Q, you would have achieved right inventory level for wine? And I have a beer business question. A \u2013 Bill Newlands : Sure. No, we expect \u2013 the way we have traditionally run is no matter what our situation is coming into the fourth quarter, we get our depletions and our shipments to balance during the course of the fourth quarter. So we would not expect that this would have impact on next fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So in terms of the capital allocation for the strategic alternatives for the wine brands, would an outright sale be doable in that view? And if so, what is the part of use of cash, as you said before in the prepared remarks but could you please rank if that would be pay down the debt first buybacks and leaving the warrants for Canopy for after when you see your own cash flow generation? A \u2013 David Klein : Yes. So in terms of any proceeds of any asset dispositions that may come up over a period time, we would first make sure that we're comfortably within our targeted leverage ratio range. And then beyond that, as we've committed today, we'd be focused on returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to the Canopy warrants, and I want to be really clear about this, we're going to return $4.5 billion to our investors and we can fund the Canopy warrants. However, we'll only fund the Canopy warrants, if it make sense and the business is unfolding as we expect when we get into November of 2021. So if that business is going well, we think our investors will be happy for us to exercise those warrants. And if the business isn't going well, we'll have a lot more cash to return to our investors. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning. So I guess my question is around the Corona brand family performance. And recognizing that obviously this year, you had a very good performance on Premier and Familiar. Bill, I'm just wondering what do you think is going on with the Extra in terms of velocity being down this year? And then as you think about next year, do you think that the broader Corona franchise can continue to grow at this 7%, 8% even if Corona Extra is down a bit next year? A \u2013 Bill Newlands : Yes. One of the things that you see going on with Corona Extra is good news \u2013 what I would call a good news, bad news situation. Premier has done so well. And even though the incrementality is over 70%, which is phenomenal, the better it does, the more it has some impact on our other franchises from which it does take some cannibalization. So \u2013 and obviously, as you can have all seen, Corona Premier has virtually done twice what we expected it to do heading into this fiscal year. So it's been a phenomenal success. What I do believe is that the Corona franchise continues to have significant upside across the entire brand family. And my \u2013 just as a marketing belief, I think that the more Corona brand family we can provide to the consumer and that the consumer buys is outstanding for the long-term equity of the Corona brand family. So we're very optimistic. You then in turn add Corona Refresca, which brings a whole different consumer profile to the table. As I said during my prepared remarks, it appears that that will be in \u2013 at the high end of the incrementality that we saw with Premier, which was best-in-class. So again this will help to enhance the number of times that consumers in this country are picking up a Corona brand family product, and I think that speaks very well to the long-term franchise of Corona. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. So a lot of questions came into us on the gross margin for beer. And you addressed some of it, but I just want to kind of touch on a couple of points. One, shipments really strong, all things equal you would think the shipments would have been a benefit for the gross margin in the quarter. However, there could have been additional transportation costs related to that. Can you address that? Second on the gross margin. Looks like you got around 2% pricing for beer, is that right? And then finally, roughly what quarter do you think the transportation costs will start to ease? Thank you. David Klein : Yeah. So Robert, the pricing \u2013 so if I do a bridge out of our gross margin numbers, we got about 110 basis point benefit from pricing. We got a little bit of a benefit from FX. We had about 160 basis point drag from transportation and logistics, which is larger than it's been on a year-to-date basis. That's the acceleration that we were talking about. And then as I said we had some drag from the glass issue, which was in aggregate \u2013 that and maybe some depreciation amounted to about 80 basis points. So a couple of things happened when we get into Q3 and that's that even though we're shipping more we're actually \u2013 we are slowing down our production because it's our lowest, kind of, production quarter of the year. And so I think taken altogether, the gross margin worked out as we expected, but for the glass plant \u2013 the glass production issue, which is behind us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to Canopy and just given the importance here in the focus among the investment community. Can you drill down a little bit on the Canada rec rollout, I think you said strong demand I'm not sure if there's anything you can add to that, relative market share 30% to 40%? Another question, beverage rollout expectations, I think your discussion has been around calendar Q4. Maybe if you can frame the opportunity and what you're expecting there? And then just last in the long-term guidance, what gives you confidence at this point on the 1 billion within 18 months? And then David maybe you could just confirm the 30% to 40% operating margins as well for Canopy. I think you said CPG-like margins. Just want to confirm that you're still confident that 30% to 40% is operating margin is the right number? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. Why don't I take the first piece of that and I think David will take the last piece of that. Let me just remind everyone upfront that we are in a quite period, they are in a quite period at this point in time. So we will be reflecting things that have been in the public domain. Yes, Canopy has been progressing with the kind of market share, which we have said before is in the 30-plus-percent range of the total cannabis business in Canada. We also if you'll recall projected that the Canadian market as part of our total global projections of where we thought the market would go would be in the $5 billion to $7 billion range. And just this past week the Canadian government has estimated that the consumption of cannabis by Canadians in the third quarter was at a run rate of $5.9 billion, which of course is right smack in the middle of what the initial projections were. I'll remind everyone, beverages are not currently available in Canada. We expect and Canopy expects that that will change later this calendar year. But an exact date of that has not been defined yet. But I can assure you when and if that eventuality occurs and we certainly expect that it will. The Canopy will be in a position to take advantage of that opportunity. David Klein : And the only thing I might add to that, Bill, is the $59 billion number quoted by the Canadian government includes -- majority of that is illegal sales. So really the build to $1 billion is dependent upon the channel shift, if you will, from illegal markets to legal markets, of which we're comfortable with the market share that we've outlined before for Canopy. And I would say that after Canopy's results are released in mid-February, they will have a lot more to say about their margins as will we. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is now open. Pablo Zuanic : Thank you and congratulations, Bill, on your appointment. Just a quick question. I want to go back to what Judy was discussing. I'm trying to understand better the cannibalization or the opportunity for Premier and Familiar in terms of further distribution gains. The numbers we are looking at Corona Extra, a core brand, is down about 10%; Corona Light down about 20%; Modelo Especial, which I think has been cannibalized from Familiar, has decelerated from the 19% range to 10%, 11%. So there is an impact. And according to our data, 80% of your growth in the fourth quarter November was really Premier and Familiar. Yes, the two brands have done great. So the simple question is, as you rolled out those brands, did you have to take space, existing space from your current portfolio? Or did you gain new space? Or are you in the process of converting that and expanding space? What are the opportunities for Premier and Familiar or even Refresca eventually, if it does well in on-premise restaurants in draft? If you can expand on that, because I think there's a question mark here. Depletions up 10% the last two years, this year running 9%, what happens next year when you're so dependent on these line extensions? And I want to speak to one question, but if you can just at the very end, as you have more extensions and you add more complexity to your portfolio, does that in any way affect your profit margins in beer? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. So let me answer the last one first. Any of the products that we have discussed, meaning Familiar and Premier and so forth, we're agnostic as to which product actually gets sold. The margin and profit profile of those individual products are virtually the same. Relative, so let's go back for just a minute to the question of cannibalization. We have seen the cannibalization exactly as we expected. In fact, if anything, it's been slightly less, meaning, more incremental than we had expected with Premier and Familiar. One of the things that we have done extensively and we are continuing to do and I think your point's a good one, is we have had the Shopper First initiative, where our emphasis has been, based on in-store research, as to what an appropriate shelf should look like that focuses on the right set of brands for retailers to maximize their benefit in the beer section. Of course, the beauty of that is, we actually come out pretty well on that issue. And that opens up significant opportunities for us to expand distribution and shelf space. And frankly, we need that shelf space, because our portfolio with its share-gaining performance really demands that kind of shelf placement improvement. I would also mention that Refresca, which you asked a question about, we'll probably not be sitting in the middle of the beer section. This is an alternative beverage alcohol product that will placed \u2013 be placed in the different door of the cold box. And will compete with other brands, not necessarily directly within our franchise and we think this is great, because it opens up another window coming from the great equity that Corona has and has had for many years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Tim Ramey : Thanks so much. Understand your commentary on the sub-$11 wine business, but is there enough other than Woodbridge in the portfolio that would really make a difference there? Is this a Woodbridge problem? Can you speak directly to the performance of Woodbridge? A \u2013 Bill Newlands : Sure. We're actually very happy with Woodbridge. Woodbridge is in a category that's actually in decline but Woodbridge is gaining share within that category. And obviously, it benefits from the Mondavi franchise halo, as you know we have Mondavi\u2019s franchise covered it in a number of price points. And so, Woodbridge will continue to be an important part of our portfolio. And yes, we have a substantial amount of assets in the under $11 price point outside of Woodbridge. And that gives us significant options of what to do going forward and as we said earlier \u2013 in fairly recent time, we\u2019ll be able to talk about that more extensively. A \u2013 David Klein : Then we've also said in the past that, about 30% of our volume comes at the greater than $11 price point. And then if you look at Woodbridge. Woodbridge by itself is about 20% of our volume. And of course, when we're looking the greater than $11 price point, we get a lot more dollars out of that volume. But that gives you a sense for what else is in the portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Kiernan Conway : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Kiernan on for Bill. We just had a question on the spirit side of the wine and spirits business. We have been talking about that much this morning. So hoping to get some comments may be on the SVEDKA national marketing program and any other more kind of commentary on the general portfolio? A \u2013 Bill Newlands : Sure. It's early days on the new creative that we have put out in the marketplace but I can assure you from our initial testing, this is one of the stronger campaigns, certainly that this organization has put out in the recent past. So we're very excited of how that campaign could work for us. And I think it's a great example of some of the work that Jim Sabia has done to bring some of his outstanding marketing efforts in Beer to our wine and spirit efforts as well. So we're very optimistic about it. SVEDKA has already been performing in a positive manner versus the vodka category and we think this can only help it. I'm sure you've also seen, we have very good results as it relates to High West and Casa Noble and continue to see the more premium aspects of our spirits portfolio as important going forward as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for the opportunity. I like to discuss about the Mexicali new water issue. I mean, more and more reports in the Mexican press that there are potentially some risk associated to order rates at the Mexicali brewery, and the impact it has on the local community. So could you please give us some more color about that issue? And let us understand how you are planning to mitigate those risks? Bill Newlands : Sure. As I said in my prepared remarks, our efforts in Mexicali have been totally in compliance with all Mexican law and has been done with a deep understanding of water usage. We do not believe this is a major issue, and we believe that all is going to proceed as planned with our Mexicali site. I will say and I said this also with the completion of our Nava facility as well as our expansion at Obregon that after the five million hectoliters of Mexicali comes online that facility will only represent 10% roughly of our total capacity in Mexico one way or the other. David Klein : Yeah. And said in another way more from an investor's standpoint I would say that we can with Obregon and Nava, Bill said this in his script, we have the ability to produce 400 million cases of beer from Obregon and Nava. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. David, I just wanted to follow-up, you had referenced I think in your prepared remarks just the medium-term growth targets. And \u2013 so just had a couple of follow-ups on that, one is the diluted EPS expectation. The EPS growth of around 10%, does that now include share repurchases given what you've said about capital allocation? And I think the second, you kind of referenced that it's not linear. So I guess as we're kind of looking into fiscal 2020, it's kind of sounded like beer margins may be under pressure for a little while longer, not sure with the past to low \u2013 mid-single-digit growth on operating income in wine and spirits is? So if you kind of meant to refer that next year may \u2013 could potentially be in off algorithm year? Thanks. David Klein : Look, Brian, we haven't even finished rolling up our estimates for next year. What we do know is when you look out over the medium term with our beer business, we still expect that high single-digit net sales growth. We still expect to have very robust margins. And then Bill talked about the wine and spirits view, which is kind of mid-single-digit growth and 30% operating margin. So we think that along with our ability to make investments in the business and buy back our stock as well as getting \u2013 working our way through the early years in the choppiness in the equity and earnings in the Canopy investment, we expect that we'll continue to see that 10% EPS growth target that we put out before. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. So now I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Bill Newlands for any closing comments or remarks. Bill Newlands : Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you a safe and happy and prosperous new year. And as Rob said at the beginning, hopefully you'll do that while enjoying some of our fine products. I'm honored to assume the role of Constellation's CEO in just a few short months, and I look forward to capturing the great opportunities that lie ahead of us for our company. We look forward, David and I to seeing many of you at the CAGNY Conference in late February, where we'll be providing an update on our strategic business initiatives. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call we will provide our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again to everyone for joining the call and have a great day.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s year-end fiscal 2019 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here\u2019s Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal year 2019 year-end call. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen the announcement we made last evening, indicating that we have signed an agreement with Gallo, to sell a portion of our wine and spirit business for $1.7 billion. This strategic action is a result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities to better align our portfolio with consumer trade-up trends and to strengthen the financial profile of this business. Our remaining wine and spirits business will primarily consist of wines at a greater than $11 price point and will include fast-growing, high-margin power brands, like Kim Crawford, the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S.; Meiomi, the number one U.S. Pinot Noir; SVEDKA Vodka, the number one imported vodka in the U.S. Meiomi, I already mentioned, the Prisoner, Robert Mondavi, Ruffino as well as iconic brands like Schrader. With the tighter focus on this powerful collection of consumer-loved brands, we will be able to accelerate growth while increasing brand awareness, consumer demand and household penetration. I\u2019m confident that this optimized portfolio of wine and spirits brands will enable us to consistently deliver growth, exceeding the trends of the U.S. wine market, while migrating to an operating margin profile of 30%, a significant improvement from the 26% margin achieved for this business in fiscal 2019. In a minute, I\u2019ll get into some of the exciting marketing initiatives we have planned for this year, but first, I\u2019d like to highlight that several of these key brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments this past year. We received Impact\u2019s 2018 Hot Brand awards for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Ruffino Prosecco and Robert Mondavi Private Selection. Our portfolio was also called out in the Beverage Information Group\u2019s 2018 awards, where four of our brands achieved Fast Track status, recognizing their impressive growth. Those included Kim, Meiomi and the Prisoner. In addition, 10 of our brands were named Rising Stars and 7 more received Established Growth Brand awards. We also have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year. Some of those keys are new product launches for Woodbridge Ros\u00e9 and Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rye Barrel-Aged Red Blend. We are already having excellent success with some of our recently launched innovations, including SVEDKA Ros\u00e9, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rum Barrel-Aged Merlot, and Crafters Union, Wine in a Can. We will continue to expand our Bourbon Barrel-Aged innovation program, which has been a resounding success, selling over 1 million cases of volume in its first two years. This initiative has reinvigorated Robert Mondavi Private Selection while also becoming the foundation for some of our other innovations like Cooper & Thief. We\u2019re also ramping up our consumer marketing efforts in the coming year. For the first time, we\u2019re taking advantage of new sponsorship opportunities with the PGA, the U.S. Tennis Association and several NFL teams for Meiomi, Kim Crawford and Woodbridge brands, respectively. And our new SVEDKA marketing campaign, Bring Your Own Spirit, has been a resounding success, recently driving double-digit consumer takeaway growth trends in IRI channels. These efforts will help to achieve our goal of accelerating growth for a more premium collection of powerful wine and spirit brands. Now, let\u2019s move on to our beer business. Constellation continues to be the cornerstone of growth in the U.S. beer industry, delivering 36 consecutive quarters of growth, dating back to the beginning of fiscal 2011. High-end beer is driving virtually all the U.S. beer category growth. And our beer business is the leader in high-end beer. For fiscal 2019, Constellation drove 40% of the U.S. high-end category growth and 100% of the import segment growth. We grew share in every U.S. sales region with accelerating trends on the West Coast, where we already have significant market share. There are very few industry segments where this level of growth has been sustained over this length of time. Fiscal 2019 also saw a monumental shift for the Corona brand family as it expanded its offerings from Extra and Light into a more comprehensive beer family with the launches of Premier nationally, Refresca in test markets and the expansion of Familiar. The Corona brand family generated 7% depletion growth for fiscal 2019, selling over 150 million cases, which positions Corona as the number one brand family in the high end. It is also expected to surpass Coors as the second largest brand family in the U.S. retail in short order. Corona Extra remains the engine of the Corona brand family and continues to be the number one, most loved beer among general market and Hispanic consumers. For fiscal 2020, incremental media investments are expected to ignite Corona\u2019s core growth, including Corona draft, and can formats. As part of these efforts, we are increasing both English and Spanish language media across digital, social and TV, including heavy emphasis on the NFL and the NBA where Corona is expected to have a number one share of voice during the NBA playoffs and finals. Corona Premier was the number one new brand introduction in both volume and dollars last year and was larger than the number two and the number three product innovations combined. We are seeing strong repeat purchases with consumers motivated by the low-cal, low-carb benefits of Corona Premier\u2019s premium image. Corona Premier is winning across all demographics, including our core Hispanic consumer base. To continue the momentum on Premiere in year two, we plan to increase our marketing investment double -digits across marketing channels including the launch of new creative for this brand. We are also significantly increasing support in both English and Spanish language media to reach Corona Premiere\u2019s diverse drinker base. Corona Premiere\u2019s national TV advertising focus will air in March through October with strong presence in sports programming, including sponsorships like the U.S. Open golf tournament, where we\u2019ll be a proud sponsor through at least 2021. New incremental distribution opportunities for Corona Premier include the launch of 18-pack bottles to provide trade-up opportunities in larger format channels as well as the national launch of Corona Premier Draft to lean into the momentum of brand and to provide opportunity for consumers to sample in on-premise. And last year\u2019s regional launch of Corona Familiar 6 and 12 packs, that brand became the fourth largest growth driver in the category and a top-10 high-end beer brand. The Corona Familiar 12-pack was the top package innovation in dollars and volume last year. And we believe this incremental runway for this brand, particularly with unacculturated Hispanic consumers. To fuel over additional growth, we recently launched Corona Familiar 24-pack bottles regionally to capture larger social occasions with current Hispanic consumers. For fiscal 2020, Corona Familiar\u2019s expansion will be supported through double-digit increase in Spanish language TV as well as digital, social and in-store merchandising to drive incrementality at retail. Let\u2019s move now to Casa Modelo. Modelo Especial is the leading growth engine in the entire U.S. beer market, posting double-digit depletion growth in 26 of the last 27 fiscal years. It is the fastest growing major beer in the industry, accounting for almost 40% of total category growth. Across the country, Modelo Especial is now the number one brand in three markets and the entire state of California and the number two brand in five additional major markets, growing double-digits in 41 of the 50 states. From a channel perspective, Modelo Especial continues to be the fastest growing brand in the on-premise with draft growing more than 25% last year. And in the off-premise, it became the number one selling beer in 7-Eleven, the biggest retailer and the biggest class of trade in beer. Modelo Especial has incremental momentum and its superior velocity should command more space at retail when compared with other top-10 brands. The number of Especial drinkers is up versus last year for both Hispanics as well as non-Hispanics, as we continue to grow both penetration and loyalty with our core Hispanic base and the general market consumer. We\u2019ve seen an incredible 60% increase in general market drinkers over the past two years but we still have lots of opportunity as we estimate that less than 5% of the general market currently drinks Modelo. So, with this much momentum on Especial and the household penetration that still under indexes major brands, we believe that this brand has a long runway for growth. For fiscal 2020, we expect to make our biggest ever investment in marketing support behind Modelo. We plan to continue to engage our core Hispanic consumer by increasing our investment in Spanish language TV and we\u2019ll be a major player in live sports, led by soccer, rounded out by strong presence in the NFL, Major League Baseball and NBA games. We will be upping our game on NFL Sundays and will strengthen our college football presence with the new addition of NCAA football for the first time. We plan to complement our live sports activity with significant investment in top rated entertainment programming across Univision and Telemundo while increasing our digital and social media activities as well. We will also be launching literally one of our biggest new items with the rollout of the Modelo 32-ounce bottle as the single-serve segment continues to be on fire. It also offers a trade-up opportunity as almost 75% of the volume in this 32-ounce format is held by domestic low-end brands that are in decline. Let\u2019s turn to Pacifico, our up-and-comer brand of our portfolio, selling almost 10 million cases this past year. The brand is attracting new drinkers, especially outside its core California market and has seen double-digit growth in many of these markets through increased awareness with the national expansion of Live Life Anchors Up campaign. For fiscal 2020, we plan to push Pacifico aggressively through increased investment behind national media and sponsorships as well as expansion in digital, via Facebook and Instagram. We\u2019re increasing our national TV presence for additional engagement with consumers on key entertainment properties, like The daily show as well as live sports like the NBA playoffs, the NHL playoffs and Major League Baseball. And with more than 50 million Americans now participating in action sports, Pacifico is continuing its partnership with ESPN as the official beer sponsor of action sports\u2019 biggest events, the summer and winter X Games. We\u2019ve added a new Pacifico partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard team, and we will be the official beer sponsor of the Burton U.S. Open of Snowboarding. The growth opportunities though don\u2019t end there. Innovation is the second piece of the equation. It gives us confidence in our high single-digit top-line growth expectations for fiscal 2020. We\u2019re building a strong pipeline of new, innovative products, leveraging the power of our existing brands to fill gaps in our portfolio and complement our core franchises. We will continue to invest in early stage emerging brands that are both scalable with high growth and high margin potential. Our goal is to drive sustainable, high-end share growth through consumer-driven innovation that recruits new drinkers, expands occasions and adds value to the category. But, we will do it in a very disciplined and focused way. During fiscal 2020, we\u2019ll extend the Corona master brand to take advantage of consumer trends with the national launch of Corona Refresca. Corona Refresca brings a completely new drinker to the Corona franchise and allows us to carve out a space within the large and growing FMB category that\u2019s anchored in Corona\u2019s carefree lifestyle. Beginning this month, we\u2019re launching Corona Refresca nationally, in guava lime, and passionfruit lime 6 packs, plus a new variety 12-pack with the added flavor of coconut lime. This year, we\u2019re also testing Wildish which is to be introduced as a seltzer in the Northeast and as a tea in one to two additional test markets. It is being positioned as a platform to capture the opportunity driven by the health and wellness trend. And then, there\u2019s western standard, one of my personal favorites. This offers a high-end fashionable sessionable, full flavored beer that will be available in five states, this coming year. Alera and El Grito [ph] are products specifically developed to meet the needs of the fast-growing Hispanic consumer. Alera is an FMB that was created for bicultural and acculturated Hispanic and general market women, and will be offered in four test markets this year, while El Grito [ph] is a newly created beer that will be part of our planned Four Corners expansion. Now turning to the operations side of our beer business. As planned, we have completed the 30-million-hectoliter capacity expansion, at Nava, which brings our existing capacity, including Obregon to 34 million hectoliters. This marks a monumental achievement over the past five years to provide ample supply to meet the growing demand for our beer portfolio, while completing the project on time and on budget. Furnace number five is underway at Nava and expected to be producing glass by the end of this calendar year. And we will continue to make progress ahead of schedule with the 5-million-hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which I highlighted last quarter. The Mexicali capacity expansion continues with expected completion by fiscal 202023. As a reminder, upon completion, this planned expansion project will represent roughly 10% of our beer capacity in Mexico. To sum it up, I am excited about the strong, high single-digit growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2020. As you can see, we have excellent opportunities to grow our business through a combination of enhanced distribution and consumer innovation across our portfolio. And now just a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be a leading share in the Canadian recreational cannabis market, supported by solid product inventories, a national sales force and the rollout of value-add products, including soft gel caps, oral sprays, and pre-rolls. Throughout calendar 2019, we expect Canopy to benefit from favorable changes in the recreational Canadian market as brick and mortar retail stores come online and stimulate new growth in larger provinces like Ontario. Canopy is also preparing to deliver incremental value-added recreational products, including vapes, beverages and else, which are related to come on line in the fall of this year in Canada. We share Canopy\u2019s view that a significant opportunity exists going forward for the inclusion of cannabis as an ingredient in future consumer products and medical therapies. Canopy\u2019s current patent portfolio includes more than 35 issued patents and 195 patient applications, including those related to a unique process it has developed to produce cannabis-based beverages, which are expected to be available when Canadian regulations open up this fall. So, in closing, I hope your key takeaways from my comments this morning are as follows. One, I am confident in the ability of our beer business to generate industry-leading, high-single-digit growth trends for fiscal 2020 with the initiatives we already have underway for this year. Two, fiscal 2020 will be a dynamic year for our wine and spirits business. A tighter focus on high-performing brands strengthens the business and strategically positions it for future growth and success. Three, we are working closely with Canopy Growth on a focused long-term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter, while paving a clear path to profitability. We are confident in their ability to achieve the previously communicated run-rate of $1 billion next year. And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for fiscal 2019 and provide guidance for the coming year. David? David Klein : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. In fiscal 2019, we grew net sales and comparable basis EPS by 7% and produced a three-year comparable basis EPS CAGR of 20%. In addition, we generated over $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, returned over $1 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and completed our incremental investments in Canopy Growth. Let\u2019s look at full-year fiscal 2019 performance in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Net sales grew 12%, primarily due to volume growth of 10% and favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 9%, depletion growth was lower than shipment growth, primarily due to year-end timing as poor weather conditions, especially on the West Coast, muted our February depletion result, after experiencing strong depletion trends during the winter holiday months of December and January. As a result, distributor inventory levels finished the year higher than expected. Beer gross margin increased 10 basis points to 54.4% as favorability in pricing was essentially offset by higher COGS, which were primarily related to transportation cost headwinds. Given the challenging cost environment, I\u2019m pleased with this result, as our operational cost and efficiency initiatives helped offset the impact of other cost increases, like depreciation. Marketing, as a percent of net sales, increased 30 basis points to 9.3%, reflecting incremental investment in support of successful innovation activities. This result came in 20 basis points lower than our previous 9.5% target as we tactically balanced our marketing investments. As a result of the above mentioned factors, operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.3%, which is best-in-class amongst North American brewers. Moving to wine and spirits. Shipment volumes were down 1% and net sales were flat, reflecting a slight pricing benefit. Shipment volume ran ahead of depletion volume for the year. Operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 26.5%, primarily due to higher COGS and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. The higher COGS primarily reflect increased freight and transportation costs. Corporate expenses increased $32 million, primarily in support of growth and technology initiatives. Comparable basis interest expense for the year increased 17% to $387 million. This reflects approximately $55 million in interest expense related to the funding for our incremental investment in Canopy Growth in November of 2018. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year moves down a percentage point to 18% which was in line with our guidance. Now let\u2019s review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 9%, primarily due to volume growth of 8% and favorable pricing. This net sales result came in ahead of our previous expectation due to the shipment and depletion timing items I mentioned earlier. Beer gross margin increased 50 basis points to 53.8%, primarily due to pricing and FX benefits, partially offset by higher transportation costs. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 6.4% or 160 basis points lower than Q4 last year. Primarily, as a result of these factors, operating margin increased 240 basis points to 40.5%. Wine and spirit shipment volume was down 9% and net sales were down 8%. While Q4 shipments ran below depletions, we finished fiscal 2019 with shipments outpacing depletions. Operating margin increased 60 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to benefits from lower SG&A and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher COGS, driven largely by increased grape and transportation costs. We recorded $17 million of equity loss on a comparable basis or $0.06 per share related to our Canopy investment. As a reminder, we\u2019re recognizing our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings on a two-month lag. As such, we recognize our share of Canopy earnings for only two months, November and December, which is included in Canopy\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 results. In our Q4 reported basis financial results, we recognized an additional $1.2 billion pretax net gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy warrants and convertible notes, bringing the total pretax net gain on our Canopy fair value investments to almost $2 billion for fiscal 2019. We also recorded a $108 million impairment charge related to the trademark value of Ballast Point. While this investment has not met expectations as the craft marketplace has slowed since our acquisition, it has increased our leadership position in the high-end of U.S. beer, and provided us an innovation in operating platform in the craft and specialty category to contribute to future growth. These items were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. Moving to fiscal 2019 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $1.4 billion compared to $874 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $2.2 billion, up 16%, primarily driven by beer earnings growth. Operating cash flow came in below our expectation, primarily due to cash flow underperformance in the wine and spirits business. CapEx totaled $886 million, which was 16% below last year\u2019s spend. CapEx spending was favorable versus our previous expectation, primarily due to timing. Given the accelerated pace of the 5 million hectoliter expansion at the Obregon facility, we\u2019ve been able to shift out the timing of some of the spend, related to our Mexicali brewery build. Moving to our fiscal 2020 P&L and free cash flow outlook. For fiscal 2020, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.80. This excludes Canopy equity earnings and assumes the transaction to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business for $1.7 billion will close at the end of Q1. Primarily as a result of this transaction, we expect fiscal 2020, wine and spirits\u2019 net sales to decrease to 25% to 30% and operating income to decrease 30% to 35%. During fiscal 2019, for the businesses sold, shipment volume was 28 million cases; net sales was $1.1 billion; and gross profit after marketing was $389 million. We have also identified approximately $130 of standard costs resulting from the transaction. The Company\u2019s developing plans to eliminate these costs during the fiscal 2020 to fiscal 202021 time frame. We currently expect to realize $35 million to $55 million of these cost reductions during fiscal 2020 and have factored them into our fiscal 2020 guidance. For Q2 through Q4 of fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019, the shipment volume, net sales and gross profit after marketing cost for the businesses being sold totaled 21 million cases, $852 million and $303 million, respectively. When you exclude these Q2 through Q4 amounts from our fiscal 2019 wine and spirits results, our remaining wine and spirits business is targeting net sales growth of low to mid single digits and operating income growth of high single digits for fiscal 2020. We expect to incur a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in connection with the cost reduction plan that\u2019s being developed. We\u2019ve not reflected this change in our fiscal 2020 reported basis guidance. In addition, we have not included any potential net gain or loss in our fiscal 2020 reported basis guidance. Both items will be excluded from our fiscal 2020 comparable basis guidance. We expect most of the wine and spirits shipment planning benefit for fiscal 2019, that I mentioned earlier, to reverse in Q1 fiscal 2020. As a result, Q1 fiscal 2020 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT is expected to decrease 10% and 20%, respectively. For fiscal 2020, our beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth in the range of 7% to 9%, and our full-year operating margin to approximate 39%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our import portfolio. We expect gross margin to be flattish as cost inflation headwinds primarily related to glass, raw materials, transportation and labor cost in Mexico are expected to be mostly offset from product pricing and productivity initiatives. As mentioned earlier, beer marketing expense as a percent of net sales finished fiscal 2019 at 9.3%. For fiscal 2020, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to increase slightly around 20 basis points to 9.5% to support the innovation and brand growth initiatives outlined earlier by Bill. We expect some of the beer shipment timing benefit that we recognized at the end of fiscal 2019 to reverse in Q1 fiscal 2020. As a result, Q1 fiscal 2020 beer net sales and operating income growth is expected to increase mid single digits. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million. This includes approximately $105 million of incremental interest expense associated with the financing of our November 2018 Canopy investment. This brings the total Canopy-related interest expense to $160 million.  Net proceeds from the wine and spirits transaction will be used to pay down debt. And an interest expense reduction of approximately $40 million has been factored into our fiscal 2020 guidance for this item. Our tax rate is expected to approximate 17%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at $195 million. This guidance assumes no share repurchases for fiscal 2020. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico Beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries, and a fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. This expansion CapEx spend is below our previous fiscal 2020 guidance as we\u2019ve shifted out the timing of spend for Mexicali. For fiscal 2021 and 2022, we expect total Company CapEx to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million per year. This includes $200 million to $400 million of maintenance CapEx across the total Constellation business. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we expect beer expansion project CapEx to moderate from the $600 million level in fiscal 2020 as we work to complete the buildouts of Obregon and Mexicali. While our fiscal 2020 comparable basis EPS is moving down due to the wine and spirits divestiture, we remain committed to growing our dividend and have increased our quarterly dividend slightly. As summarized in the earnings release, fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings totaled $9.34 per share. As mentioned earlier, we expect comparable basis, diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.80 per share. Canopy\u2019s business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they invest behind their growth opportunities. Additionally, as Canopy\u2019s planning process for the next fiscal year is ongoing and the Canopy equity earnings we recorded in our income statements are non-cash, we\u2019ve not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal 2020 guidance. This will allow us and our investors to focus on the underlying performance of our core business. In closing, the actions we are taking in fiscal 2020 will provide us a more premium portfolio of wine and spirits with the stronger growth and financial profile. This, along with the opportunities we plan to capture to increase our leadership position in high-end beer has us very excited about the future. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good morning, guys. So, clearly, a lot of areas in the beer depletion growth within fiscal Q4 with the great start that you mentioned, and then the weaker end of the quarter dampened, I guess literally by weather. So, I\u2019d love to get more detail on if you think the softness in February was just weather-related or is there any other factors that may linger and any update on march, if you\u2019re expecting sort of if you\u2019re now back with that full -year trajectory that you\u2019re expecting? And then, just second on Premier on the beer depletion front. I guess, what level of growth are you expecting out of that brand in fiscal 2020, and what gives you confidence that it can build and grow in year two? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Yes. The entire scenario around the slight weakening at the end of the fourth quarter was driven by weather. The last two weeks in state of California, which as we all know is our biggest market, was literally wet, soaking wet. In fact, only 1% of the state of California today is in drought conditions and just a few years ago that number was in 90 plus range. So, we literally saw everything dampen in the last couple of weeks. You combine that with the polar vortex that we had in the northern tier of states, and it was a literal weather mess for the last couple of weeks of our fiscal. We are, though, very pleased with the start of our march and we feel that it\u2019s consistent with the guidance that we just provided. Relative to your question on Premier, we expect Premier growth to be in the 30% to 45% range this coming year. So, we see significant upside in that brand beyond the results that we saw this past year. As most of you know, Premier virtually doubled what our expectations were in its first year and we expect that acceleration to continue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about innovation. So, a lot of activity in the ABA space broadly. So, first, could you talk a little Refresca from test markets, is it largely incremental? But how big those FMBs when they launched as they hit -- they can hit really big, but sort of trajectory generally speaking for a lot of these brands has been year two or year three is a real struggle. So, as you look for planning out the future of Refresca, how do you manage that kind of boom-bust scenario and what are your general expectations for year one? Then secondarily, you mentioned Alera. So, how does that intersect with Corona Refresca in terms of positioning and marketing, knowing that\u2019s still just in test market? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Let me cover those. Refresca, in our test markets, had tremendous incrementality. In fact, it was even better than Premier was. So, we are very excited about the opportunity to put a strong recognized brand, like Corona packaged as Refresca into a separate area of the store, both on your retail shelves and in the cold box. It appeals to a much broader demographic than what our core beer business does. And we think it opens up a wonderful vehicle with the strength of the carefree lifestyle that Corona represents for our business. Alera, on the other hand is much more focused to Hispanic women, also multicultural women, but Hispanic women specifically. And that will be somewhat different than what we see as the demographic profile around Refresca. As you know Alera will only be in test market. We have a very defined approach to innovation where we test and learn in year one; and as we see success, we expand. Much like we did with Premier, we\u2019re doing the same thing with Refresca and we will do that assessment with Alera and El Grito [ph] and things of that nature as well, so that we have a focused approach and disciplined approach to our innovation agenda. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open. Gerald Pascarelli : Hi. This is Gerald Pascarelli on for Vivien. Thanks very much for taking the question. So, just kind of building on Refresca, the national rollout, obviously encouraging and bringing a sale to the market. As you guys look to build out your portfolio, are there any gaps that you see that you might want to invest in and kind of enter, not just across beer but across spirits as well? Bill Newlands : Sure. We obviously do a lot in our -- through our Chief Growth Officer, and assessing what consumer opportunities and segments are available to us. That\u2019s frankly how we got to Premier, that\u2019s frankly how we got to Refresca and how we\u2019ve gotten to Alera and other things that we are testing. We certainly see an opportunity in higher-end sessionable domestic beer. That\u2019s why Western Standard is being tested in five western states this year. I personally am very excited about the opportunity around that. And it\u2019s a bit of one of those, what I would describe as, category blurring. It is a lager that stand has time in high west barrels. So, it has the benefits and it\u2019s really what we\u2019re calling a Saloon Lager. It\u2019s a great opportunity to leverage existing capabilities that we have but also put us into a new area as consumers continue to trade up. We\u2019re also evaluating and will continue to evaluate new things. I used the example of our Bourbon Barrel-Aged wine programs, which as I mentioned in my remarks, have generated over 1 million cases from zero and under two years. So, we will continue to find those niche opportunities that we believe are big, impactful and sustainable, whether it\u2019d be in our beer business or in our wine and spirits business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on your update -- or your FY2020 EPS guidance. It excludes the expected dilution from Canopy and I think it appears a bit low, so possibly conservative. So, I guess I was hoping you could touch on that and your level of conviction. Then, I was hoping to get a sense of your level of visibility with Canopy and if you have any sense of when equity earnings from Canopy will inflect positive. And then, I think earlier, you have mentioned that you were expecting that to happen by the end of this year. So, I just wanted to confirm that. And I also wanted to understand, you mentioned that you\u2019re not going to include Canopy in your FY guidance. So, just wanted to confirm that that continues through this year, and how you think about it in the out years, such that Canopy is no longer a drag on earnings, will you possibly start to include it then? Thanks. David Klein : Yes. So, let me take it kind of in two parts. So, on our base level guidance, Bonnie, our guidance is really out there for beer, in line with our medium-term growth algorithm, in the 7 to 9% range kind of centering on that 39% operating margin which we think is aggressive but achievable, and again, in line with our medium-term expectations. For wine and spirits, once we have closed on our transaction, we have a base underlying business that we think, as a result of more focus from ourselves internally where we can apply our ability to drive connectivity with our consumers, better performance in our operations, maybe some pricing along the way that we\u2019ll be able to deliver over time mid-single digit growth and achieve the 30% operating margins that Bill talked about. The headwind there really for FY20 for us is the stranded cost removal. And so, we\u2019ve baked into our guidance between $35 million and $55 million of cost take out of the total of $130 million. Maybe the reason why we couldn\u2019t be more aggressive with that number is related to timing in the year when the costs come out -- for some of the costs. And the fact that some of the costs will be coming out of COGS and COGS overhead which will take time to come through our P&L and won\u2019t likely show up until next year. So, we think the story stays completely on our medium term guidance. We\u2019d just have to work through some of the near-term work. Shifting to Canopy, we still are confident, as Bill called out that the Canopy business will be generating over $1 billion in run rate net sales at the end of their upcoming fiscal year. We expect to be able to see profitability out of the markets that they were in when we did the transaction, so meaning Canada, medical and rec as well as some international medical markets. We would still expect to be able to see that come through our numbers in FY 2021. So, our view on Canopy hasn\u2019t changed. But, let me just touch on guidance or the like thereof. I\u2019m personally disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to get to be able to provide guidance for the fiscal year on Canopy. But, there are couple of factors that played into that. The first is, the planning process at Canopy isn\u2019t completed. In fact, the Board and the management team will be going through their plans over the next couple of weeks. Secondly, we\u2019re seeing changes literally as we speak, because this week brick and mortar sales started to take place in the province of Ontario. We still don\u2019t have clarity on CBD products, how they\u2019ll be regulated in the U.S. And of course, we expect different form factors to come on line in Canada later in the year, but that timing could move around a little bit. So, we looked at all of these factors and we felt that we would probably just make things less clear to our investors, if we tried to provide some very broad guidance range that would take into account all of these factors. And in any event, we\u2019re going to show Constellation ex-Canopy equity and earnings in our results. And so, that\u2019s what we provided to you today. We do expect at some point to be able to provide, at least a broad range of guidance for Canopy; we were just unable to do it today. And since I\u2019ve already missed on that commitment, I\u2019m not going to commit on when we\u2019ll be able to do that, but we\u2019ll get there as soon as we can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning. So, I guess, my first question is just one clarification. David, your comment about the mid-single digit sales growth in beer in Q1, can you just clarify how much under shipment you are expecting in Q1 specifically? And then, my broader question is really on your marketing investment. So, throughout fiscal 2019, it seems like that number has come down a little bit. You talked about tactically balancing the investment. I just want to get a little bit more color on what you meant by that. And then, when you look at fiscal 2020, obviously a lot of innovations and a lot of activities even on the core. So, I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if you are looking to grow efficiencies in terms of marketing. Are you looking at that in sort of the different ways or is sort of the return you\u2019re getting, perhaps sort of influencing how much you are spending on some of these brands at this point. David Klein : Okay. So, in terms of Q1, Judy, let me just kind of step back a little and talk about the ships and depletion growth rate in balances over the last couple of years. So, in FY18 depletes grew faster than ships and in FY19 ships grew faster than the depletes. We would expect in FY20 that we\u2019ll end up with a year where the depletes grow little bit faster than ships, just as a general comment. And by the way, the actual volume deltas between these, really is in -- is small number of cases, call it 1 million or 2 million cases a year. And so, we just have different growth rates as a result of different numerators between ships and depletes. So, in the first quarter, we have an imbalance to unwind. That gets us to the mid single digits even while we are on target -- mid single digit growth in ships in the first quarter even while we are on target for our full-year depletion growth rate. So, again, just timing. And as Bill mentioned that imbalance really happened because of the way we plan out our shipments versus our depletions, happens within a 10-day to 2week sort of window. And the last couple of weeks, the February depletions just slowed down for reasons Bill described. Shifting to the marketing question, our philosophy really hasn\u2019t changed. I would say that our marketing team headed by Jim Sabia does an outstanding job of both getting really good returns on our marketing investment while they\u2019re squeezing as hard as they can on the dollars that are applied to non-working marketing. Our returns haven\u2019t diminished. And so, we remain committed to driving the real value add marketing spend. What really happens is, we believe that we should be spending about 9.5% on marketing. And just as a result of timing of ad placement and that sort of thing, we ended up a little bit light in FY19 but we expect to be that in 9.5% range in FY20. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Powers : Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks. So, I guess, first, just -- I wanted to just confirm that you\u2019re still holding to your CAGNY comments of roughly 10% EPS CAGR off the reported by 9.28 base that you just finished in 2019, just a clarification there. And my real question is on the wine sale, and how -- just a question on how you\u2019re thinking about the valuation. On a trailing basis, it looks like the transaction was done at about 6 times EBITDA, which is more or less in line with some of your prior comments. I guess, I was a little surprised in that context with the magnitude of the strength of overheads, because on a contribution margin basis, it looks like Gallo is paying closer to 4 times. So, just a little bit more color around how you thought about that. And just one last, just clarification, the restructuring charge is in not in your outlook, but I\u2019m assuming that any cash outlays related to that effort are in your free cash outlook and just hoping you could confirm that. Thanks. David Klein : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with that one because that\u2019s easy. Yes, anticipated restructuring cash cost we have include in our cash outlook. However, as you highlighted, we excluded that from our numbers from a P&L standpoint. And so, now, I\u2019ll go back to your first question. Yes. We are still on track for a 10% EPS growth. Remember that that guidance was really on a three to five-year basis. But our models, even as we roll our plan into it and have final FY19 numbers, we continue to support 10% EPS growth using FY19 as a base. So, now, let\u2019s talk about the transaction value itself. So, I think we called out in our release some of the details about the contribution after marketing spend. If you look at the brands on a trailing basis, yes, you\u2019re in the 6ish range, between 6 and 7 on a trailing basis. These brands are declining mid to high single digits. So, on forward basis, you\u2019re more in line with 7 or slightly above 7. We also have a fair amount -- most of the can that we sold is branded can. We also have a couple of ancillary businesses such as our concentrate business and our polyphenolics business that were included in the sale as well because they actually reside at the Mission Bell facility. So, when we look at the transaction on a multiple basis, we're comfortable with it. When we look at the transaction on a DCF basis, we're comfortable with it. And on an accounting basis, we are comfortable as well. So, I think the important thing though, the takeaway from the transaction is the strategic merit for Constellation and being able to direct to their attention to these higher margin brands that remain in our portfolio. We believe that if we put the sort of thinking and maybe discipline that we've applied to our very-focused portfolio in beer to this portfolio, and wine and spirits, we can have some pretty impressive results. And that's really the point of the transaction. It's more the strategic merits than the economic merits, but we think it was a fair deal all around. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Robert Ottenstein : Just one quick point of clarification. Have you finished the sales in the wine and spirits business, is this what you had intended, is it done? And then, my real question, can you talk a little bit more about the potential for Pacifico, how you are sizing, how big that brand could be? And what you're seeing in terms of incrementality on that brand? Bill Newlands : We view this as the optimization effort in its entirety, for your first question. The second question about Pacifico, we were very excited around Pacifico, it has grown double -- grew double digits this past year outside of the core California base as the advertising campaign that we had associated with it kicked in and worked very well. I think we're going to continue to see this brand be a double-digit growth driver for us going forward as it extends itself. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have extended some of our sponsorship opportunities with this brand, and we'll continue to do sort of the edgy ex-gain type of approaches that we think Pacifico has become known for, and we think it's got some continued success to come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Thank you. Hello, everybody. So, my question is on beer. So Bill mentioned -- Bill, you mentioned that you expect a mere to have about 35% growth embedded in fiscal '20 guide. So what is the total assumption for the Corona family as a whole and for Modelo insight guidance? Bill Newlands : Our expectations is that the Corona family after growing 7% during this past year will probably be in the mid-single-digit range for this coming year. Premier, we do expect, as I said earlier, to be a significant growth driver as part of that and we expect the overall brand family to be in the mid-single-digit range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy : A quick housekeeping question for Dave and then one for Bill. So David, housekeeping after-tax proceeds in the $1.7 billion sale of wine assets and then whether you had any flexibility to buy back the stock as opposed to paying down debt? And then Bill for you on pricing, just given the protracted volume declines in the industry over long period of time, do you see any potential that the big domestic brewers become less rational at some point? How do you sort of handicap the possibility of that and potential implications for your portfolio? Thanks for both of those. David Klein : So, Kevin, we are not prepared to really talk about the after-tax proceeds, but it will be a fairly efficient transaction for us from that perspective. We do intend to repurchase stock, as we've said before as soon as we are comfortably within our targeted leverage ratio range of three to four times. We haven't built anything into our guidance. We'll see how the year unfolds, but we would very much like to be buying our stock at this point and we'll do so as quickly as we can. Bill Newlands : Relative to your question on pricing, I mean, we continue to feel as we have that there is 1% to 2% pricing within our beer business on an ongoing basis. As you know our brands have strong consumer demand attached to those and we continue to feel that opportunity is going to be there for us as we continue into the foreseeable future. Relative to -- and I don't know if that was uniquely to beer I would say, we are putting some of the same capabilities on our remaining wine and spirit business that we have put on our beer through revenue management and we expect to see both mix and pricing benefits coming out of our wine and spirit business, which quite frankly we had been relatively unable to get in the recent past with our remaining portfolio, which we think is much more conducive to pricing and mix benefits. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Just two quick ones. David, do you've any sense on what depreciation and amortization is sort of ongoing asset divestitures? David Klein : I don't have that off the top of my head, but clearly that's something that we can provide at some point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from... David Klein : I think, Bryan -- sorry, she didn't give you chance for your second question. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Shannon, can you let Bryan back on the line, please? Operator : Sure, one moment. Bryan, your line is open. Bryan Spillane : And just a question on beer margins, David, can you just walk through a little bit more color on some of the pressure points on cost, on headwinds and cost of goods. I guess like glass and labor inflation that type of thing? And just how fixed that is, as you're kind of through the course of this year, meaning is there up chance or how much volatility could there be in that cost basket? David Klein : So, Bryan, if I knew you we're going to ask a beer margin question, we wouldn't have got you back on line. So yes, I think I've said this before that we're seeing labor inflation in Mexico in the 4% to 6% range, we're seeing cost contractual cost of glass increasing in the 4% to 6% range, in particular, coming out of our joint venture, which is producing about 55% to 60% of the glass that we use. We expect to see transportation headwinds in likely the high single digit range. We do expect to have some benefit clearly from pricing. But in order to hold our gross margins, not only do we have to get benefits from pricing and possibly FX, we have to also deliver on productivity improvements, which the team is diligently working toward. So I think all in all, given the sorts of headwinds that we're seeing and the pricing environment that we're anticipating with this 1% to 2%, price increase activity we feel pretty good about being able to have flattish gross margins during the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open. Timothy Ramey : Good morning. About the wine portfolio in 2021 kind of skip ahead and take this transition year out, have you modeled what net revenue per case might look like versus the current portfolio? Can you help us to understand where that was and where that's going? Bill Newlands : We are obviously running models as we speak about what we expect our remainco portfolio. As you would expect in a transaction of the size, the final dimension of what was going to be sold has just been recently completed. So, a lot of work is now being done on our forward looking wine piece. What I would say is this. I think, you should expect it to be significantly higher than what it has been, because as you know, the vast weighting of the portfolio that has been sold is that reflecting under $11 on a retail price basis. So, the overall average out-the-door price point for our remainco brands will be significantly higher than it was. And we'll be able to give you a more concrete answer to that as we get the work done. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is open. Sean King : Hi. Thanks for the question. Yes. The $0.75 dividend came in lower than at least our expectation. Are you thinking any differently about the, I guess the cadence or composition of the $4.5 billion return to shareholders over the next three years? David Klein : No, not at all. We feel really bullish about that, Sean, what -- we've been targeting a 30% payout rate at our business and as a result of the disposition of some of the wine brands as our net income came down are actual at that 30% number, our payout would have come down. We wanted to keep it in line with where it was last year. And quite honestly, show a slight increase, so that's what we offered up. It really is more in keeping on track at that 30% target, more than it is any kind of indication around comfort level with being able to return the $4.5 billion we remain absolutely committed to that. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. Brett Cooper : Thanks. Two questions. What do you guys expect to get in terms of incremental placement, as you go into the spring with the new products that you're rolling out? And then as you're putting more products, more packages in there, how do you guys think about driving velocity growth for the total beer business and the importance of doing that? Bill Newlands : Sure. As we've shared it at prior discussions, we believe that as our algorithm for growth that roughly 50% of our growth profile will come out of increased distribution with an increase of the innovation agenda to 30% and then various other miscellaneous things. So, we continue to feel that there remains a lot of opportunity in distribution as well as in formats like cans and draft and so forth that we alluded to earlier on the call. Relative to velocity, as you know, a lot of work has been done by our -- in our space management approach, that we have definitively proven improves the overall results in a beer section when our shopper first approach is undertaken. We are radically increasing the number of retailers that are engaged with this particular program, which we expect to have a significant and helpful velocity improvement, based on improving the overall space in the beer section. So, we believe with that particular element will be helpful not only for us but for the overall category, and we're excited about the opportunity around it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Great. Thanks very much, much appreciate all of you joining Patty, David and me today. Obviously, we're excited about our organic growth prospects for the coming year, and we're already hard at work, as you would expect to deliver these opportunities while continuing to invest in our brands and in our operations. We look forward to speaking with all of you again in late June, when we share the results of our first quarter for our new fiscal year. Before then, we certainly hope that you will choose some of our fine products for your spring celebrations including Cinco and Memorial Day weekend. Speaking of Cinco, look for us at the New York Stock Exchange, as we will officially kick off the summer selling season by ringing that closing bell. So, thanks again everyone, much appreciate your time. And have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q1 Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's first quarter 2020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter sales and earnings results, which reflect an excellent start to our new fiscal year. Before I get started with our business review, I would like to emphasize three key takeaways on this morning's call. Number one, we are confident in our ability to close the Wine and Spirits transaction with Gallo, which we expect will occur in the second half of calendar 2019. For now, we have updated our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to assume that we closed at the end of the second quarter, but we will adjust accordingly as we get more clarity on the exact timing. Meanwhile, we are fully committed to supporting our entire portfolio throughout the transition. Number two, the transformation strategy for our Wine and Spirits business is working, led by the power brands in our portfolio, which achieved over 4% depletion growth in the first quarter. This collection of faster-growing, high-margin brands is expected to drive the growth of the business going forward. And number three, we posted strong net sales and margin results for our beer business in the first quarter, driven by continued outstanding performance by our growth engine that is Modelo Especial. In addition, we are pleased with the nearly 7% overall depletion growth, even with Corona Extra seeing some impact from unfavorable weather in several of our largest markets during the quarter, while overlapping last year\u2019s highly successful launches of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar. Bottom line, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales and EBIT growth for our beer business in fiscal 2020. Speaking of beer, during the first quarter, the Constellation Beer business continued to gain share with growth across all channels, driving one-third of the growth of the high-end U.S. beer market. Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the number one spot as the top share gainer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of more than 17%, a sequential acceleration compared to our fourth quarter trend. We continue to reap the benefits of our Modelo advertising investments which are resonating with both our core and new consumers. We recently launched the Modelo 32-ounce bottle as we continue to take advantage of the single-serve and distribution trade up opportunities we have in the off-premise. We also made excellent progress in the on-premise with the Modelo draft format increasing more than 20% for the quarter. Corona Premier continues to drive the Corona brand family performance. The National TV advertising campaign as well as the draft rollout are propelling the momentum of this brand, which was a top share gainer in IRI channels while also posting double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. This summer, Corona Premier began a multi-year sponsorship deal with the United States Golf Association to be a proud supporter of the U.S. Open. And the newest innovation in the Corona brand family, Corona Refresca which launched nationally at the end of May, has already gained all commodity volume or ACV distribution of more than 30 since its introduction. Pacifico also produced strong double-digit depletion growth this past quarter driven by the national advertising campaign and retail promotions which are increasing Pacifico\u2019s in-store presence. Overall, I believe we are well positioned throughout the remainder of the summer selling season with a great lineup of marketing and promotional activities to support the ongoing growth momentum of our entire beer portfolio. Moving now to Wine and Spirits. As you know, Robert Hanson was recently hired as our new President of the Wine and Spirits business. Robert was previously a six-year valued member of our Board of Directors and has extensive consumer product experience from his prior senior management roles at John Hardy, American Eagle Outfitters, and Levi Strauss. Robert shares the Constellation passion for developing brands that consumers love and we are thrilled that he has joined our executive management team. Welcome to Robert. The Wine and Spirits business delivered first quarter results that exceeded our previously communicated expectations. As I mentioned, our power brands posted industry-leading depletion growth of over 4% for the first quarter. This portfolio includes key brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA Vodka, The Prisoner and High West, which continued to outperform the market and gain share. Overall, we expect these brands to be the key drivers of the business long-term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher margin brands. In addition, our Wine and Spirits innovation agenda has been successful with a focus on fast-growing categories, emerging formats and new flavor combinations. We will continue to expand our Bourbon Barrel Aged innovation program, which has been a resounding success, selling over 1 million cases in its first two years. A great example includes the new Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rye Barrel-Aged Red Blend, which is the first Rye Barrel-Aged wine introduced at a super premium price point. In July, we'll begin shipping Eternally Silenced, which is the first Pinot Noir addition to the Prisoner portfolio. This premium product introduction will be sold in the over $50 price segment. We will continue to support our innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. We have solid programming in place for our key power brands this summer, including the launch of a new TV advertising campaign for the Woodbridge portfolio. In addition, we have forged a relationship with the NFL to not only promote and sell our Woodbridge brand, but to introduce our new Crafters Union, Wine in a Can, which is the perfect format for football games and tailgating. Kim Crawford continues to align with consumers through its partnership with the U.S. Open and other major tennis events and recently launched a new TV and digital advertising campaign that will be featured this summer. These campaigns and sponsorships are just a few examples of the initiatives we have planned to strengthen the portfolio, drive consumer awareness and incremental growth. Our spirits portfolio has recently gained momentum with increases in growth and velocity across the SVEDKA portfolio bolstered by the new Bring Your Own Spirit national advertising campaign, plus the new innovation in the product line up SVEDKA Rose is already exceeding expectations. During the quarter, Constellation Ventures acquired a majority stake in Nelson's Green Brier, which is an iconic Tennessee Whiskey that plays well in emerging categories of American whiskey and craft. It is the first Ventures investment that will be fully integrated into the Constellation sales and distribution network, which provides a significant opportunity for growth of this brand. With our market reach, distributor partnerships and consumer insights, we are especially excited about the introduction of Nelson's Green Brier unique Tennessee whiskey to consumers this fall. While the award winning Belle Meade Bourbon brand continues its rapid market growth. As we begin the transformation journey for our Wine and Spirits business, I would like to reiterate our long-term goal for this business as we intend to grow net sales in the mid single-digit range with operating margins migrating to 30%. This quarter, we have made progress toward that goal and we look forward to shaping our Wine and Spirits business to be a best of class consumer goods portfolio with a market leading sales and margin profile. Now a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales. During the quarter, Canopy Growth and Acreage Holdings entered into an agreement that grants Canopy the right to acquire Acreage and enter the U.S. cannabis market once federally permissible. We are excited about this opportunity as it provides a path for Canopy to have a leading position in the U.S. upon federal cannabis reform. Recently, Canopy and Acreage shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction which will provide the opportunity for Constellation to extend the duration of Canopy warrants which provides long-term financial flexibility for cash deployment to our shareholders. David will provide additional details on that later in the call. And while we remain happy with our investment in the cannabis space and its long-term potential, we were not pleased with Canopy's recent reported year end results. However, we continue to aggressively support Canopy on a more focused long-term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter while paving a clear path to profitability. We believe some of these branded form factors include vape, beverages and edibles that will command higher margins. These products in Canada as well as CBD products in the U.S. are expected to come on line during the fourth quarter of this calendar year. In closing, I am pleased with our strong start to the year. Excellent execution of our first quarter results demonstrates that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives across our Beer, Wine and Spirits businesses, and I'm excited about the prospects across the business for the remainder of this year. With that, I would like to turn the call now over to David who will review our financial results from the quarter. David Klein : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2020 is off to a great start. Core business results exceeded expectations with operating cash flow up 18% and free cash flow up 30%. These strong results were primarily driven by our Beer business, which generated 12% operating income growth. We've increased our full-year comparable basis, diluted EPS range to $8.65 through $8.95. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and now assumes revised transaction timing to sell a portion of our Wine and Spirits business that Bill outlined. The $0.15 increase in EPS guidance represents one additional quarter of EBIT from the portion of the Wine and Spirits business that we've agreed to sell, partially offset by a delay in cost savings realization now expected to be at the low-end of our fiscal 2020 range of $35 million to $55 million and incremental interest expense due to debt paydown now targeted for the second half of fiscal 2020. After the transaction closes, we continue to expect to eliminate a total of $130 million of stranded costs from our Wine and Spirits business by the end of fiscal 2021. Now let's review Q1 performance in more detail, where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 7% on shipment volume growth of 5%. Shipment volume was higher than expected, primarily due to additional shipments made at the end of the quarter as part of efforts to mitigate potential tariff risks. As a result, the beer shipment timing benefit at the end of fiscal 2019 is now expected to reverse during the remainder of fiscal 2020 since it didn't occur in Q1. Depletion growth came in at 7% continuing our streak of excellent portfolio performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. This growth is compared to strong depletion growth in the prior year of 9% driven by new product launches generating two-year average growth of 8%. Beer operating margin increased 150 basis points to 39.3%, as favorability in pricing and FX were partially offset by higher transportation and logistics costs. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points to 11% driven by planned upfront marketing investments to support our brands leading into the summer selling season as outlined by Bill earlier. For fiscal 2020, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 7% to 9% and our full-year operating margin to approximate 39%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a reminder, we're facing a 10% depletion growth compare for Q2. In addition, we expect some of the shipment timing benefit mentioned earlier to reverse in Q2. And as a result, we expect Q2 net sales and EBIT growth to be in the mid-single digits range. We continue to expect our gross margin to be flattish for the year as cost inflation headwinds in growth investments are expected to be mostly offset from product pricing and productivity initiatives. Gross margin will also be impacted by the reversal of the shipment timing benefit in the remainder of fiscal 2020. We continue to expect fiscal 2020 marketing as a percent of net sales to increase around 20 basis points to 9.5% in support of our innovation and growth initiatives. Q1 fiscal 2020 Wine and Spirits net sales and operating income decreased 8% and 4% respectively. Q1 fiscal 2020 shipment volume declined 8% due to the fiscal 2019 shipment timing benefit mentioned last quarter. This mostly reversed in Q1, we expect the remaining fiscal 2019 shipment timing benefit to reverse in Q2, and this along with a difficult year-over-year comparison are expected to result in Wine and Spirits net sales in EBIT for Q2 fiscal 2020 to decrease 5% to 10% and 10% to 15% respectively. Our fast-growing, high-margin power brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA Vodka, The Prisoner, High West, and Schrader generated depletions of greater than 4%. Overall depletion trends of minus 1% were muted by lower-end brands. Wine and Spirits operating margin increased 90 basis points to 25.9% primarily due to favorable pricing along with lower marketing in SG&A costs partially offset by unfavorable mix. The lower marketing and SG&A benefits were due in part to a shift in timing of spend into Q2 as we have a significant ramp in spend to support the power brands during the summer selling season. This shift helped us outperform our original Q1 EBIT guidance. We now expect fiscal 2020 Wine and Spirits net sales to decrease 20% to 25% and operating income to decrease 25% to 30% due to the revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction discussed earlier. I'd like to echo Bill's confidence that the Wine and Spirits transformation strategy is already working. And as a result in fiscal 2020, we're targeting mid single-digit power brand depletion growth. Longer-term, we expect the business to produce mid single-digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. In Q1, we recognized $72 million of charges in connection with ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce the cost structure of the business. These charges, which are primarily related to the Wine and Spirits business, were excluded from comparable basis results. The charges include costs associated with certain write-downs of excess inventory, contract terminations, and organizational structure changes. Roughly, half of these charges are related to cash outlays expected to occur in fiscal 2020, which have been factored into our operating cash flow guidance. Interest expense for the quarter increased 31%, which reflects interest expense of approximately $40 million related to the funding for our incremental Canopy Growth investment in November 2018. Fiscal 2020 interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $435 million, which reflects incremental interest related to revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction, partially offset by anticipated rate favorability. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 17.6% versus 21.4% for Q1 last year, primarily driven by the overlap of unfavorable one-time items and a lower rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation benefit. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate in the 18% range. However, we continue to forecast our full-year fiscal 2020 effective tax rate to approximate 17% with stock-based compensation benefits expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $437 million of free cash flow compared to $336 million last year. This impressive 30% growth was primarily driven by strong beer operating cash flow results and lower CapEx. We now expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. This reflects revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction. We continue to expect CapEx of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries, and a fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. Shifting to our investment in Canopy Growth. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.6 billion. In Q1, we recognized an $828 million decrease in the fair value of the Canopy Growth investment, which was excluded from comparable basis results. As Bill mentioned, Canopy Growth and Acreage shareholders approved Canopy Growth's proposed acquisition of Acreage. As a result, certain Constellation warrants were modified to include longer duration and revised pricing. We expect to recognize a material gain on our modified Canopy warrants in Q2 to reflect these changes and will exclude that gain from comparable basis results. These warrant modifications allow Constellation more time to assess how the cannabis landscape is progressing before the warrants expire. Coupling our new warrant structure with our businesses strong cash generation provides incremental long-term flexibility for cash deployment to shareholders. So we remain committed to returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends from fiscal 2020 fiscal 2022. As summarized in the earnings release, first quarter fiscal 2020 comparable basis diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings impact totaled $2.40 per share, representing growth of 9%. Canopy's business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they invest in growth opportunities. Similar to this quarter, we plan to release an 8-K after Canopy reports earnings to disclose Canopy's impact on our quarterly results. I'd like to remind everyone, Canopy equity earnings recognized in our income statement are non-cash and we've not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal 2020 comparable basis EPS guidance range of $8.65 to $8.95. This will allow us and our investors to focus on the underlying performance of our core business. In closing, we're off to a strong start for fiscal 2020, as we continue to benefit from secular trends like premiumization and favorable demographics. We believe the investments we are making in support of growth opportunities today, position us to generate industry-leading growth, while we deliver on our fiscal 2020 commitments. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Good morning. William Newlands : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : So I guess I want to zero in on the beer depletion growth particularly around the Corona brand family. Clearly, the weather was a factor, but sort of how much does your analytics kind of point to weather being a factor versus Modelo obviously accelerating and you've talked about the cannibalization impact for Modelo and then clearly the Spiked Seltzer category kind of booming, how much is that also cutting into the Corona brand family? And kind of dovetailing that, if you think about the mid single-digit depletion guidance for second quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that other than just a comparison, how much is really the shipment on their performance or is there a little bit more caution around depletion just given the poor start to the summer given the weather? Thank you. William Newlands : All right, Judy. We will try to wrap that into one thought. So here we go. Look, we are comfortable with where Corona is as a brand. If you look at the most recent IRI trends through 6/16, Corona Extra is up admittedly against very tough overlaps with the weather challenges that we had during the first quarter. It's also appropriate to recognize that with the accelerating Modelo trends of 17% growth that certainly has some impact within the overall portfolio as well. And certainly, it's worth noting that Seltzer business has become a larger factor in the high-end than it had been in prior years. So all of those things certainly have some impact on the overall business. With all of that said, the overall family is roughly flattish. We are comfortable with where that business is looking, and as you noted, our overall depletion profile across our entire business was up just under 7% in the first quarter. If you in fact, look at June, while taking out the single day which happened to be a Friday that we lose in this quarter versus comparable quarter a year ago, the actual depletion rate in the month of June would be above the year-to-date depletion rate. David Klein : Yes. I want to just expand on that last point that Bill made. So in Q2 when we report our results, we lose a day of depletions, which doesn't come back until Q4. So it's an anomaly that you guys should factor into your models. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning. William Newlands : Hey, Bonnie. Good morning. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. Just a few more questions on Corona. First on Premier, I just wanted to hear from you guys were the results in the quarter better than you expected and if so why? And then on Corona Light, it's really still not where you want it to be. So maybe drill down a little bit further on any initiatives you might have to improve the brand? And then finally, how much further do you think you can extend the Corona brand? For instance, you're missing an opportunity right now in Seltzer, which just kind of touched on, is there a way to leverage one of your existing brands possibly Corona, and what could be the timing of that? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. So let's talk first about Premier. We were very pleased with the results of Premier in the first quarter. Keeping in mind, it was going against a year ago, when we introduced it, which automatically has the normal stock-up scenario when the brand was introduced. With all that said, it was up double-digits, and as you know, we have raised the advertising profile of that brand, and we'll be doing so for the remainder of this fiscal year. Relative to the overall family of Corona, as you know, we're very excited about Corona Refresco. We're off to an excellent start against that, and by the way, if any of you haven't had it I would strongly encourage you to do so. They are really delicious and very refreshing. So that is certainly the focus of our approach for this fiscal year and this summer selling season just to make sure that we maximize the potential of both Premier as well as Refresca in the overall mix of the Corona brand family. With all of that said, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have with Corona going forward. We do recognize that relative to your question about Seltzers that Seltzers have taken a larger piece of the growth profile in the high-end than they had in previous quarters and years. And certainly, our view is this. We explore all options where we have the ability to profitably participate in categories, and we will continue to do that. That's a standard way we operate. We will do that again going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. William Newlands : Hey, Nik. Nik Modi : The question is on Wine and Spirits. So I guess this new Mondavi Woodbridge ad campaign is hitting the airwaves now. Can you just talk a little bit about the process here that's different? Now that Jim has kind of taken over the CMO role, and do you have plans to do similar types of campaigns on other of your power brands in the near-term? William Newlands : Yes. As you know Nik, the Woodbridge brand is a critical brand for us just because of its sheer size and profitability. The advertising campaign that Jim and the rest of the marketing team have put together, we're very excited about. I don't know if you've seen it yet, if you haven't, I think it's highly compelling. We showed it to our Board yesterday, and we've just launched it this week, and we're very excited about the potential because it really speaks to Robert Mondavi's original goal to put great wine at every price point on every table. And I think the advertising that was developed does an exceptional job of suggesting just that. But we're not limiting our advertising efforts to that brand. As you've seen, we've spent and raised our profile in SVEDKA Vodka and the brand has responded. The SVEDKA growth profile has accelerated versus prior year. We will also be spending during the course of the summer months on both Meiomi and Kim Crawford. Kim Crawford in particular with its lead Sauvignon Blanc is a terrific wine for the summer season, and both that and Meiomi in addition to the others that I mentioned will all be supported during the coming selling season. David Klein : Yes. I'd add to that Bill that we've \u2013 I mentioned in my script that we had favorable price in our Wine and Spirits portfolio and that was primarily driven by our ability to get higher realized pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. Two brands that we're investing behind and it's that kind of approach to really nurturing CPG brands, where we're going to be able to charge appropriately for the equity that exists in the brand, but then we're going to spend back to help the consumers understand the value proposition that we're offering. That's why we're all really excited about our new approach to our power brands. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. We definitely got asked many times to the quarter sort of our view on the said discounting on Corona cans that was in some of the industry trade press. If you guys could just comment a little bit on pricing strategy for the Corona brand family overall? And to what degree that was sort of these plans and what went on during the quarter was already part of the full-year plan, and within that 1% to 2% pricing expectation for the portfolio or was something kind of newer that came up with the poor weather and so on? Thanks. William Newlands : Well, as you know, a lot of individual programming occurs with local retailers. It happens all the time on particular formats and sizes. While that was said, we achieved strong pricing in the quarter, up 1% to 2%, and we certainly have no uniform discussion of pricing and price promoting. Again, as I said a moment ago, price promotion occurs on a local level a lot, and it occurs usually on particular formats to get particular price points during key selling seasons. So we have not moved away from our normal expectation of 1% to 2% pricing. And in fact, we were quite successful in achieving price promotion during the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. Bill, I really appreciated your candor in your prepared remarks about your view of Canopy's most recent earnings results. So I just wanted to dig in on that. In terms of your disappointment in the quarter, I mean certainly the expanded EBITDA losses stand out, but was there any concern around the topline? So any more color around just that specific comment. And then as a follow-up to that, can you talk about your expectations relative to previous public commentary from CAGNY around the financial results for Canopy going forward? Thank you. William Newlands : Sure. We continue to expect that the run rate topline profile by the end of the next fiscal year will be in the $1 billion run rate range. With that said, and we need to all recognize. There are going to be splits and starts around a business like this when various form factors and products either have better acceleration or weaker acceleration of what everybody had anticipated. As you know, Ontario, which ultimately should be the biggest province has been a little behind some of the other provinces, in terms of opening stores, which always impacts things. So there is going to be some splits and starts in this thing. I think what we remain excited about is that this is going to be a big long-term business, and we are working with Canopy almost on a daily basis to ensure that we are all focused on the right things. The things that are going to drive the business, the things and the form factors that are going to matter in a way that gets to ultimate profitability for that business in an appropriate time frame. David Klein : Yes. Vivian, I'll comment on our previously made commentary around the business being accretive to our results in 2021. Those comments were predicated on Canopy's performance in Canada, their performance in their existing rest of world medical markets, return from our $4 billion investment, and they assumed we wouldn't have legalization in the U.S. because of course we know legalization in the U.S. would drive large P&L investments, which we'd all be happy to make to be able to participate in that large market. So let me just pick through those and talk about the current state. So in Canada, we know that this business is volatile as Bill outlined, but we think it's mostly on track with all of our expectations. We know that as it relates to FY2021 that the slight delay in edibles including beverages in Canada will likely impact our FY2021 because it's unlikely that Canopy will have the broad array of products in the market by calendar one \u2013 quarter one, calendar 2020, which will affect our first quarter of next year because of the two month lag on which we consolidate Canopy or we recognized income on Canopy. So Canada is on track, but we expect it to be volatile and the team at Canopy is quite good and really working their way through any execution issues that they may have had in the past. From the existing rest of world medical markets, we think those markets are on track, again real strong performance in those spaces by the Canopy team that we're pleased with. In terms of investment returns, we're very happy with the investment in Storz & Bickel, which you saw in their results last quarter. And we're extremely excited about the agreement with Acreage which, while expected to be a profitable company won't be consolidated and reported through the Canopy results in a way that would affect our numbers in the foreseeable future until there is a triggering event in the U.S. And then the last point is really on the unexpected legalization of CBD in the U.S., which will require a significant amount of investment, which Canopy has already announced. And we think that that's a good place for them to focus their money and their resources to really take advantage of what could be a very large and profitable market in the U.S. And we're really happy with how they're positioning themselves there. So look, we still are very bullish on our Canopy investment, and we're very happy, we made the investment when we did into this space which more and more people are starting to wake up to. As it relates to its effect on our financial results, we're going to continue to assess as we go through FY2020 as to how we will adjust our statements on the accretion or dilution effects on Constellation. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. William Newlands : Good morning. David Klein : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Clearly, beer margins came in better-than-expected in the quarter versus your flat implied expectation. I guess some of that was less of a Q1 inventory drawdown than expected. But that would appear to be only a modest portion to beer. So just curious for the lack of a full-year margin raise on the beer business, despite the big Q1 beat, is that more \u2013 we're just still early in the year or are there other factors in the remainder of the year that might reverse some of that Q1 upside? How should we think about that? William Newlands : Yes. So Dara, I think we still have concerns about the wage rate inflation in Mexico and increased costs of glass and other forms of packaging. We still have freight and logistics headwinds in the business that we continue to see. In Q1, we had some really good benefits from primarily pricing and FX, and some productivity improvements that were offset by the things that I just listed out. So and as you said, we had a bit of a benefit from over shipments in Q1, which works its way down to the growth in bottom line operating margin. In a comment on Q2, we expect that our marketing spend will be up slightly year-over-year in Q2, which will \u2013 have this coming probably a little lower than the 41.2% margin that we achieved in Q2. We tend to kind of max out our margins in Q2. So we'll run a little bit lower than that this year. And then I think any further growth in margins, away from the 39% target that we put out, which we feel is the right number for us for this year, will really be driven by maybe outsized gains in pricing or unexpected benefits from FX. So I think the 39% represents a pretty balanced view of the remainder of our full-year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Just want to get a little bit better feel for kind of the underlying consumer demand? It's a tricky quarter to do that, given some of the comps. And I was just wondering perhaps you could give your best guess of the impact of weather. We are thinking it could be, maybe 100 basis points, 200 basis points, is that too high? And also \u2013 we are also hearing that you got quite a nice amount of incremental shelf space in the quarter finally. Can you talk about that in terms of if that's right roughly the kind of timing of that in any way to quantify it? Thank you. David Klein : Yes, I'll take a shot at it and then Bill can fill in the hole. So I think from a consumer demand perspective, we've seen this volatility over the past few years, where we had a very strong April as you've seen in our results. And I think there is clearly a large effect from weather across the country, in particular in markets where we over index. I can't really comment on your range, our numbers \u2013 we can get it to that level of detail across the entire industry. But the biggest competition, the biggest change in consumer demand in the market that we've seen has been the result of the acceleration of Seltzers. It hasn't really been anything outside of weather, the result of other factors says affecting our portfolio of brands. William Newlands : The only thing I would add to that David is, and then we've touched on this a bit before, is that we are overlapping a very strong growth profile from last year in the same quarter with both Premier and Familiar. So to show the kind of overall depletion growth that we had in the quarter of just under 7%, we are quite pleased by. Any time you have two major overlaps and they were both very successful. And as you can see, Premier continues to be very successful overlapping the introduction. You will have some impact on your business. With that said, with almost 7% growth in the quarter, we're quite pleased with how the year is setting up. David Klein : And just one other point, Robert you mentioned a growing shelf space and you know that that's an important component that our sales team is laser-focused on. We've also seen in particular Corona Premier's 12-week based volume velocity increased by almost 25%. So we're seeing some really good signs in the marketplace, as it relates to our brands. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Questions for David, housekeeping on the guidance, and then one on return on capital, so quickly on the EPS guidance, despite the strong margin performance, it sounds like the upward revision to your EPS outlook is entirely due to the timing of the wind of divestiture, if you could just confirm that? And then with respect to the return of capital, you're maintaining the prior guidance of $4.5 billion in dividends in repurchases over the next few years, but that was prior to the more favorable terms of the Canopy warrants as part of the Acreage transaction. Maybe you can just comment on the greater flexibility that you have to potentially see that guidance? Thank you. David Klein : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. So yes, our guidance revision really reflects one additional quarter of the brands that are to be sold, offset by an increase in interest expense because we won't be receiving the cash from the sale in the same timeframe as we had anticipated, as well as because our \u2013 the transaction closes later in the year, our ability to get to the high-end of that $35 million to $55 million stranded cost takeout range is a significantly hindered, which is why we said we're more likely to be at $35 million for the year. But for clarity, still on track to hit $130 million total stranded cost takeout. And so the guidance change was really solely focused on the Wine and Spirits divestiture. As I said, we remain of the belief that we will end the year at 39% operating margins in our beer business. And in terms of cash return, Kevin, yes, we're really happy with the incremental flexibility that we get from the revisions to the warrants and we're just continuing to focus on the $4.5 billion of return to shareholders. I guess, that we want to as quickly as possible return $4.5 billion and then we'll decide what we do after that, but again, we simply remain focused on getting as much as we can out of our Canopy investment and returning cash to our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on the Focus brands within Wine and Spirits. And I guess there is some more advertising and marketing that you mentioned in response to Nik's next question earlier. Can you talk about maybe just over in the next year or two, kind of a longer timeframe? Are there like distribution opportunities or merchandising opportunities that like aren't optimized today that might give you kind of a runway of growth in those brands that are maybe similar to what you saw in beer over the last couple of years? William Newlands : Sure. You bet. We are doing a lot of analytical work around what is the best way to present our brands to the public. As an example, much like we have done in beer on space assessment, we're doing the same kind of space assessment work in our wine business as to whether or not more facings are better than something else, as an example. So we do believe that there is interesting and significant upside for that set of brands. They first of all, they're growing brands, they participate in growing categories, and we're going to support those and many of them with consumer advertising, at the same time, while we are increasing our analytical capability to leverage things like you note, which is where do we focus our incremental time and attention of our distributors and our sales organization, so that they maximize the potential for those brands. So the short answer is, yes. All of those things are being done and that should give us significant upside opportunity within our, the brands that are in the power sector of our business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey, good afternoon everybody. First one, just a quick one, how severe your 6.6% depletions came from your new products collectively? And then the second question, on the wine deal, is it structured as all or none, or are you able to carve out certain brands and effectively you have to keep them if it ends up going that route? And the reason why I ask is, if you look at the market shares at certain price points turns that they, they can be quite high, and so as we go through this kind of second request in information process, and curious if you have to sell the whole thing, or if you have the options to sell pieces of it or not? William Newlands : Go ahead, David. David Klein : Yes. So Kaumil, I'll start on that one. Look, we remain committed to the transaction that we've agreed to with Gallo, we're working our way through the FTC process, and we expect that we'll reach a successful conclusion. We've also stated for clarity that while we've extended our guidance through the end of Q2, we want to be clear that as stated in the 8-K, when we announced the additional work that we needed to do with the FTC that we would close, we expected the transaction to close in the second half of the year. So we'll provide a little more clarity, when as we get closer to a final resolution. William Newlands : And as to your piece of your question about the depletion growth obviously with 17% growth in Modelo Especial and the sheer size of that business that was actually the single biggest driver of our depletion growth profile coupled with double-digit growth in both Corona Premier and Pacifico. So \u2013 and at this point, we view Corona Premier as part of the franchise. We don't necessarily view that as a \"new product\" at this point. Obviously, Refresca had some benefit during the quarter, but it was relatively minimal compared to the sheer growth that existed on those mega brands of Modelo and the Corona Premier/Pacifico groups. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hi. Good morning, everyone. William Newlands : Good morning. Amit Sharma : Bill, can you talk about your on-premise trends for the beer business? I mean, lots of us focus on the IRI data and that data showed your depletions maybe a little bit weaker than where you came out to be. Is that the run rate going forward or should we think about that? And then on innovation, the question is as you focus on the Seltzer side of the business, do you believe you have the brand extensions already in the marketplace to go into that category? Or would you like to extend one of your brands as you think about the Seltzer category going forward? William Newlands : Sure. Let me start with your question about on-premise. On our on-premise business, we see as being up mid single-digits for our overall beer portfolio compared to an industry that's probably off low-single digits. So we certainly are outperforming and as I think, I noted in my original remarks that we're seeing an excellent uptick of 20% plus in Modelo draft as an example, which obviously occurs entirely through the on-premise arena. Our focus admittedly as I have said, we are watching Seltzer category very carefully. But I'll also say this. Our Refresca business is where we are focusing our attention this year. We think it's critically important when you introduce a new product and a new brand that you put the intensity of focus on that to get that into the mouths of consumers who are interested. And as I said earlier, as good as they are getting it into their mouths is a critically important element because they are just delicious. So our focus and intention is entirely around Refresca for this season, but as we said earlier, we will continue to explore all options where we can profitably participate in all of the areas of the business where we think it makes sense for us to do so. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you. So hi, Bill and David, and Patty. William Newlands : Hi. Andrea Teixeira : How are you? I just wanted to go back to the comment on the Corona family leaving the quarter and the one less day in the Corona family, we are accelerating in the most recent read from depletion standpoint, I appreciate our comment. But removing the noise from the inventories the one less day, if you think of the final consumer demand all channels, including the commentary that you gave on the on-premise, do you think the family can go back to that sweet spot and re-accelerate from flat to low single and or even mid single-digits from a consumer takeaway standpoint? I know you're comparing the plus 8 that you had last year from the plus 4 to the plus 8. But just to give us some perspective of the final demand and how we can put everything together all channels? William Newlands : Yes. We expect that the Corona family is going to have a very solid year with growth across the family, and again I would include the entire family. That would be Corona Extra. That would include Premier, Familiar etc. So we are continuing to expect that that business will perform well as you know. Our advertising has been increased against the Corona franchise for this year. Well, while many others actually are doing the opposite. So our share of voice within the beer category will be up during this summer selling season and we are very optimistic that Corona is going to be an important part of our growth profile acknowledging that we are 30 years and counting on our double-digit growth with Modelo and we're off to an amazing start this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open. Timothy Ramey : Maybe a quick one and then a different one. Any early thoughts on CapEx for 2021 and the wine in cans initiative is really interesting. It's been a super hot growth category. Any expectations on what that might look like? David Klein : Yes. So I'll hit the CapEx question. Yes, if we look at our CapEx over a three year horizon. So FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022, we expect that will be a net $700 million to $900 million range and we're headed toward that and that's inclusive of $200 million to $400 million of kind of maintenance CapEx within our business. So I think, even though this year's guidance is $800 million to $900 million total CapEx, which is going to be in that range for the next couple of years. William Newlands : And relative to the question around the wine in a can, as I commented in my previous remarks, our Crafters Union brand, which we are very excited about is it was part of our tying with the NFL and we think it's a great format. We're also looking at the idea of other can opportunities. I'll give you an example. Kim Crawford. We're looking at single serve Kim Crawford in a can as well. It is a great packaged for on-the-go and for certainly summer events and it seems like the consumer based on our research, the consumers are comfortable with a can format for wine. And therefore, we will participate with the brands that we feel are appropriate and where there is going to be real consumer demand within our portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Powers : Hey, great, thanks. A follow-up on your guidance, I guess, question is for David. I understand that the puts and takes that you ran through specific to the year and the quarter. But just stepping back at the risk of your loss in the numbers, if I take what you've said at the midpoint, so beer profits up 8% after 19 days, wine profits down say 27.5%, $430 million for interest expense. And then I add $30 million or so for Opus take away $200 million or so for corporate costs and tax effected out 17%, but the math that I'm running through just seems to point to something closer to like $9.20 in EPS, $9.20 so well above your current range. So just \u2013 am I missing something either in the math or in my logic or just can you bridge that gap for me, thanks? David Klein : Yes, I think it comes back to the things I pointed out earlier, Steve, which is really the, we take our previous guidance. We add one quarter of wine EBIT for the brands that are going to be sold. And there are a couple of things to consider with that. First of all, those brands and we put it in our earnings release, their performance last year, those brands are declining. There are stranded costs that we won't be able to take out because we used to have nine months to take cost out of the business, we will now have six months to take cost out of the business. So the incremental and we have the incremental interest expense on that. So I think when you factor all of those in, our guidance range makes sense. Maybe one other thing to think through is that, if you look at last year's numbers, I think we were in the maybe $20 million-ish of NCI, the NCI number is going to be in the $30 million to $40 million range. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open. Sean King : Hi guys, good morning. I apologize if I missed this one, but are you holding to your full-year expectation for Premier Growth? I know that with the track channels decelerating somewhat, but or is that more sort of offset by the accelerating strength in Modelo Especial? William Newlands : I'm not sure if it's yes or no. The answer is, we're expecting that it will be the previously expected growth profile. We're very pleased with the start the Premier is off to, and as David alluded to a little bit before we are seeing accelerating velocities against the Premier franchise. So yes, we're comfortable with where we expect that to go. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning, everyone. William Newlands : Hi, Laurent. Laurent Grandet : Two quick questions, so one on spirit guidance. So in a previous communication after the 4Q, you guided Wine and Spirits organic sales growth between low single-digit and mid single-digits, and high single-digit organic operating income growth. So you are not providing any more, any guidance this quarter. So how should we read this? And my second question is about Refresca, I mean I know it's still very early on. But could you share any feedback you are receiving from wholesalers, retailers and maybe having, the first I mean trying this with consumers. So that would be very helpful. Thank you. William Newlands : Yes, so what you're referring to, I think is inorganic sort of guidance for Wine and Spirits. And so we would expect that to be flat to slightly down. Now both topline and bottom line based upon the incremental quarter. And relative to your question on Refresca, it's early days and it's always dangerous to make too many projections on 30 days worth of selling. With that said, we are very pleased with where our ACV distribution has gotten to after the first month. And we've noticed that the variety pack has been particularly successful in the early days. Now whether or not that continues, I think it remains to be seen. It could very well be consumer sampling and deciding, which of those they happen to prefer, but certainly the early response in the variety pack has been \u2013 has exceeded our expectations. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Chappell : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to Woodbridge, and just trying to understand with a sub $10 brand, which is still part of the portfolio, and your kind of thoughts of these \u2013 the power wine and spirits brands growing at a much faster rate both next year and going forward. Just trying to couple that with what you've seen in the category for that kind of price points and with the competition in up years and down years, how confident, I mean that Woodbridge doesn't pull that growth down or that it can actually contribute as part of that? David Klein : Yes. So we've said in the past that when you look at our portfolio, Woodbridge is required for us to, we feel retain appropriate critical mass in our production facilities and with \u2013 and to retained clout with retailers. And as a result, we needed in our portfolio, understanding that just the category plays in, even if it continues to grow share in its category, it will be a drag on the total portfolio, and it's about Woodbridge represents about one-third of the remaining business kind of post sale. But we think this is a very important brand for our portfolio. And Jim Sabia and Robert Hanson are very focused on driving this brand's growth, and as evidenced by the new spots that we're seeing come onto TV over the last week, because we need this brand to be healthy, and we think that we can get some outsized share growth in its category. And at the same time, be able to give ourselves a little bit of pricing power with the brand. So we feel a lot of upside to Woodbridge and we're pretty excited about having it as part of our power brand portfolio. William Newlands : And Bill the other thing that I would purely add is keep in mind the 15 which is the larger size, no pun intended. It's the larger size within the portfolio sells for $12.99. So it gets into a plus $10 price point, when the consumer is pulling out their wallet to pay for our brands. So I echo what David said is Woodbridge has done an excellent job of outperforming the category in which it competes, and with the additional support and investment that we're going to make against it, we expect that that will continue to and be an important piece of our remain co as we go forward. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to William Newlands for closing remarks. William Newlands : Thanks very much, Daniel. So thank you all for joining our call today. The excellent start to fiscal 2020 has nicely positioned our business for another very successful year. The summer selling season is now in full swing, and our team plans to capitalize on the momentum we have underway, as we are well positioned with outstanding advertising and marketing initiatives across our entire portfolio. And as July 4, holiday is just around the corner, I hope your responsible celebrations with family and friends will include our fantastic beer, wine and spirit products. So thanks again everyone for joining the call and have a great summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Joelle. Good morning and welcome to Constellation\u2019s second quarter 2020 conference call. I am here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here is Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s second quarter sales and earnings results. We delivered an excellent quarter driven by strong performance of our beer business. And while our wine and spirits portfolio continues to be impacted by transition activities related to the Gallo transaction, I am pleased with the pace of progress and the strategic transformation of this business. Now that we are at the halfway point in the year, I would like you to focus on two key points as the second half of the year unfolds. Number one, Constellation and Gallo are working in full cooperation with the FTC, while they continue to review our wine and spirits deal. We are confident in our ability to close the transaction, which we now expect will occur by fiscal year-end 2020. For now, we have updated our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to assume that we close at the end of the third quarter, but we will adjust accordingly as we get more clarity on exact timing. Meanwhile, we are fully committed to supporting our entire portfolio throughout the transition. Number two, during the second quarter, Constellation\u2019s beer business remained the number one market share leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, representing 25% of high-end growth with Constellation growing share in every summer holiday. This is the 38th consecutive quarter of growth for our beer business and I remain confident in the prospects for this collection of iconic consumer-loved brands well into the future. Why are David and I so confident? Several reasons, high-end trade-up is a continuing trend for the entire U.S. total beverage alcohol market. Premiumization is becoming more prevalent in U.S. middle market states like Ohio and Michigan, where a significant amount of beer consumption occurs. Legal drinking age Hispanic population growth is expected to continue at a CAGR of roughly 3%. We have ample distribution runway with traction from key initiatives like shopper first shelf, which is a compelling opportunity for our retail partners. We have significant opportunities to increase household penetration with key brands and our beer innovation pipeline is strong and will continue to complement the other growth opportunities we have for the portfolio. As most of you know, the Modelo and Corona brand families are the powerhouse brands that represent the foundation of our business. So, let\u2019s drill down and discuss some details of the opportunities we have for specific brands within these brand families. Let\u2019s start with Modelo Especial, which generated the most dollar sales growth in the entire U.S. beer category during the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to [indiscernible] and recently achieved a significant new milestone becoming the number one import beer and the number five overall beer in the U.S. beer market. Modelo Especial alone contributed almost 30% of the total category growth during the second quarter with double-digit depletion growth in 44 out of 50 states. Modelo is growing with non-Hispanic acculturated Hispanic and multicultural consumers, and there remains significant upside to grow both penetration and by rate with these consumers. As a matter of fact, in calendar 2018, we estimate that only 5% to 6% of non-Hispanic beer consuming households drank Modelo Especial. For reference, that\u2019s roughly half the penetration that Corona Extra has in non-Hispanic beer households. Because Modelo has great growth momentum and excellent velocity, it should command more shelf space at retail compared to other top beer brands. And then the on-premise, Modelo Especial currently has distribution in just over 50% of the accounts that carry Corona Extra. We have already had excellent success this year with the launches of Modelo Especial 32-ounce bottles, Modelo Chelada Limon y Sal, and Modelo Negra 24-ounce cans. Bottom line, we have significant runway for growth with this brand well into the future. Now moving on to Corona, which is the number one high-end brand family in the U.S. beer market. This spring, the Corona brand family grew shelf space at retail almost 15%. One of the key drivers of this trend was Corona Premier, which experienced accelerating depletion growth throughout the summer months, while posting double-digit sales and distribution trends in IRI channels during the quarter. With our increased focus on Corona Premier in the on-premise this summer, it has become the fastest growing beer in this channel, a key channel to drive consumer trial. Corona Refresca has quickly become a top five share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer category with the Refresca variety pack becoming the number three new item in IRI channels during the second quarter based on dollar sales. Interestingly, Corona Refresca has higher velocity trends that one of its key competitors in this space, the Mike\u2019s brand family. We are very excited to announce that our new seltzer launch planned for next spring will be the next big innovation for the Corona brand family. Now, admittedly, this has been one of the worst kept secrets. But as you all know, Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers age 21 to 54, and that\u2019s why we have decided to put the Corona brand name on our new seltzer. And of course, the refreshment characteristics of seltzers perfectly match Corona refreshment DNA. We believe that seltzers are here to stay and will therefore accelerate the volume shift into category from the low-end to the high-end, where we are the market share leader. Corona hard seltzer will be introduced in four flavors, including tropical lime, mango, cherry, and blackberry lime. The brand will weigh in at 90 calories with the 4.5 ABV with zero carbs and zero sugars. So, let\u2019s now move on to Corona Extra, which is the number six beer brand in the U.S. market and boast velocity trends that are 2x the entire category. There continues to be runway for future Corona Extra growth with the incremental contributions coming from draft and can formats as well as the Coronita product, and we plan to increase our marketing investments throughout the remainder of our fiscal year for this brand. Last, but certainly not least, Pacifico produced double-digit depletion growth this past quarter driven by the national advertising campaign and retail promotions as we will continue to support the independent spirit of this brand with the Live Life Anchors Up marketing campaign. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunities to grow the beer business through a combination of enhanced distribution, innovation, and executional opportunities across the portfolio for years to come. Considering these factors, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales and EBIT growth for our beer business in fiscal \u201820 and beyond. Moving now to wine and spirits, as I mentioned, we continue to work with the FTC to finalize our wine and spirits transaction with Gallo. Meanwhile, business performance continues to be impacted by transition activities with distributors who have begun to reposition their portfolios for the change in ownership of brands upon the close of the pending transaction. In addition, we are overlapping a very strong second quarter last year. At that time, we executed select promotional activities for key power brands that we didn\u2019t repeat this year as they did not meet the returns and the target returns for the business. Why you might ask? The wine and spirits business transformation strategy is evolving under a new set of strategic imperatives that have a higher return target for these types of promotional activities based on a more disciplined revenue modeling tools that we have implemented similar to what we do in beer. While our year-to-date depletion trends for our power brands are flat, we are confident in our ability to deliver depletion growth for this portfolio of brands in the mid single-digit range for fiscal \u201820 and September has reflected that expectation. We are also pleased with the consumer takeaway trends for the power brands, which grew dollar sales 6% in IRI channels during the quarter, outperforming total U.S. wine growth of 3%. This demonstrates that the brands that will fuel our growth going forward have significant consumer-led momentum, which we believe will continue in the second half. What are the reasons to believe? As I mentioned, we are experiencing strong consumer takeaway trends for these power brands. In addition, we have an impactful innovation pipeline primed with new products launching for the key holiday selling season which begins this month. We are especially excited about our wine in a can launches, which we will capitalize on one of the fastest growing trends in the U.S. wine industry. We believe that our can format is the most attractive in this segment in terms of both taste and appearance and we have a successful proof point with Crafters Union, which was our inaugural launch of wine in a can earlier this year. It has since become the number one growth brand in canned wine and a top 5 share gainer in the super premium price segment. In addition to launching the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S. that being Kim Crawford in a can format, we will also introduce Kim Crawford Ros\u00e9 cans, that being the fastest growing SKU in this format. And we will not only plan to launch Woodbridge wine in a can, but in a tetra-pack format as well. In addition to our efforts in cans in tetra, the Robert Mondavi Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay is slotted for release this fall as well as the Rye Barrel Aged Red Blend, which was recently introduced into the market. As you would expect, we will continue to support our innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. On the spirits front, SVEDKA Vodka continue to post robust consumer takeaway sales growth trends of 6% in IRI channels during the quarter bolstered by our marketing campaign Bring Your Own Spirit. SVEDKA Ros\u00e9 continues to outpace our expectations, while the core offerings in the portfolio remain extremely healthy as well. Our American whiskey High West has been growing double-digits in IRI for the 3 years that we have owned the brand. Driven by an award-winning taste, brand authenticity and strong distribution gains, we continue to expect High West to remain a solid growth contributor to our portfolio going forward. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to sell Black Velvet Canadian Whisky to Heaven Hill for $266 million. This action aligns with our consumer-led premiumization strategy to deliver accelerated growth as we continue to execute the transformation strategy for our business. Our ventures team was quite active during the quarter as we made two new minority investments. The first is Montanya Distillers, a Colorado-based award-winning American craft rum maker. Montanya\u2019s rums are currently distributed in more than 40 states and 7 countries overseas and can be purchased online. The second is Durham Distillery, a craft gin, vodka, liqueur and ready-to-drink canned cocktail producer that was recently recognized as the number one craft gin distillery in the U.S. by USA Today. Additionally, Durham has earned more than 50 national and international awards. Both these investments are part of our Female Founders initiative which makes meaningful investments in female-led businesses doing disruptive and innovative work across beverage alcohol. Overall, we will continue to maintain our focus on premiumization, innovation and brand building as the transformation strategy evolves for our wine and spirit business. Now, a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales. During the quarter, Canopy Growth and Acreage Holdings received overwhelming shareholder approval for the agreement that grants Canopy the right to acquire Acreage and enter the U.S. cannabis market once federally permissible. As you know, this opportunity provides the path for Canopy to have a leading position in the U.S. upon federal cannabis reform. And speaking of that reform, I was excited to see that the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the SAFE Act by a wide majority. While this bill also need Senate approval, it would deliver access to traditional banking services for thousands of legal cannabis businesses in the U.S. and shows positive momentum in the legalization debate moving forward. We are also looking forward to the launch of Rec 2.0 in Canada when Canopy will unveil their portfolio of value-added higher margin products in various form factors, including drinks, edibles and bake. In the U.S., the Canopy team has been actively developing a range of high-quality CBD products and related marketing plans as well as securing the production resources necessary to bring these products to the U.S. market by the end of their fiscal year. New CBD product offerings include skincare and cosmetics, therapeutic creams, beverages, edibles, oils and softgels. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they have done in the last few months. In closing, I am extremely pleased with the progress of our business at the halfway mark in the year. Our beer business continues to deliver industry leading results and our wine and spirits business is successfully executing their transformation strategy. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders with the share repurchases we made during the second quarter and I am bullish about our prospects across the business for the remainder of this year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the second quarter. David Klein : Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. In Q2, we continue to produce strong beer operating performance and we delivered superior cash flow results. Our wine business delivered results in line with our expectations as we execute this transition year. Share repurchases during the quarter reflect confidence in our ability to produce top tier growth well into the future and our commitment to generate returns for shareholders. We have increased and narrowed our full year comparable basis diluted EPS range to $9 through $9.20. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. Our increased guidance now assumes the transaction with Gallo closes at the end of Q3 and the divestiture of Black Velvet Canadian Whisky closes on November 1. Now, let\u2019s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results starting with beer. Net sales increased 7% on volume growth of 5%. The reversal of the shipment timing benefit in Q2 was less than expected. This helped Q2 net sales coming ahead of our mid single-digit growth guidance, which we provided last quarter. Depletion growth showed continued strength at more than 6%. When adjusted for 1 less selling day in the quarter, the business generated 7.5% depletion growth, reflecting accelerating trends for some of our key brands during the summer selling season. We expect this acceleration to continue into the second half of the year when we are no longer of lapping the Corona Premier and Familiar launches. As a note, in Q3, selling days are flat year-over-year. Beer operating margin increased 50 basis points to a record 41.8%. Benefits from pricing in foreign currency were partially offset by higher COGS. The higher COGS primarily reflect materials inflation mostly driven by contractual increases in glass and cartons. I am pleased with the success of our first half productivity initiatives. These productivity savings were achieved earlier in the year than originally anticipated and helped us offset other cost inflation headwinds in the business. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points to 9.1%. Marketing spend came in lower than planned as we revised the cadence in magnitude of marketing spend for the year, which I will discuss in a minute. For fiscal \u201820, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 7% to 9%. This includes 1 to 2 percentage points of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. We now expect our full year operating margin to be flattish compared to the prior year result of 39.3%, which is an improvement compared to our original guidance of 39%. We continue to expect our gross margin to be flattish for the year as cost inflation headwinds and growth investments are expected to being mostly offset by product pricing and productivity initiatives. Some of the cost headwinds that we originally projected are not materializing to the levels we anticipated. However, operating margin will be impacted in the back half by the reversal of the remaining shipment timing benefit from fiscal \u201819 and our implementation of SAP S/4 HANA ERP system in Mexico. In addition, we now expect fiscal \u201820 marketing as a percent of net sales to be closer to the top of our 9.5% to 10% range. We believe it\u2019s prudent to reinvest some of the margin upside from our first half success to support our brands in the second half. Our increased investment will mostly focus on the Corona brand family. As mentioned earlier, the shipment timing benefit at the end of fiscal \u201819 partially reversed in Q2. We expect the remaining shipment timing benefit to reverse in Q3. Over the last 2 years, Q3 has been our lowest margin quarter primarily driven by lower seasonal plant throughput and marketing investments. We expect Q3 marketing as a percent of net sales to be greater than 11%. As a result of these factors, we expect Q3 operating margin to be just over 36%. Moving to wine and spirits, net sales declined 9% and shipments down 10%, depletions declined 13%. These trends were largely driven by our lower end brands and transition activities associated with the transaction. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 330 basis points to 22.8%. This decline was primarily driven by higher COGS and marketing investment. Higher COGS primarily reflect freight cost headwinds, lower volume throughput and increased transportation costs. We now expect fiscal \u201820 wine and spirits net sales to decline 15% to 20% and operating income to decline approximately 25%. Our revised guidance reflects the transaction close assumptions discussed earlier. As a result of the Q3 close guidance assumption for the wine and spirits transaction, we now expect our fiscal \u201820 stranded cost removal to approximate $20 million compared to the $35 million to $55 million previously disclosed. However, we remain committed to the total stranded cost removal of approximately $130 million by the end of fiscal \u201821. I remain confident that the wine and spirits transformation strategy is working. Power brand performance continues to benefit from our increased focus in marketing investments, which is reflected in the solid consumer takeaway trends for these brands in IRI channels. In fiscal \u201820, we continue to target mid single-digit power brand depletion growth. Longer term, we expect the business to produce mid single-digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. As we work through the process to close the transaction with Gallo, the business continues to be impacted by transition activities. Therefore, we expect Q3 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT to decline 15% to 20%. To finalize this discussion, I have one other point to note. We now believe it\u2019s likely that a portion of the wine and spirits transaction purchase price will be in the form of contingent consideration based on future performance of the brands targeted for sale. Accounting rules govern our election to record the contingent consideration when it\u2019s determined to be realizable. Therefore, in the third quarter, we expect to recognize the loss of up to $300 million on the write-down of the assets held-for-sale. Now, let\u2019s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expense came in at $97 million. We expect full year corporate expense to approximate $215 million reflecting a second half ramp in IT spend, which includes our SAP S/4 HANA implementation. In Q2, interest expense increased 27%. This reflects interest expense of approximately $39 million related to the funding for our incremental Canopy Growth investment in November of 2018. Fiscal \u201820 interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million. This reflects incremental interest due to the wine and spirits transaction timing. Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, including Canopy equity earnings, came in at 13.9% versus 18.4% last year. The decrease reflects a lower rate on foreign earnings and higher stock-based compensation benefits. Our fiscal year-to-date comparable basis tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings is 16.8%. We continue to forecast our full year fiscal \u201820 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, to approximate 17%. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the first half of fiscal \u201820. This represents an impressive 10% increase. Free cash flow improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. The lower CapEx is primarily due to timing. We continue to expect full year CapEx spend of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries as well as the fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. We now expect fiscal \u201820 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This increase reflects an additional quarter of EBIT from the wine and spirits brands targeted for sale as well as cash tax benefits. Shifting to our investment in Canopy Growth, the total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $757 million. In Q2, we recognized a $1.2 billion gain on our modified Canopy warrants partially offset by approximately $400 million of loss in equity and earnings, which reflects CBI share of additional loss on the modification. This net gain resulted from shareholder approval of Canopy Growth\u2019s proposed acquisition of Acreage and was more than offset by the decrease in fair value of Canopy investments for the quarter. These impacts were excluded from comparable basis results. As summarized in the earnings release, second quarter fiscal \u201820 comparable basis diluted EPS, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, totaled $2.91 per share. Canopy\u2019s business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they continue to focus on their path to profitability. I would like to remind everyone, Canopy equity earnings recognized in our income statement are non-cash and we have not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal \u201820 comparable basis EPS guidance range of $9 to $9.20. This allows us and our investors to focus on the performance of our core business. In July, we issued $800 million of senior notes at an attractive fixed rate and used the proceeds to redeem higher interest rate debt. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making toward our de-leveraging goals, excluding Canopy equity earnings. In fact, we\u2019ve reduced our net debt level by more than $650 million since the end of fiscal \u201819. This allowed us to opportunistically repurchase $50 million worth of stock during the quarter. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate, we are committed to returning $4.5 billion to shareholders from fiscal \u201820 through fiscal \u201822. The share repurchases we\u2019ve made during the quarter reflect the confidence we have in our long-term business model. We believe our combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects creates a best-in-class opportunity within the CPG space. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hi. So I guess, my question is, given the pipeline of innovation that you will have going into next year and kind of the spending levels that you had this year behind the beer business, this is to support the innovation and initiatives yet this year, is that 10% or so of revenue still a good sort of basis baseline to use in terms of marketing investment to support the business going forward or if innovation is going to step up or will it potentially have to step up more? David Klein : Bryan, we\u2019re still in the process of finalizing our - all of our spend plans for next year, but we do expect it to be consistent with the range that we\u2019ve done in this fiscal year, so somewhere in that 9% to 10% range. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hey, how are you? Can you talk a little bit about the contribution from some of these innovations over the last couple of years to your depletions at the moment, and then maybe if you want to give some insight on how you expect it to contribute going forward? Bill Newlands : Certainly, the Premier introduction has been everything we expected. It\u2019s appeal to a new consumer sub-segment, which is those individuals who are looking for a low-carb offering. And as we noted, we continue to see acceleration, particularly in the on-premise during this quarter. So, we\u2019re very pleased with that. We\u2019ve seen the addition of the bottle format for Familiar, the smaller bottle format has been very good for us as well. As David noted, we overlapped all of those early introductions during this quarter, which I think shows the strength of our overall beer business with our depletion growth on a days adjusted basis of roughly 7.5%. It\u2019s pretty powerful given the lapping that we had from last year of those two introductions. You then add Refresca, which has exceeded our expectations as well. As I noted in my script, the velocity of that is better than one of our key competitors in the FMB space, [indiscernible] and we expect strong things from that in the future as well. It shows that the strength of the Corona franchise and its refreshment DNA that we are able to extend that brand into other sub-categories. David Klein : Yes. And I would add to that Kaumil that in our algorithm, we say that we\u2019re going to grow net sales in our beer business high-single digits over the next few years, and 25% of that growth is really made up of innovation, and clearly that includes Premier and the new Corona seltzer that we\u2019re talking about. The other thing I just want to point out to as it relates to our overall growth in the business, we called out the last sell day in Q2, which really drives our depletion growth to that 7.5% range. That has us continuing to grow significant share in the beer business, and a big driver of that is the innovation work within the beer business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Bill Newlands : Hello. Kevin Grundy : Question, Bill, on the spiked seltzer rollout for next year, so a handful of questions all related to that, based on your internal models, how big do you think the category can become over, say the next 3 to 5 years? How are you defining success for the Corona spike seltzer rollout? And then, how do you think this product is differentiated in what is a fairly undifferentiated product category at this point. The ABV calories and sugar content all sounded pretty similar to the existing brands, of course pace will be paramount, but any comments you have there would be helpful? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. I think that\u2019s an evolving answer. I think, everyone has been somewhat surprised by the aggressive growth that we\u2019ve seen in the seltzer business, particularly over the course of this selling season. What I would say is this. I think Corona brings a unique refreshment profile to this particular category. We would expect to gain a significant amount of share in the high-end as we have with anything else that we introduce amongst our franchises relative to the product. I would look very carefully at what we said. This is a zero carb, zero sugar product. I don\u2019t think you will find that with any of the other products that have been introduced into the market. And I\u2019d add one more point. We said on our prior quarter discussions that we would not be entering this category unless we felt we could do it with a superior product with superior margin and profitability structure. I can assure you that this will be a superior product with superior margin and profitability structure versus other competitors in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Bill Kirk : Hey, thank you for taking the question. So just one for me on the transition of the divested wine brands, it seems you are saying the loss cases have had negative growth is the result of distributors maybe not giving those brands as much attention since they may be leaving their houses. One, is that fair? And two, is there an additional aspect of maybe you are not putting as many trade dollars or putting as much spending into those brands since they are leaving your system? David Klein : Yes. So Bill, look, we continue to support the brands, but when distributors understand that Brands won\u2019t be in their house, as you said, it\u2019s difficult to get them to continue to drive the brands the way we would like them to. In general, to switch back to our portfolio, we have called out full year depletions for our power brands of mid-single digits. Year-to-date, we\u2019re below that, but we remain confident that we\u2019ll get to that number over the course of the year as a result of the more disciplined execution strategy that Bill talked about in his comments. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. So, I was just hoping to be able to kind of reconcile. I know there is definitely a difference between the track channel and obviously what you deplete. But obviously when you when you still look at, so I was just hoping to see if you can reconcile some of the comments on the on-premise and off-premise and granted that you\u2019ve been making a lot of inroads on the on-premise, on cans and also on draft. So I was hoping to see if you\u2019re saying, obviously as the track channels skew more into California where you are, and then always going to trail your numbers, but if you can clarify, I think it would be helpful for investors. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yes. So, Andrea, thank you for that question, because we normally operate with a 200 to 300 basis point disconnect between depletions \u2013 our depletions and IRI. Meaning, our depletions run lower than IRI. When you adjust for the sell day and remember that the market data, the IRI data is just 12 rolling weeks. We are back within that 200 to 300 basis point delta, right. So there is not really a disconnect. It\u2019s any more unusual than we normally experienced. So then when you look at individual channel, when we look at the on-premise in aggregate, we continue to grow share in the on-premise being up, we were up in the quarter low single-digits. I think the industry was down low-single digits or somewhere in that area. So, we continue to perform well across all channels for our beer business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hey, good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Amit Sharma : Just two clarifications. One, Bill, you talked about South having a superior margin to competitors, is it also superior to your beer margins as you think about it? And then, the second \u2013 for David, so if there\u2019s 200 to 300 basis point delta to IRI is the right metric I mean IRI trends show pretty meaningful acceleration in August and September. So what does it say about Q3 depletions certainly going to be at least looking back at the data, much stronger than what you did in Q2? Bill Newlands : Yes. So, I think, to take the first question, we expect all up all into be over time when we\u2019re fully yet scale production in seltzer that we will deliver kind of a similar margin case to the one that we have for the rest of our beer business. And we without really commenting on September depletions, we expect our depletions as I said in my comments to continue to accelerate as we go through the year and we\u2019re past to the launch of last year of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is now open. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : I had two quick \u2013 good morning, two quick questions. Bill, have you guys tested the seltzer concept yet? I mean I know you\u2019ve already go this pretty fast in terms of the turnaround here, but just curious if you have any things you can share with us on the test market. And then, the bigger picture question is, on the wine and spirits transaction with Gallo, I mean, is \u2013 can this deal be revised? Is there a potential to realize more value from some of the brand, but maybe the FTC is looking at with other buyers. I mean, any context around that would be helpful? Bill Newlands : Sure. Relative to the question of testing, we obviously have not done a market test. But we, as we always do, when we introduce any new product, we do a battery of consumer testing around it to make sure that we both have the right look. And by that I mean packaging that we have the right flavor profiles that will perform at our better than the competition. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think this product is going to be a demonstrable winner in the category or we wouldn\u2019t have launched it. David, do you want to answer the other? David Klein : Yes. So, Nik, we remain confident that the Gallo transaction will get done. We need to work our way through the process to see kind of the final form that it takes. As I called out in my script, and you\u2019ll see in the Q, we will recognize in the third quarter of $300 million loss on part of the dispositions that right and what I mean by that is we have a set of brands including the Gallo brands that we listed out and the Black Velvet brand that we\u2019ve also talked about that. We\u2019re disposing of as a result of the wine transformation that we\u2019re going through, and we\u2019re pretty confident that when we\u2019re done with all of the work that\u2019s required around that portfolio that we\u2019re dealing with that, we\u2019ll end up with neither a loss nor a gain will end up with about a push in that regard. And then, we\u2019ll have our business really well positioned to focus on the high end of the industry and a portfolio that can grow mid-single digits and deliver 30% operating margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open. Rob Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much and my apologies. But, some \u2013 a few more questions on Corona seltzer, tried the product in Atlanta yesterday, it\u2019s a great product, very exciting. What are your thoughts on cannibalization both in terms of your beers and then also in terms of the category how accretive is it\u2019s in the beer category in your view as you kind of 50-50 cannibalizing beer 50 wine and spirits, are you thinking about it differently? And then finally, do you \u2013 are you set up for automated lines for the variety pack? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. Well, I\u2019m glad you liked it, will add you to our consumer panel next time, Robert. So, we like it as well. Here\u2019s what I would say. We expect that this to be heavily accretive to our overall beer franchise. Obviously the growth that we\u2019ve all seen in seltzers had some impact on our franchise and many other beer franchises during the summer months. But if \u2013 I will take you back to what we have done most recently, which is Premier and Familiar, both of which had more than 50% accretion to our overall brand portfolio, with Premier being closer to 75%. So, we would certainly expect that this is going to be very additive to our overall portfolio for the Corona brand franchise going forward, and a big factor is going to be just what you said. These are delicious tasting products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : Bill, you went through like bunch of stuff in all of the major brand franchises and trends. So when I was thinking about the depletion number, in total with Modelo growing as strongly as it is, they feel like it medium size of rest of the portfolio. In aggregate, it\u2019s sort of flattish. And I guess, is that reasonable and if so like what are the pieces we didn\u2019t really talk about today? Is Corona Extra, Corona Light, we expect you to cannibalize by Premier, but what are you seeing from Corona Extra? And as you think about stepping up spending from here, outside of the seltzer launch, what are the areas in particular that you\u2019re targeting on Corona to accelerate performance? What do you think you can do differently? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. We obviously are increasing our support for Corona Extra for the remainder of this fiscal year. And you are correct. Year-to-date, Corona Extra itself is roughly flattish. And there are some obvious interaction between Modelo, which is, as I noted on fire, and Corona. So we would expect a little bit of that movement within our own franchise, but overall the Corona brand family continues to grow. And a lot of that growth remains in things like Premier Refresca with continued strong performance with Corona Extra, given there is a lot of other family members now than there was not so long ago. Pacifico as I noted on the call was up double-digits in depletions during the quarter and we continue to be happy with the acceleration in that area. I realize, Robert \u2013 going back to Robert for just a second, I apologize I did not answer your second question about automation. We have an approach that we think is ready to go to create efficiencies within how you pack for a variety pack, which is I am sure the real answer to your question \u2013 the real question that you have in your mind. So, we are set up to do that within our current operation structure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open. Gerald Pascarelli : Hi. This is Gerald Pascarelli on for Vivien. Thanks very much for taking the question. Bill Newlands : Yes. You don\u2019t sound like Vivien. Gerald Pascarelli : So, Bill, mine is on Corona Refresca, just based on some of the share gain commentary that you offered, can you just provide us some color on where you believe you\u2019re sourcing share? And then, maybe some color on specific consumer demographic trends around the brand. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. We are still developing some of those answers. As you can imagine, we\u2019re still in the early stage. One of the things that we have noted is that the Hispanic demographic had been generally less aggressive in their adoption of FMBs, but because of their strong affiliation with the Corona franchise, we have noted a strong uptick with our strong demographic base the Hispanic community around Refresca. However, we are also seeing, as you can imagine, this product is largely shelved and largely placed in the cold box in a different place and competes much more with the FMB categories rather than competing with our core Corona offerings. So, we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019re broadening our audience and broadening our appeal to new use occasions with Refresca and are very bullish on the future for that sub-brand as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Dara Mohsenian : Yes, hey, guys. So, a follow-up question on Corona seltzer. I guess, can you help us understand why an existing beer brand, albeit one with incredible equity, and Corona is the right choice for a brand in the seltzer category, given it looks like hard seltzer is more of a distinct segment versus traditional beer. And a lot of the companies that have launched brands there have used new brand names instead of the traditional beer brands. So, maybe are you seeking what others is adding but help me understand why that\u2019s the right decision in your minds and what your consumer research is telling you. And then, the second, any concerns over a longer-term brand equity to the traditional Corona beer business from a hard seltzer launch and how do you guys think through that? Right? Bill Newlands : You bet. As you can imagine, we tested that question very, very deeply. The whole essence in the whole DNA of Corona is all around refreshment. I mean, when you discuss that across any of the sub-brands, that\u2019s the first thing that comes back in the consumers\u2019 mind is, this is a refreshing beer. It\u2019s a refreshing product no matter in which category falls \u2013 fall it fall similarly as a response to Refresca. One of the key elements that the consumer is looking for in seltzer is refreshment. Therefore, the match with that DNA is perfect, to go along with Corona\u2019s core DNA and why we felt that if we were going to enter this category, we would do it with a brand that had deep trust with the consumer. As we noted earlier, it is the number one trusted brand with Hispanics and non-Hispanics 21 to 54. Therefore, we believe this will be a very strong entry in the seltzer space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Bill Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Bill Newlands : Good morning, Bill. David Klein : Good morning. Bill Chappell : Follow-up on the wine business can you just give us a little more color on the distribution changes, and how that\u2019s \u2013 it sounds like there are some collateral damage at least in the near term to your existing brands from the divestiture, and so trying to understand if more color on that and then how you then going forward reduce the dissynergies, it would seem like you would need to continue to have a fair amount of spending behind their \u2013 personnel behind there to kind of keep their presence the same? Bill Newlands : We have focused our attention on continuing to deliver results against the entire business. There is no question that the transition that is occurring has been distracting to our distributors and to our internal population. With that said, we continue to remain excited by the power brand results of up 6% in IRI during the most recent quarter, and SVEDKA falls into the exact same number 6% growth during the most recent quarter as well. So, we remain very bullish that as we get this transaction completed that what will remain will be high-margin, high growth potential businesses and franchises and brands that are going to be a very strong consumer products play for a long time to come. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any further remarks. Bill Newlands : Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate your joining the call. And let me say, as we close out the discussion of our quarterly results, David and I are both pleased with the strong start to the first half of this year and we remain very bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. Please be sure to have a safe and happy holiday season and remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations with family and friends. Thanks again for coming on the call and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following the prepared remarks, we will -- the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks Liz. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's third quarter 2020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I certainly hope you enjoyed the holidays and have the opportunity to include some of our awesome Constellation products in your celebrations with your family and friends. The end of every year is a time of reflection for me, and this year is no exception. As I reflect on 2019 I'm reminded that we're not only ending a certain fiscal year but a dynamic decade the Constellation Brands. Since 2010 constellation has been on an incredible journey marked by strong financial performance and notable business milestones. Over the last 10 years, we've significantly increased the value of our stock and produced double-digit growth in sales, operating income and operating cash flow. As a matter of fact, the closing price of Constellation's stock on December 31, 2009 was just more of than $15. Fast forward to December 31, 2019 we closed at almost 190. This incredible increase of more than 1000% over the last 10 years made Constellation, the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index during this timeframe. One of the biggest drivers of our success with the game changing beer acquisition that was executed almost half way through the last decade. It enables Constellation to buy Grupo Modelo brands in the United States where we successfully built these brands for many years, while positioning ourselves for this transformational opportunity. At that time, this deal allowed us to double the sales of our company, diversify our profit stream, significantly enhance our margin, earnings and free cash flow while providing new avenues for growth. Since then, our beer business has made significant contribution to the overall sales, profit and cash flow results for our business and continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one Brewer and seller of imported beer in the US market. Calendar 2019 marked the 10th consecutive year of volume growth for Constellation Beer business and solidified our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer business. These trends were driven by Corona Extra, Modelo Especial's explosive growth and our successful innovation initiatives. In 2010, the Modelo Especial brand depleted approximately 35 million cases and then went on to achieve double-digit growth in every single year of the past decade finishing 2019 at more than a 140 million cases and there's more to come. In our most recent third quarter this powerhouse brand posted depletion growth of almost 15% with double-digit growth in 46 of the 50 states while solidifying its position as the number four beer brand in the US market. Corona Extra which is the number 7 beer brand in the US beer category grew from approximately 90 million cases in 2010 to more than a 110 million cases in 2019 and as one of the few top selling brands in the US to grow this past decade. From a quarterly perspective the Corona brand family grew nearly 7% in IRI channels, driven by the continued strength of our Corona Premier and Corona Refresca innovations as well as the renewed growth of Corona Extra. Corona Premier continues to gain distribution, especially in the on-premise and delivered double-digit depletion growth in 35 of the 50 states during the quarter. Corona Refresca was a top 10 growth contributor to the year -- to the US high-end beer category during the third quarter. And finally, let's not forget Pacifico which achieved double-digit depletion growth of nearly 16% and remained a top share gainer within the US imports segment. We're excited also about our plans for the launch of Corona Hard Seltzer this spring, which will help to further strengthen our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer segment. Our launch strategy includes the largest-ever single brand investment for our portfolio of more than 100 -- excuse me, more than 40 million in marketing to support this intro. We've already started to take orders from distributors and have received incredibly positive feedback from retailers who are excited about the prospects of Corona seltzer and have already incorporated our newest portfolio addition into their shelf set programing plans for the spring selling season. As we've discussed Corona hard seltzer will be introduced in four flavors, including tropical lime, mango, cherry and blackberry lime. Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54 and that's why we've decided to put the Corona brand name on our new seltzer and of course the refreshment characteristics of seltzers perfectly matches with Corona's refreshment DNA. There's been a lot of debate about the seltzer trend and where seltzers are sourcing their growth within the total beverage alcohol category. Our research shows that seltzer you is taking share across the board from beer, wine and spirits. While significant amount of this growth is sourced from the beer category it is primarily coming from domestic premiums, press and FMBs with minimal interaction of seltzer consumption with imported brands. In addition, we are seeing increased overall consumption from those seltzer drinkers and new consumers who are entering the TVA space through their interaction with seltzers. As the trends that you've seen for Constellation's beer business in this week's four week IRI data covering the month of December are related to our recent annual price increase specifically in the California market which briefly decreases features and promotions. The impact of these price increases are normal and frankly short term in nature. Overall we closed out the month With the depletion growth high single-digit range of our year-to-date trends. Moving now to wine and spirits. I'm pleased that we've been able to execute a revised agreement with Gallo which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. In addition, we believe it addresses the FTC concerns by excluding the sparkling wine brandy dessert wines and concentrate categories from the original transaction. We are already actively pursuing other opportunities to divest most if not all brands in these categories as we believe this is the best path to optimize our portfolio going forward. To be clear the FTC needs to provide final approval of our revised agreement with Gallo, once we have finalized all transactions, including the proposed divestitures, which we expect to occur by our fiscal year-end. We have also entered into a separate but related agreement with Gallo to divest our Nobilo Wine brand. This fits with Gallo portfolio strategy and allows them to expand in the New Zealand wine category without affecting our long-term goals and strategy or our opportunity in the New Zealand wine category in the US as a greater than $11 price point. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 21. Despite the delay and timing and revisions to the transaction I'd like to remind everyone that we have benefited from almost an entire year of additional cash flow from the divested brands by the time the transaction closes, which has contributed to our debt reduction and share buyback activities. During the last decade our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our wine and spirits portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of assets in an average premiumized business, which is the right strategy to enhance our lines for growth and financial profile going forward. This premiumization strategy is taking hold in the marketplace as our power brands continue to outpace our competitors and take market share at the price points that matter in the higher end. In fact, our power brands as the greater than $11 retail price point grew nearly 9% in IRI channels. During the third quarter including brands like which is more than doubled this volume with a CAGR of nearly 30% since its acquisition in 2015. Kim Crawford, which is another gem within our power brand portfolio Was the number one selling wine on wine.com this past year and has consistently outperformed its competitors, posting a 20% volume CAGR and IRI channels over the last decade. As we progress through fiscal 20 we continue to show steady upward progression in revenue trends for our power brands and expect mid-single digit sales growth for this collection of brands in the fourth quarter. Innovation and new product development are also critical to our success for the remainder of the year and we feel we are well positioned to drive these initiatives to the finish line. We've already had great success with the launch of Robert Mondavi, Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay and Woodbridge ready to drink packs, which while gaining traction across all channels is doing especially well in the convenience channel. A channel growing at two times the rate of the total US wine market. Both Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection which represent the most significant volume within the Robert Mondavi brand franchise are outperforming in their respective price segments driven by marketing investments that we've recently made. We recently extended our highly successful Barrel-Aged program with the introduction of our RMPS Rye Barrel Aged Red Blend. As a reminder, we've sold more than one million cases of barrel Lynch products since the inception of this program nearly two years ago, which helped to revive that Robert Mondavi Private Selection brand, will also becoming the foundation for some of our other successful Barrel Aged innovations like Cooper & Thief. We're also building on the success of wine in a can where consumers are seeking products that are convenient, ready to drink and sold an environmentally friendly packaging. These trends have helped to fuel the growth of Crafters Union, which is the number one growth driver in canned wine over the last 12 weeks. We plan to build on the momentum of this brand with the launch of Crafters Union Bubbles during the fourth quarter. Later this month, we will be releasing the prisoner Unshackled, the newest addition to The prisoner collection of brands in Red Blend and Rose. We expect these brands to strengthen our ability to compete at the fast growing $25 retail price point. On the spirits front SVEDKA Vodka continues to significantly outpace the Vodka the category in IRI channels, driven by increased distribution within a core portfolio as well as low as the more recent introduction of the Rosie flavor. During the quarter. One of our most successful venture investments. Nelson's Green Brier once launched its first Tennessee Whiskey product, this Tennessee Whiskey is based on Nelson's original recipe dating back to 1860 and it's the first time it's been bottled since provisions shut down at distillery in 1909. This is another milestone for Nelson's Green Brier as they continue to innovate and leverage the success they've already achieved. Overall, our US wine and spirits business has executed changes that have resulted in the sharpened focus on consumer preferred trends related to premiumization, innovation and brand building. As a result we have benefited from ongoing consumer trade of trends positive mix and great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace. Before moving on to Canopy Growth, I'd like to remind everyone that the core business activities I just highlighted are driving an increase in our EPS guidance for fiscal 20. Now a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to have the leading market share in Canada and to leave a leader in global cannabis sales. We've remained bullish on the Canadian cannabis market as the conversion of the illicit market to the legal market continues to strengthen. Per Statistics Canada in 2018%, 23% of cannabis consumers obtained cannabis from a legal market, while in 2019 that number significantly improved to almost 50%. In addition, retail store sales have increased significantly in every province during the last 12 months. We expect further retail sales increases as products, like vape, edibles and beverages flow through the retail stores in Canada now the Rec 2.0 products have been released. We couldn't be more excited to see these products in the marketplace as Canopy now have the ability to showcase their best in class brands and intellectual property. We are also excited to see the progress, the Ontario government has made to satisfy the demand of consumers by agreeing to allow more retail store openings beginning in early March. During Canopy's second quarter they established leading recreational market share across Canada, including a noteworthy share of over 35% in Alberta, Canada's most developed provincial recreational market. In the US in early December the Canopy team introduced first and freight allowing a branded CBD products. These products And a variety of formats including softgels, oil drops and creams and are currently available for sale via e-commerce on the first and free website. Overall, we're pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they've accomplished in the last few months. As most of you know, in less than a week, my colleague, David Klein will assume the role of CEO in Canopy Growth where I believe he will bring more focus and discipline to that business in executing their strategic priorities. We have also appointed as Constellation's new CFO who will help lead our company through its next phase of growth. David has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments and Constellation are numerous, and I wish him great success of Canopy where I will continue to collaborate with him through our Canopy board interactions. During this time the Constellation David built an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we're expecting a seamless transition as he assume his new role. Garth brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position. Most recently, serving as Senior Vice President for our corporate development activities, where he's led the company's efforts and financial planning reporting and analysis as well as mergers, acquisitions and our venture initiatives. Many of you will have the opportunity to meet Garth in the coming weeks and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. In closing we have accomplished a great deal on this exciting journey through the last decade. But I'm equally excited and optimistic about the next 10 years as well. We have a great product portfolio in a terrific industry, we have the right strategy and its energized management team in place to execute our vision for the future. I'd like to reiterate two key takeaways from today's discussion, number one, with every step we take we are positioning Constellation for sustained long-term success. As we continue to premiumize the portfolio the strategy, which has paid huge dividends over the years. I'm confident in the continuation of strong results for our beer business and the excellent prospects for our wine and spirits business going forward. Number two, our powerful cash generation capability and our desire to quickly de-lever and return 4.5 billion in cash to shareholders makes Constellation Compelling investment for the future. We remain steadfast in this commitment and I believe our significant debt reduction to date, coupled with our second quarter share repurchase are a testament to this commitment. We have a relentless consumer offset focus on brands and categories that are high growth, high margin and we're working continuously to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. We plan to execute in these areas throughout the remainder of the year and well into the coming decade. With that I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, David, who will review the financial results of our third quarter. David? David Klein : Good morning everyone and thank you, Bill. It's truly -- pleasure working with you and all of the wonderful people at Constellation. My time as CFO has been exciting, as well as personally and professionally fulfilling. On leaving the company in good hands with Garth as the new CFO throughout his 18 years at Constellation Garth has been a significant contributor to our premiumization and growth efforts while developing an in-depth understanding of the company's business operations and finance activities/. Going forward, we will continue to collaborate on key initiatives as they relate to Constellation's investment in Canopy Growth. I'll certainly miss my interactions with our investors and the sales side analysts who cover Constellation. Over the years I've valued your ideas suggestions and feedback and I thank you for your ongoing support. I look forward to continuing to interact with many of you in my new role at Canopy growth. Now moving to the financials in Q3, we continued to produce strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, our wine and spirits Power Brand strategy is gaining momentum as marketplace performance for these brands continues to outpace the overall category. We also recently closed the Black Velvet transaction revised the original Wine and Spirits deal with Gallo, including a separate but related agreement to divest the Nobilo Wine brand and signed an agreement with Brewing to divest Ballast Point. Before we jump into the financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance, we've increased and narrowed our full year comparable basis, diluted EPS range to $9.45 to $9.55. Our increased guidance range primarily reflects the updated Gallo transactions and related timing as well as strong beer operating performance. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings which better reflects the Underlying performance of our core business. We strongly urge investors to focus on this metric as the Canopy equity earnings impact is non-cash. Our increased FY20 guidance now assumes the Revised Wine and Spirits transactions and the Ballast Point transaction closed by the end of the fiscal 20. We expect the Nobilo transactions to close in the first half of fiscal 21. As Bill mentioned, we believe efforts to divest remaining brands from the original transaction along with incremental cash flow generated from the delay in timing of the transaction relatively close to the value outlined in our original divestiture agreement with Gallo. This assumes we realized the full value of the earn-out. After completing these transformation activities we believe the wine and spirits business will be positioned to produce mid single-digit topline growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30% over time. Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of nearly 7%. The reversal of the year end fiscal 2019 over shipment was minimal in Q3 and came in lower than previously anticipated. We expect the remainder of the shipment timing benefit from fiscal 19 to reverse in Q4. The increase in volume growth for our import portfolio showed continued strength growing nearly 8%. As Bill mentioned, this was mostly driven by continued strong performance of Modelo Especial when including an unfavorable impact from Ballast Point total beer depletions were up 7.3%. In Q4, we pick up the additional selling day that we lost in Q2, which will help us achieve high single-digit depletion growth in Q4. Beer operating margins increased 200 basis points to 39.3%, benefits from pricing and COGS were partially offset by higher marketing and SG&A. COGS benefits were largely driven by FX a one-time contract contractor cost reimbursement and an inventory build ahead of our SAP S/4HANA implementation. The contractor cost recovery and the inventory build helped us outperform our margin expectations for the quarter. I am pleased to report that the first phase of our SAP S/4HANA implementation for our beer operations in Mexico was completed ahead of schedule and with excellent execution by This is an important milestone after more than a year of planning, designing and training for this important initiative. We'll continue to update you on upcoming milestones of our SAP S/4HANA implementation. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 30 basis points to 11%. Marketing spend for the quarter was slightly below expectations. We expect fiscal 20 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. For fiscal 20, we now expect net sales growth of 7% to 8%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a result of the plan reversal of fiscal '19 shipment timing benefit. We expect full-year fiscal 20 depletion volume growth to land about one percentage point ahead of shipment volume growth. We also expect fiscal 20 operating income growth of 8% to 9% and our full year operating margin to be in the range of 39.5% to 40% which is an improvement compared to the previous year and prior FY20 guidance of 39.3%/. As we move toward next year we're excited about our plans to launch Corona hard seltzer at the beginning of fiscal 21. There will be some investment in production costs, as we ramp up production for this major innovation in addition to the significant marketing investment Bill mentioned earlier. Moving to wine and spirits, net sales declined 10% on shipments that were down 14%. Depletions declined 6%, Q3 results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to a shipment timing benefit. Our third quarter wine and spirits results were somewhat impacted by a shift in Thanksgiving holiday timing with retailer and distributor replenishment shifting to the fourth quarter. Last year there was one full week post-Thanksgiving to fully replenish. In addition to the shift of the Thanksgiving holiday, we continue to be impacted by transition activities with distributors and will some lower quality sales incentives and pricing activities that we've decided not to repeat in order to better align with our strategy for the business going forward. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits were more than offset by higher COGS and higher SG&A as a percent of net sales, Higher COGS mostly reflect freight cost headwinds. The higher SG&A as a percent of net sales included marketing investments driven by the continued support of the power brands, including new Product development initiatives and may only advertising in the quarter. We now expect fiscal 20 wine and Spirits' net sales and operating income to decline 8% to 10%. Our updated guidance reflects the revised transaction close assumptions discussed earlier. As part of the Wine and Spirits Transactions, we remain committed to our $130 million stranded cost reduction plan, which we now expect to be realized over -- over the fiscal 21 to fiscal 22 timeframe. I remain confident that the wine and spirits transformation strategy is working. Power brand performance continues to benefit from our increased focus and marketing investments. In fiscal '20 we're running a bit short of our mid-single digit Power Brand depletion growth target, largely due to the activity as I mentioned earlier. However, power brands are driving mix benefits in gaining share in IRI channels and you should expect to see a sequential improvement in depletion trends in Q4. When you include this mix benefits we believe our portfolio of post divestitures is on track to achieve our longer-term targets, including mid-single digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at 149 million, up slightly versus Q3 year-to-date last year. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $230 million reflecting an increase for insurance related costs, higher incentive compensation and the ramp in IT spend, which includes our S/4HANA implementation in other digital enablement activities. We expect our SG&A look to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented. When we can eliminate redundant IT costs and realize the benefits of the new platform. In Q3 comparable basis interest expense increased 11%. This primarily reflects additional interest expense related to the funding of our incremental Canopy Growth investment in fiscal -- in November of 2018. Fiscal 20 interest expense is now expected to approximate $430 million. Our Q3 comparable basis. Effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17.5% versus 14.1% last year. This increase primarily reflects lower stock-based compensation benefits. We now expect our full year fiscal 20 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximately 18% the one percentage point rate increase versus our guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower stock-based benefits and higher expense for miscellaneous tax items than we previously forecasted. I'd like to note that we expect our full year cash tax rate to be in the mid to high single-digit range. Let's move to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activity towards CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 20. This represents an impressive 14% increase. Free cash flow improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We now expect full year CapEx spend of $700 million to $800 million versus our original guidance of 800 million to 900 million. This includes approximately $560 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries as well as the fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. We expect fiscal 20 operating cash flow to be in the range of 2.2 billion to 2.4 billion and free cash flow to be in the range of 1.5 to 1.6 billion. Now let's discuss several impacts that were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. Last quarter, we noted that we expected to recognize a loss in Q3 on the write-down of assets held for sale related to our transaction with Gallo. The actual write-downs of $340 million was largely driven by the $250 million of contingent consideration associated with the revised transaction price. Accounting rules govern our election to record the contingent consideration when it's determined to be realizable. We also recognized $547 million of net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with tax reform in Switzerland. Moving to Canopy the total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November 2017 is $223 million. In Q3, we recognized $534 million decrease in the fair value of the Canopy investment. As a reminder Constellation's original warrants with Canopy have an exercise price of $12.98 Canadian per share and will expire on May 1 2020 and represent less than $200 million in consideration. In addition, the tranche A warrants expire on November, 1 of 2023, the company will evaluate exercise of each of these warrants immediately prior to expiration and does not plan to make additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the potential exercise of these warrants. I would Close with some comments on capital allocation. First and foremost, as Bill mentioned constellation remains committed to its goal of returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases over the fiscal 20 to fiscal 2 timeframe. I am pleased to report that in Q3 we returned to our targeted leverage ratio range this was at the early end of the 12 to 18-month timeframe. We committed to when we closed on the Canopy investments, excludes non-cash Canopy related equity earnings. Continued deleveraging, driven by the company's strong cash flow generation capabilities should provide the flexibility to be opportunistic and increased share repurchases as we move into fiscal 21 and 22. As I reflect on my time as CFO Constellation, I'm proud to have been in this role during a time of significant value creation. I remain bullish about Constellation's prospects and believe the company has the right strategy in place to produce top tier performance for many years to come. I look forward to creating value for Canopy shareholders including Constellation in my new role in Canopy growth. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey, good afternoon everybody. David Congratulations question on seltzer it's obviously going to be an incredibly competitive category for calendar 2020. What's going to make your your proposition different and how are you thinking about of our marketing spend and investment given that it seems like it's really building up to be a pretty significantly competitive category this summer? And then second separately, on your deleverage comments are you happy to keep the levels that where they are now and everything incremental from here is a buyback to manage to those levels or should we be thinking about it differently? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure, I'll take the first half of that, we're very excited about Corona hard seltzer in part, just because of the refreshment DNA that's attached to the Corona brand. We obviously have done a lot of product testing a lot of product research to make sure that we have a product that meets or exceeds the other key players in the marketplace. So we are quite comfortable with the sheer quality of the product that we're going to bring to the table. And as usual Kaumil Gajrawala : Marketing department will bring outstanding consumer communications as I always do around our critical brands. The last thing I would say is, we still believe that there is a lot of upside in the total size of the Seltzer business. It was roughly 60 million cases in 2019. And we believe there could be a 2 to 3 times -- two to three opportunity going forward and we expect to take a significant share of that opportunity. Bill Newlands : Yeah comment on the buybacks, our targeted range is three to four times. Our preference would be at the midpoint of the range but now that we're now that we're back in the range we will definitely look to be opportunistic as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nik Modi : Yeah, thanks, good morning everyone. David, let me -- secondly , congratulations on your new opportunity. So the question is really around, if I can go back to capital allocation still, obviously a lot of investors for years have been concerned about constellation, capital allocation decision and the last few months have been tough right with Ballast Point with Canopy value declines. So maybe just kind of give us a state of the union, from your perspective, kind of what you've learned as an organization from Ballast point in particular and how you think about just capital deployment outside of obviously the buyback stuff that you guys have already committed to you can get people a sense of kind of how you're thinking about it Philosophically as you kind of go into year two of being CEO of this company? Bill Newlands : Sure. I think I think one of the things and David just pointed out, we remain as committed as we always have to getting ourselves into the range and as he said, we're pleased that we have gotten into the top end of our range, earlier than we had anticipated. We have a tremendous amount of opportunity with our core existing franchisees you have seen and you will continue to see a relentless focus on the critical categories and brands that we see as high margin, high-growth opportunities and we will invest to take significant share within those where we see issues and problems, much like you point out the Ballast Point or the low end of our wine business, we are prepared to take action to make sure we are focused on where the consumer is going rather than where they have been. And those are two examples of that. I think what that will do -- that will allow us to continue to focus all of our attention on the premiumization play both in the beer business and the Wine and spirits business so that we continue to be the leader and when someone sits in this chair 10 years from now, they'll be able to tell the same story that I just told, which is a great decade of tremendous growth for our company and for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivian -- with Cowen. Your line is now open. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Hi, good morning. My congrats to you, David I really look forward to working with you. It's part of my coverage of Canopy. So, Bill I just wanted to follow up on your commentary around the dislocation that you think hard seltzer is driving based on the consumer insights you offered. You think it's kind of broad-based and it's under indexing to imported beer. How are you think not asking for guidance for fiscal '21, but are you expecting that dynamic to shift given the introduction of Corona hard seltzer and perhaps put it more specifically how much cannibalization might you guys be expecting in terms of interaction between your core Corona offerings and that hard seltzer proposition, thank you. Bill Newlands : Well, I think that excites us about the Corona seltzer introduction is that first of all, the category appears to continue to have real strength. And this is a lot of growth potential in it. As I said a moment ago I think there's probably 2x to 3x where it sits today, which creates tremendous opportunity for those of us, we're going to play in the category. I think on our expectation would be that we would have a similar type of cannibalization profile that we saw around Premier, which is as you might recall, was in the 70% to 75% range Incremental so this, we think this is a great opportunity for us. But, I would also encourage all of you on the call to keep in mind as they -- exciting is this launch will be Modelo Especial is likely to be our single biggest grower next year. This continues to be a brand that is absolutely on fire. It grew 15% and the most recent period and it had 30 plus consecutive years of double-digit growth. This is a brand that's going to be and remain a significant foundational play for this company for many, many years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good morning everyone. And David, I want to extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to pick up on the beer guidance so Bill, you sounded pretty positive. Despite some of the slowing that we saw on the Nielsen data . I think you attributed to pricing, but as I look at the midpoint, if my math is right, it implies about 7.5% organic sales growth. The year-over-year comp is easier if you do get an additional selling day. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in the business -- Corona looks a little bit light, Premier looks like it's decelerated a bit, is there anything that gives you cause a bit of pause here with the base portfolio in terms of some deceleration. And then given that as we look at the 7% to 9% longer-term growth that you've expressed confidence in over the intermediate term the fact that we had to tweak it modestly lower this year should that be at all concerning for investors looking out to next year. Thank you? Bill Newlands : Sure. No, I think you should be very positive about our expectations around our core business. We were particularly excited that the Corona Extra business returned and renewed in growth in the third quarter. As I stated, certainly the price increases that we talk, particularly in the State of California gave us a very brief factor that you saw in the most recent IRI data, but we do not expect that to have any impact on our longer-term trends in the back as I alluded to earlier, our December depletion growth profile overall was in the high single-digit range, which is ahead of our year-to-date trends. So we remain very very bullish. And when you think about things like Modelo and Pacifico and the addition of our seltzer business. I think you're going to see a continued strong delivery against our business in the range that we had said we would do. And with that we will deliver for this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. Also want to extend my congrats to David. Just two quick clarifications on the beer business. Bill, you mentioned that the high single-digit depletion growth in December. I think that included an extra day though, so ex the extra day what type of rate are you trying to get and then David, you mentioned the contractor and inventory timing benefit of margins in the quarter, can you give us a sense of how much that was. And those are more clarifications, if you give me the benefit of additional question. You guys did comment on the fabulous track record of beer volume growth over the last decade and kudos for that obviously an amazing track record, but if you do look at the year-to-date depletion growth of 7%. It's below that 9% to 10% pace from the prior few years. I know it's close to what you guys originally expected. But just at a high level, taking a step back, just curious for your perspective on if the slowdown this fiscal year, that's just more of a natural maturation as you move the larger case volumes if we should expect sort of a gradual slowdown in depletion over time on larger numbers or if there were more discrete issues driving the sequential slowdown this year and this is not sort of the start of a moderation trend as you look out longer term. Thanks. Bill Newlands : So relative to the our depletion trends for the fourth quarter we expect fully expect that our depletion trends for the fourth quarter are going to be in the high single-digit range much like December presented itself. Look we remain extremely bullish about the long-range prospects for our beer business Dara Mohsenian : We are significantly, significantly outperforming the overall category as well as the high end of the category as well and that's before we introduced hard seltzer product, which will compete [indiscernible] admittedly has gotten very big, very fast. So this will provide us with I think renewed opportunity for growth and we are very excited about the cost base for that going into the new fiscal year, obviously as a reminder, we will give fiscal guidance during our next call. So we will refrain from doing that at this point in time but certainly, we're very excited not only about the fourth quarter and finishing our year very strongly but for next year as well. Bill Newlands : Yeah there on the contractor settlement even in the year S/4HANA kind of production build that we did in Q3 that gave us a benefit you know these are all a few to several million dollars each. And if you think about last year -- rewind to last year I think in Q3, we had an issue with glass production in the quarter. So we get these impacts every single quarter that are -- call it $3 million to $7 million each and sometimes they kind of aggregate in our favor, sometimes they go against us. But if you look at our total operating margins in say FY '18 we're at 39.5% FY19 we're at 39.3% and this year we're saying we're going to be between 39.5 million to 40 million. I think by the time you get to the end of the year all these little timing let's go away and we end up in a pretty consistent margin range in this business, which I'll point out maybe for the last time is by far our best-in-class in North American. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hi, good morning everyone. Bill Newlands : Hi good morning. Amit Sharma : Just a couple of questions, one on beer. Bill talked about the long-term outlook and it looks like you're still confident on high-single digit. Can you talk about Modelo in particular -- still growing double-digit but some people are little bit concerned about the detail that we saw recently. Can you talk about what is in the pipeline from a Modelo perspective. As you look to continue this momentum and then wine David good to hear 30% operating margin outlook still intact with that business. Can you talk about the timeline of the stranded cost as they come out post the divestiture of the lower price brands. Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure, I'd say, and I've said this many times I think Modelo remains the single largest opportunity for this company. David Klein : It is just beginning to craft into the general market if this had a very, very strong run with its core Hispanic base and continues to grow with that audience and as many of you know, we do have a great tailwind with the growth of the Hispanic consumer. In the United States, which will continue to give us a tailwind for a fair amount of time, but as you know our advertising in our marketing activities around the Gallo have been expanded to a broader audience and the growth profile within the non-Hispanic consumer is tremendous. So we see our remaining tremendous upside in Modelo going to your question that about what else we will be introducing the more products, so in different size we have size opportunities. And as you all know we have done nothing truly to innovate around Modelo outside of the business which has done extremely well for us. So we think Modelo is going to continue to be a not well into the next decade, and we will likely be the single largest growth product and brand for us going forward. Amit Sharma : Yeah, on the topic of stranded costs, it's a bit of the story we told at the beginning of this year, almost on a one-year delay. We, we're saying it's a $130 million stranded costs without getting into specifics, that will be included, when we provide guidance next quarter. You can assume that a quarter to a third of those costs come out in FY '21 the rest in FY '22, because we have the flow through COGS to hit before it hits our P&L, so like FY '23 will be the first real clean year where we can take a look at that, seeing a lot of stranded costs coming up or being [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks, good morning. So I was hoping you can talk a little bit about the increased marketing spend on Corona because last quarter. Right you took the opportunity to say look beer profitability is coming in a bit of had a plan, we'll put some extra money behind Corona clearly, there's been some reaction at the same time, the marketing spend on beer came in a little bit light of plan. So if you can just give us some color on why the spend was a little bit lighter kind of plans looking forward, and what in that marketing mix is particularly had a particularly attractive return would be interesting. Thanks. David Klein : Sure, and I'll comment on, on the kind of timing of spend and it really is, it's a timing issue. We expect that we will finish the year that said, in the 9.5% to 10% range of net sales. At the same time, we expect Lauren Lieberman : That we will see an uptick in our marketing spend in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. Some of that having to do with incremental investment behind our core brands, but also some of it having to do with basically production costs around the seltzer marketing campaign that Bill outlined earlier. So I think for marketing for us, it really is just a function of timing as we still are focused on a 9.5% to 10% range. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. A couple of just kind of follow up clarifications. First, it looks to us that the price mix was about 1.6%. Can you give us a sense of what that would have been without Ballast Point and then second, following up on some of the comments on Corona seltzer you made some comments that it's being well received by retailers, can you give us a sense of how you see the shelf sets coming out next year where Corona seltzer is going to be positioned on the shelf versus beer versus other white claw. And then if you look at the White claw trends they've been unbelievable. Right. I mean, they've been they're actually increasing share. I think the latest share is something like 67% up from 60. What gives you the confidence that this is actually a hard seltzer segment as opposed to a white claw segment and that there is room for a lot of new competitors. Thank you. David Klein : Sure. So let's talk about the sets and where we expect to see Seltzer. Seltzer is in all likelihood not going to take space from our core beer franchise the consumer views it is something different. The retailers viewing it as something different, whether it's on the shelf or in the cold box. So we think there will be a distinct differentiation of product location versus just cannibalizing existing shelf space. That's the way it's been so far, we believe that will continue. This -- the answer to your question regarding whether this is a category or a brand. I think we've solved that answer for ourselves with Research. Our consumer and the seltzer consumer is very interested in the idea of Corona hard seltzer. In part because of what I said earlier, which is a whole refreshment DNA around the core Corona brand. The strength of Corona in that whole refreshment Bill Newlands : The Beach experience is perfect for this. As we said earlier, that the these seltzer consumer -- has generally been increasing their overall consumption of the total alcoholic beverage category, which I think speaks well for the overall category of seltzers going forward and the strength of the Corona brand name together with the investment that we're going to make against it, we're quite bullish on it. Robert Ottenstein : And Robert on the price mix question, it might be, if we were just looking at imports, it might be 10 to 15 basis points, but not -- additional to that -- not much more . Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Powers : Thanks and congratulations from me to David maybe coming at the beer outlook from another direction. Just coming back and coming into calendar '19 at the beer event in Chicago, you guys are pretty adamant the beer margins would trend flattish, more or less in line with where you finished last year, call it 39.5 as you said. But now we're three quarters into fiscal '20 beer margins have exceeded expectations three quarters in a row, raising the full-year outlook and arguably 4Q would seem to have potential upside embedded in that -- as well. Acknowledging some of the 3Q benefits that could reverse, I guess as you step back does any of that change your go-forward thinking as to where beer margins could ultimately aspire to especially without the recent drag from Ballast. I mean is there, I guess is there a structural upside to your prior outlook or do you attribute the recent strength. Just to some of those timing that's that you had mentioned earlier, David. Bill Newlands : So I'll start with that, David, can add as we would like. During that discussion. One of the things we were quite clear about relative to our guidance is there will be some years where things go our way cost are better, FX is better certain things just simply are favorable to what we would view as sustainable long-term proposition around our margin structure, this year has been one of those and we're certainly happy to take it, but it's also realistic to recognize that those things can go either way. As I said, this year it has gone in our favor, and we continue to work. As you would expect on our, on our operational footprint to make sure we are extracting every ounce of opportunity as it relates to cost, but this year on our way and we're quite pleased that it has. David, you want to. David Klein : Yeah, -- Steve, I would say that we are, please. I'm convinced we have some of the best operations people on the planet. In order to produce the results that we do on a consistent basis. A new -- caution Steve Powers : Is that -- I think we've been clear about this is that when we are in the launch year from a seltzer standpoint. We know that we're going to be driving towards the high end of our marketing spend as a percent of SG&A range. We also know as I said in my script that there are going to be some drag on gross margins as we come out of the gate on Seltzers. However, we've also said that we believe over time Seltzers don't have to be a drag and we don't expect them to be a drag over time. Right, so I think you're going to see puts and takes in our business as Bill outlined, but I'm actually pretty pleased with the consistency of margins in, as I said 39.5% percent range for three years in a row. Bill Newlands : I would just add to David's comments that much like our beer margin structure is best of class. I think you would expect that our seltzer margin structure as we get to critical mass, will also be best-in class versus the competition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning, David. Congratulations also on your promotion and thank you for your work as a CFO on Constellation. So my question is a follow-up on the comment about increased investment on the Seltzer marketing should we budget part of it already in the fourth quarter and also increase in early first quarter in fiscal 2021 because I understand the launch is early -- fiscal year in March, -- early March. So relative to the typical launches or the typical innovation that happens around [indiscernible]. And a clarification, if I will in Shifting gears a little bit for wine and spirits. So the implied fourth quarter wine and spirits profit guidance it's down so far it's down 13% year to date. So the full year is down 8 to 10, which implies that you have an improved performance in the fourth quarter. So if you can elaborate on that as well? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yes, so on marketing spend. Yeah. We expect that that our spend will be up on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And that's -- you can kind of calculate back to get into that 9.5% to 10% range. As I said, that's most likely to be seltzer production marketing production costs and then we think that this has been -- will be a little bit weighted to the first quarter and certainly the first half of the year. Well, we're just getting the product on the shelf. We'll want to make sure that we're driving a consumer activity at that point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Bill Kirk : Thank you, so I have a quick question on cannabis obviously you've worked with Canopy on the beverage launch up in Canada, and as I understand it Acreage can bring Canopy IP technology including that beverage technology to the US. So I guess my question is, would you want acreage in the US to start making the products that you developed with Canopy. Bill Newlands : Yeah, I think the best thing that, so it's not our decision. Let me just be clear about that is acreages decision, but to the extent that we develop outstanding products for use in the Canadian market if Acreage can bring those to the US and they\u2019re comfortable to do so, we think that's a home run all around like throughout our cannabis ecosystem, if you will, that's a benefit to Canopy that's a benefit to acreage in some of our Constellation team has been helpful in making sure that the products are meeting the expectations of the consumer in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open. Sean King : Hi, thanks, you called out Refresca as the growth driver, but it's still, it's pretty small in the track channels. Where do you stand in terms of I guess the national rollout strategy and how do you expect Seltzer to interact with Refresca I guess on the shelf. Bill Newlands : Yes, we're very pleased with the Refresca, it has outperformed what our expectations were. And we're going to continue to invest behind it to make sure it continues to grow, as I said a little earlier, we don't expect the shelf interaction to get in the way between our Seltzer and our and our Refresca businesses. We think they serve different needs although admittedly, there is some interaction between in FMB consumer and Seltzer consumer. But we think there is room for both of those products in the market and we're looking forward to seeing continued acceleration of both the Refresca franchise as well as the, as well as -- Hard Seltzer when it comes out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Bill Chappell : Thank you so much. And David, congratulations -- two quick ones. Any kind of guidance on what the peso versus the dollar impacted a beer margins this quarter or is that more to come. In future quarters and then also in terms of kind of what you talked about marketing spend in following Andreas question Bill Newlands : Is this, similar, when we look at the first quarter of 2021 to what we saw 18 months ago with the rollout of Premier in terms of kind of pulling forward marketing more spending very front-end loaded or is it more balanced throughout the year? David Klein : Yes, so on FX and again, we get some volatility in FX in the IR team. I think that\u2019s a nice job of trying to lock in bumps in the peso which gives us a little tailwind -- especially given the volatility between the USD and the peso over the last couple of years. Right, so we think that in the quarter that was about 60 basis points of impact on margins. And then -- yeah, I think you can think about it a lot like Premier. So kind of the spread throughout the quarters of the year should look just like the Premier launch. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : Yes, good morning, Bill. And David, I'd like to have a question on Corona Premier and Familiar, specifically regarding Familiar when looking at the Nielsen data over the last few payouts. We are seeing an accelerated decline, so is it deliberate choice as it seems, and you keep mentioning it -- you are incurring Corona in the refreshment space that Familiar may not fit and to provide pretty more space for Modelo to grow. And then on Corona Premier growth is plateauing. It seems like it's getting to the size of Corona. So is there any sense you can revamp that brand and reaccelerate the growth or are you satisfied with the current performance of Corona Premier so just one. Thank you. Bill Newlands : So relative to Familiar. Familiar continues to do very well, particularly in the core Hispanic community, which is where it was originally targeted. So we continue to think that Familiar is going to be an important part, particularly with the Hispanic consumer in very specific demographics and very specific geographic regional opportunities. Relative to Premier, Premier continues to do very nicely and we're excited about it, obviously there has been some impact. The cannibalization that has occurred has been impacting Light as you would expect to some degree. But Premier also opens up a bunch of new consumers to our franchise as well who are looking more for that low-carb positioning that Premier presents. So we remain very bullish on the future for Premier, and we're going to continue to invest against that franchise going forward. And again, it goes right back to -- we are always pleased when more and more consumers spend more and more dollars against the overall Corona franchise. People believe in this franchise. It is the number one, as I said before, number one most trusted brand with both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers 21 to 54 and that gives us the chance to continue to leverage -- new introductions like Refresca, Premier, and Hard Seltzer which is obviously coming in this coming fiscal year. So we remain very bullish on the overall Corona franchise and I think the fact that franchise was one of the few growth brand franchises over the course of the last decade, shows the real longevity for that brand. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Well, thanks very much. And I guess I'd be remiss David if I didn't say that all the congratulations you just received are well deserved. We're certainly going to miss you on this side, but we'll be happy to get our 37%. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Before our closing, I'd like to reiterate what a powerful decade this year been for Constellation our results over the past 10 years are a testament to the dynamic strategic efforts made by our strong management team, through our current initiatives and priorities. We are positioning this company for a sustained long-term success and therefore we are just as excited and optimistic that the next 10 years will continue the momentum into the fourth quarter as well as a strong finish to this fiscal year. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call. As I said earlier, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again everyone for joining the call. I wish you all a safe happy and prosperous New Year and new decade thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year-end fiscal \u20182020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to what we\u2019ve done in prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Let me add my welcome as well. Let me quickly frame up the key themes you're going to hear from Garth and me today. First, we delivered strong performance in fiscal \u201820, led by our beer business which generated double-digit operating income for the year with accelerating IRI trends as Q4 progressed, and that momentum has continued in the early stages of fiscal \u201821. We have ample brewing capacity to continue fueling the growth of our beer business in the medium term, and we're working with local authorities and government officials in Mexico to ensure we have ample long-term capacity as our business continues to grow and evolve. Second, our high-end power brands and successful new product launches fueled performance in fiscal \u201820 that drove accelerating depletion trends in Q4 for our wine and spirit business as our premiumization strategy continues to take hold. And third, our strong performance and fit financial discipline generated record cash flow, reduced our outstanding debt, and built solid momentum heading into fiscal \u201821. We'll talk in more detail about each of these areas, but before we go any further, I'd like to take a minute to address current circumstances related to the COVID-19 outbreak. First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by this terrible virus and to the first responders and healthcare professionals working to help those in need. We sincerely hope the increased efforts to more fully contain this virus gain strong traction soon. With this in mind, we operate with a customer-focused mindset, a genuine concern for people and a desire to make a positive difference in our communities that is core to our DNA, even more important today as our industry and communities face substantial hardships. As such, constellation along with a number of our brands, has committed more than $2.5 million toward COVID-19 relief efforts that will directly benefit our business partners and communities now and through their recovery. Specifically, we are supporting the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, Restaurant Employee Relief Fund; the U.S. Bartenders Guild and first responders who continue to support those in need in communities across the U.S. I'm also extremely proud of the Constellation team for their continued efforts to meet the needs of consumers and to help keep the economy going while also keeping our people safe. The health and wellbeing of our employees is our number one priority, and we've taken a number of preventative measures and provided a number of protections to keep our employees safe in our operations and out at retail and to ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of the market. Our production facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Italy, and New Zealand are operational and our distributors are up and running. Our teams are also working hard to ensure our distributor and retail partners have ample supply of our products to meet consumer demand, particularly in the off-premise, which has seen accelerated growth as many restaurants and bars have suspended dine-in services to help mitigate spread of the virus. The off-premise channel represents 85% to 90% of depletion volume for both our beer and our wine and spirits businesses and over-indexes to the rest of the beverage alcohol industry in the U.S. versus the on-premise channel. These trends are reflected in recent IRI data ending 3 \u201822, which shows accelerating consumer takeaway trends in off-premise channels. Specifically, we've seen IRI dollar sales growth for our beer business increase to 24% in the four-week period ending 3 \u201822 versus 12-week and 52-week trends of 17 and 12 respectively. For our wine spirits power brands, we're also seeing accelerating growth, up 23% in the latest four-week period versus 12 and 52-week trends of 7 and 4. During this time, we are focused on the channels the consumer is choosing, namely 3-tier e-commerce, direct-to-consumer and the off-premise, especially big box grocery, mass and club channels where we are working diligently to ensure high-end stock positions for our key SKUs. We've also adjusted our marketing approach to ensure our consumer messaging is in tune with current realities and by shifting our focus to digital and social media platforms as sporting events and other major gatherings are suspended. Bottom line, we are well-positioned to continue meeting the needs of consumers as well as our retailer and distributor partners. We will continue to manage our business with focus and discipline, while remaining flexible and are willing to adapt as needed to shifting consumer behaviors. And I remain extremely optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. Now, let's get back to those themes that I highlighted at the top of the call. As mentioned, our beer business once again delivered exceptional results in fiscal \u201820 and continues to be the leader in the high-end and a cornerstone of growth in the U.S. beer industry. Imports continued to be one of the primary growth drivers in the high-end and the total beer category with Constellation driving 100% of the growth in this segment. The primary drivers of our beer portfolio growth continues to be our Modelo and Corona brand families. The trio of brands that comprise the Casa Modelo brand family includes Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada and is one of the biggest forces in beer, delivering more than 20 million cases of growth to the U.S. beer category, last year. Modelo Especial led the way as the top non-seltzer share gaining beer brand in the U.S. beer industry, achieving depletion growth of more than 16%, an acceleration over the previous year\u2019s trend of 12%. Modelo Especial is now the number four beer brand overall in the U.S. beer market and the best selling beer in major markets like Chicago, as well as the States of Nevada and California where sales of the brand are greater than the two biggest premium domestic light brands, combined. We plan to invest at record levels this year for Modelo to reach more consumers and to increase the brand's appeal among total market consumers. We\u2019ll accomplish this through innovation, investment in Spanish language media and targeted programming and will extend the brand through new pack sizes such as our seven ounce Modelito a popular format, particularly in C-stores, Innovation with new product offerings like Modelo Chelada, Mango Chile, and we're testing new spirits Barrel-Aged offerings on a smaller scale that remain true to the essence of the Modelo brand and align with consumer's desire for more flavor. I'm talking about Modelo Reserva, which is a golden, sessionable, refreshing lager with a 5.5% ABV that will be available in test markets in tequila and bourbon barrel-aged options. Modelo\u2019s strength with Hispanic consumers continues to fuel the growth of this brand and with more than 1 million Hispanics reaching legal drinking age each year, combined with our continued efforts to broaden our appeal with general market consumers. We believe we're only scratching the surface of where this brand can go. Our flagship Corona brand remains the number one imported brand family in the U.S., selling just shy of 150 million cases in fiscal \u201820. In fiscal \u201821, we'll embark on a comprehensive master brand restage for the Corona brand family that drives a more cohesive look and greater consistency in marketing communications across sub brands, as well as new heritage and experiential programs designed to strengthen the bonds consumers already have with Corona. We're also excited to launch a new cause marketing program, focused on protecting our beaches, through our partnership with Oceanic Global, a leader in ocean conservation. We believe this program will further deepen the emotional connection Corona consumers have with the brand. Corona Extra is the seventh largest brand in the U.S. beer category, and remains the number one brand in New York City, Miami, D.C., and is a top three brand in eight other major U.S. markets. Brand equity for Corona Extra remains extremely strong, and sales have accelerated in IRI with 4-week and 12-week trends outpacing their corresponding 52-week trends. We remain bullish on Corona Extra's future potential, knowing that there are several large DMAs that based on high per capita income are right for Corona Extra growth. In only a second year as a national brand, Corona Premier grew depletions nearly 19% in fiscal \u201820 to 10 million cases and became the number five growth brand in the U.S. beer category with distribution continuing to grow double digits. In just two years, Corona Premier has achieved an ACV of almost 75, which is similar to some brands that have been around for decades. This brand is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the macro trends of betterment, premiumization as consumers trade up from domestic life. And we have plans in place to continue building traction for this brand, including winning with Hispanic consumers who compromise about 30% of its consumer base. In fiscal '20 Corona Refresca became a 3 million case brand in its first year, with a variety pack becoming the number five top selling new beer in IRI. This now gives Corona an ownable play in the ABA space, delivering tropical flavors to a range of consumers. To capitalize on the success Refresca, we will be extending the brand into the high ABV FMB space this fall with the launch of Corona Refresca [Mass] [ph], 24-ounce cans with 8% ABV in tropical berry and mango citrus flavors. We are very excited about this year's Corona Hard Seltzer launch, which is off to a strong start and has already achieved an ACV approaching 50 in its first month of national launch.  As we've said before, the hard seltzer category continues to grow at a breakneck clip, and we believe it's here to stay. As an aside, our recent venture investment in Press Seltzer provides a wonderful complement with a unique value proposition and price point, as we believe the hard seltzer segment will price stratify over time.  Our Pacifico brand grew depletions more than 13% in fiscal \u201820 which represents an acceleration over the previous year. Pacifico is the number seven beer overall in California, where it continues to grow double digits. In fiscal \u201821, our plans will focus on continuing to win in California, while further expanding awareness and trial in key DMAs across the country. This includes a 40% increase in digital marketing investment, including our first national YouTube buy, a new sponsorship with the LA Chargers, and continued partnerships with the Summer and Winter X Games, which will help us to do just that. In addition to our continued focus on accelerating growth for our core beer franchises, we're also leveraging innovation and domestic production capabilities to launch new to-world brands that allow us to compete in growing sectors of the high end. Our recent launch of Two Lane in partnership with country music star Luke Bryan is a great example. This beer plays in the domestic high-end sessionable space and delivers on a refreshing taste consumers want with only 99 calories, 3 grams of carbs and 4.2% ABV. In fiscal \u201821, Two Lane will be available in select markets in the Southeast. In support of our efforts to build brands consumers love, our commercial team continues to work with our three-tier partners to ensure we deliver world-class execution at retail. This includes increasing adoption of shopper-first shelf principles, by making it easier for consumers to shop by organizing shelf flow in ways that help maximize growth and profitability and by meeting consumers where they are going by allocating space based on future growth opportunities and ensuring highly incremental packages with high velocity are represented with adequate holding power. We currently have 6,000 retailers that have implemented shopper-first shelf principles and those who have embraced this program have seen solid increases in overall growth and profitability for their category. As you can see, we believe fiscal \u201821 holds great promise for our beer business with a healthy core, master brand innovations and emerging brands poised to grow. From an operational perspective, we continue to make strategic investments in our beer business to ensure we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to support the continued growth of our business in the medium-term based on our forecasts. The capacity we\u2019ve built in Nava plus Obregon when completed at the end of this year will enable us to provide more than 400 million cases of beer, which is ample supply for several years to come. We also completed construction of furnace number five at our glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery, which now supplies 60% of the glass needs for that brewery, resulting in significant logistics savings. Earlier this week, I met with Mexican president, L\u00f3pez Obrador and his team in Mexico to discuss our brewery construction project in Mexicali. Our discussions were constructive and surfaced several options for consideration. We will continue to work with local authorities and government officials in Mexico to reach an optimal solution for our business. We've had a positive, mutually beneficial relationship with Mexico for more than 30 years and we fully expect this to continue. Some of you have asked about our operations. Let me just say that we are being exceedingly careful to protect our people and to maintain ultimate safety. With that said, over the past several weeks, we've taken steps to build ample product supply across our warehouse and distributor network in the U.S. We have close to 70 days in the system and we\u2019ve shifted resources to accelerate production of high-volume SKUs for key off-premise accounts. Our facilities are currently operating and we remain confident in our ability to continue meeting the needs of U.S. consumers and did not expect any near-term service disruption to retailers. Shifting now, our wine and spirits premiumization strategy continues to show promise as our business closed out fiscal \u201820 in a position of strength, posting accelerating power brand depletion growth and operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter power brand\u2019s family depletion growth accelerated to more than 4%, led by double-digit growth for Kim Crawford, Meiomi and The Prisoner Brand Family, as this collection of brands continued to outpace the total U.S. wine market. Operating margin expansion was driven by our focus on more efficient price promotions with our mainstream power brands, as well as market share gains in the higher end of our portfolio with Meiomi and The Prisoner family contributing strong mix trends. Innovation continues to fuel growth as we capitalize on innovation trends in consumer-driven growth segments. Our introduction last quarter of Unshackled by The Prisoner Wine Company has been extremely well received. We further capitalized on Barrel-Aged wine trends with the introduction of new offerings from both Woodbridge and Cooper & Thief. Since launching our first Barrel-Aged wine series a little more than two years ago, we have sold well over 2 million cases, and that number continues to climb. In response to the consumer-led trends around convenience, we launched Kim Crawford wine in a can. And our Crafters Union brand remains the number one growth driver in the can wine segment. We're also excited about the recent launches of SVEDKA botanical flavors, and Ruffino Organic Prosecco, which align with consumer trends for flavor, betterment and sustainability. Bottom-line for fiscal '20, our wine, spirit transformation focused on premiumization continues to gain traction. Our higher end power brands are driving mix and margin expansion. Our mainstream power bands are outgrowing the competition. And our innovation initiatives are fueling growth through velocity and distribution gains. Heading into fiscal \u201821, we are committed to investments in bold innovations, compelling, marketing campaigns, and immersive brand experiences with a specific focus on top markets and accounts in priority DMAs. We'll continue building momentum by further leaning into our premiumization strategy and maximizing growth opportunities for our power brands through compelling marketing campaigns for Woodbridge, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA and The Prisoner. We're instituting greater pricing discipline, consistent with strategies that have proven very successful in building strong brands in other parts of our beverage portfolio. And, we'll continue to leverage the power of existing brands with strong equity. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation in growing sectors of the wine and spirits categories that align with consumer trends. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year, including upcoming line extensions for Ruffino and SVEDKA Vodka in the RTD space. The launch of a new High West pre-mixed cocktail in the spirit space, and the extension of our highly successful Barrel-Aged wine program. You can also expect us to introduce new-to-world brands in the wine category. In addition, we plan to leverage the success of shopper-first shelf initiative developed by our beer business by adapting and implementing this program for wine and spirits retailers in fiscal '21. We recently took pricing on our Woodbridge brand beginning March 1st, and to-date we have seen no negative impact from this action, due to the consumer need to stick with tried and true brands in this time of uncertainty. We are actively supporting this price increase with marketing investments, including national TV, as well as digital and social advertising. We're in the final phase of completing the revised Gallo deal. And we continue to work with the FTC, primarily on the brands that have been excluded from the original deal. We have communicated our intent to retain the Cook\u2019s and J. Rog\u00e9t sparkling wine brands, and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future. In addition, the FTC is vetting potential buyers we have identified for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business. We continue to work in collaboration with Gallo to satisfy all FTC obligations, and both companies are fully committed to getting this deal done. With each step, we're marching closer to the finish line. And we expect to close the deal around the end of our first quarter. Finally, we're very encouraged by the steps David Klein is taking in his new role as CEO of Canopy Growth. David and the Canopy team recently announced their focus on four key areas, improving Canopy's connection with consumers, instilling greater focus and discipline across the organization, defining visible path for profitability and positive cash flow, and building the Company's credibility with key stakeholders. Canopy continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales, with a leading market share in Canada. The Company recently took steps to right size its business to better align with consumer demand and position the Company for long-term success. Canopy just launched its first cannabis beverage product, Tweed Houndstooth & Soda, which has received an overwhelmingly positive consumer response. And they plan to roll out additional beverage products over the last few months. And I can tell you, they are awfully good. These are game-changers. They also have completed their first shipments of cannabis-infused edible chocolates, and Juju Power 510 batteries in December of 2019. We expect further revenue from these products like vape, edibles and beverages gain traction in the marketplace now that rec 2.0 products have been legalized in Canada. Canopy remains best positioned to win long-term and to face challenges associated with this current economic environment, as many competitors without access to capital show signs of trouble. In closing, we reached the conclusion of an excellent year in fiscal \u201820. Our path to these impressive results was paved with great execution and consumer obsession in growing our core business supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and our operations. We are now facing an increasingly challenging operating environment and rapidly changing market conditions. As you can see from our press release, we are not providing formal guidance. However, we provided the targets that are included in our original fiscal \u201821 plan, prior to the COVID-19 crisis. My goal in doing this is to reiterate that our strategy remains unchanged and to provide the confidence we have in the growth prospects for our core business, as I continue to feel very optimistic about our long-term opportunities. When we look at the beverage alcohol category, we are generally a recession-resistant industry. In previous recessions and downturns, the TBA industry has generally been non-cyclical and only minimally affected. Bottom-line, we manage our business for the long term, making tough but necessary decisions to adapt to consumer trends while always looking forward to deliver what's next. We will continue to quickly adapt to rapidly evolving market dynamics, which is a continuation of who we've always been. Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results for fiscal \u201820 and our financial focus for \u201821. Garth Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and hello everyone. Fiscal \u201820 marked another great year for Constellation brands. We produced strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, while our wine and spirits power brand strategy continued to gain momentum as marketplace performance for these brands outpaced the overall U.S. wine and spirits category for fiscal \u201820. Specifically, in fiscal \u201820, we grew comparable basis diluted EPS, excluding Canopy equity earnings by 6%. In addition, we generated record operating cash flow of almost $2.6 billion and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. We also reduced debt by more than $1.4 billion and came within our target leverage range. And we returned over $600 million of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Before going into further detail on fiscal \u201820 results, I want to take a moment to discuss the rapidly changing market conditions due to the impact of COVID-19. To echo Bill, while the COVID-19 outbreak and situation is unprecedented and creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility, one thing remains clear, we will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis. Constellation is a strong cash flow generator, has ample liquidity, financial flexibility, and significant capacity under our $2 billion revolving credit facility. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which allows for flexible access to capital markets and more favorable rates. Furthermore, as Bill mentioned, we continue to work in collaboration with Gallo to satisfy all FTC obligations and both companies remain fully committed to finalizing this transaction. As such, upon close of the Gallo transaction, we expect to receive approximately $850 million in cash, which we plan to use for debt pay down to further advance and progress -- to further advance the progress we've made to reduce our leverage and maintain it within our targeted range. More on fiscal \u201821 in a minute, as I want to continue to expand on the fiscal \u201820 financial performance we delivered before the COVID-19 impacts began to unfold where I\u2019ll generally focus on a comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 8%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of 6% and favorable pricing. Depletion volume growth for the year came 7.5%, while depletion volume growth or import portfolio grew 8%. As expected, depletion volume growth was higher than shipment buying growth, primarily due to the FY19 year-end shipment timing benefit that reversed during our fiscal \u201820, most of which occurred in Q4. Beer gross margin increased 120 basis points to 55.6%, driven by favorability in pricing and FX. Our operational cost and efficiency initiatives helped offset the impact of inflation on costs such as materials, labor and freight. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 10%, primarily driven by increased investment for the Modelo and Corona brand families and in support of our innovation activities, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which came in at the higher end of our previous guide range. As a result of the above mentioned factors, we achieved record full-year operating margin of 40%, an improvement of 70 basis points. Moving to wine. Net sales declined 6% on shipment volumes down approximately 8%. Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to stronger mix benefits from our power brands in Q4, driven by The Prisoner, Unshackled and Meiomi. Depletion volume declined 5% while power brand depletions were up 2%. We remain confident that our premiumization strategy is working as power brand trends accelerated as we've finished fiscal \u201820. Operating margins decreased 50 basis points to 26% as mix benefits and favorable SG&A were more than offset by higher COGS, primarily reflecting increased freight costs and an increase in marketing as a percent of net sales, driven by our premiumization and innovation activities. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance, finishing at $224 million, up approximately 13% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs, high incentive compensation, and a ramp-up in IT spend, to support our SAP S/4HANA implementations. Those increases were partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs. Comparable basis interest expense for the year increased 11% to $429 million. This primarily reflects additional interest expense related to the funding of our incremental investments in Canopy Growth in November 2018, partially offset by our debt pay down during fiscal \u201820. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 16.1% versus 18.2% last year. This improvement was driven by lower effective rates from our foreign businesses, partially offset by lower level of stock-based compensation benefits. While stock-based compensation benefits were lower on a full year basis, the benefit came in higher than expected during Q4, which drove the tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance. Now, let's review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 9%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of 7% and favorable pricing. Depletion volume growth for our import portfolio should continue to strength, growing over 11%. When including an unfavorable impact from Ballast Point, total beer depletions were up 10.8%, including the benefit of an additional selling day in Q4. Beer operating margin decreased 120 basis points to 39.3% as increased marketing and SG&A spend was partially offset by benefits from pricing and COGS. Marketing as a percentage of net sales was 8.7% or 230 basis points higher than Q4 last year driven by marketing investments and spend timing. Wine and spirit net sales were up 1% for Q4, while shipment volume was down approximately 1%. As stated earlier, our power brands continued to drive mix benefits. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 28.9%, primarily due to mix benefits and lower marketing and SG&A expenses. Moving to fiscal \u201820 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated a record $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion last year. This represents an impressive 34% increase. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx in the beer segment. CapEx totaled $727 million or 18% below last year spend and in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $520 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operation expansion. Furthermore, through fiscal '20 we've cumulatively spent approximately $700 million in capital related to our Mexicali expansion project. Moving to our full-year fiscal '21 P&L and cash flow targets. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to have roughly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace, almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year, and given the related uncertainty, volatility, and fast-moving developments that have evolved over the month of March, we do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal '21 at this time. With that being said, we thought it would be helpful to highlight some of our key financial targets, assuming a normalized environment for fiscal '21 prior to COVID-19, as reference as you think through your modeling and scenario work given the changing marketplace dynamics. For pre-COVID-19 fiscal '21, the beer business targeted net sales growth of 7% to 8%, which includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. Including the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales growth is 8% to 10%. Operating margin in the 39.5% to 40% range as investments for the Corona Hard Seltzer launch as well as inflation headwinds, primarily related to glass, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico are expected to be greatest in the benefits from product pricing and productivity initiatives. Moving to wine and spirits. For pre-COVID-19 fiscal '21, the wine and spirits business targeted net sales and operating income decline of approximately 30% to 35%. This assumes the revised wine and spirits divestiture transaction with Gallo and the separate divestitures of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the concentrate business closed around the end of Q1 fiscal '21, while the separate but related agreement to divest the Nobilo Wine Brand to Gallo closes by the end of Q2 fiscal '21. Lastly, the plan to retain the Cooks J. Rog\u00e9t sparkling wine brands is also included in our pre-COVID-19 target for fiscal '21. Our pre-COVID-19 expectation for Q1 wine and spirits results assumes a decline of 25% to 30% in sales and operating income due to the following factors : Unfavorable Q1 FY21 comparison due to a very strong quarter last year for the brands to be divested, sales of the Black Velvet brands are not included in this year's Q1 result, as a result of the divestiture late last year, and distributors have ample supply of brands targeted for the Gallo divestiture as they assumed fiscal '20 year end close on the transaction. Our retained portfolio of power brands in the wine and spirits business, including Cook\u2019s and J. Rog\u00e9t target net sales growth of 2% to 4% on a pre-COVDI-19 basis for fiscal '21. Other pre- COVDI-19 target assumptions include interest expense in the range of $385 million to $395 million, comparable tax rates excluding Canopy equity earnings of approximately 18%, weighted average diluted shares outstanding targeted at approximately 195 million, operating cash flow in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. This is a good spot to discuss a few items around capital management and deployment. As you would expect, we\u2019re reviewing in detail all expenses in capital expenditure plans for refinement and flexibility to make sure we prioritize and optimize the spend given the current business conditions and economic environment. While wine and spirits EBIT is moving down in fiscal '21, due to the planned divestitures, we are maintaining our current quarterly dividend rate. In addition, we remain focused on our goal of returning significant capital to shareholders balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases. However, in the short-term, given the uncertainty around the COVDI-19 impact on our business, we will be maximizing free cash flow and utilizing that free cash flow to reduce debt and leverage. We believe longer term, we retained a full flexibility to fulfill our $4.5 billion commitment over time. In closing, I want to reiterate that Constellation is a strong cash flow generator, has ample liquidity and financial flexibility. We remain focused on fruitfully navigating through the challenging environment presented by COVDI-19, and we'll look to provide updates including full year guidance as more factors become known. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : So, I wanted to get some clarification on the Mexican government's decision, which determined that alcohol is non-essential. And I just wanted to make sure I understand what you're sharing with us today that if I heard you correctly, you are not suspending your production. But, what I'm hearing is, a lot of the other brewers are suspending. So, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. And then, curious to hear how you see this situation evolving and maybe what your contingency plans are. You did share with us some of the, I think,, finished inventory that you have on hand to meet the U.S. demand. But I just kind of wanted to understand where you're at with that specific situation. Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. So, as we stand today, we are currently operating. We also have, as I noted in my script, roughly 70 days through the system at either -- and that does not include at retail. That is purely that we have or our distributors have. So, we are fairly confident that we will see no disruption at retail from our operations, and we'll be able to meet consumer demand as it continues. Operator : Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Bill, I think you mentioned that you're working through a series of options on what's going to happen with Mexicali. Obviously, we don't know which of those options you'll take. But, could you at least give some insight on what your options are from this stage? Bill Newlands : We're not prepared to go through what the exact options are. What I would say is this. We had a very productive meeting with the President and his team. I think there is mutual agreement that we have been a strong player in Mexico for 30 plus years, and that that strong relationship is going to continue, and that we will have solutions for the long-term to make sure that we are able to meet the strong consumer demand that we continue to have for our brands. So, while I'm not prepared to talk about the specificity of that, we are very comfortable that our discussions will yield strong, medium and long-term benefits for our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Vivien Azer : Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping to the on-premise off-premise mix, Bill, very helpful in terms of contextualizing the revenue mix. But, Garth, I was wondering, whether you could offer any insight into the margin differential, given the presence of kegs in the on-premise. And then, as a follow-up to that, is it possible for you guys to move cans and bottles that are no longer being sold in the on-premise into the off-premise with the distributors? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Thanks for the question, Vivien. So, to your first question, the margin differential, there's no margin differential for us between on and off-premise, because that goes through -- that all goes through distributors. So, same margin for us. As it relates to the question, can we move product out of the on-premise to the off-premise? Bill Newlands : Let me touch on that Vivien. In many instances, distributors will pick up and redistribute supply where necessary or where a particular channel, like on-premise has effectively closed in many markets. So, yes, that in fact often does occur. Obviously, there's some format differences in terms of what people use in particular channels. But yes, it does occur. Just to reiterate a piece of your question as well. We are multiple points across both, beer, wine and spirits, less reliant in on-premise than the industry overall. So our business has been skewed historically and still is to the off-premise channel, which in an instance like this is very valuable. But, that's not to say, as you've heard, we haven't recognized the many challenges that our friends in the on-premise are having at moment. And we as a company and many of us as individuals have made significant contributions to help those who are in need at the moment and who have run into very challenging times, for those who are in the on-premise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey .Good morning, everyone. Garth, maybe just two quick modeling questions for you. One, in terms of the on, off-premise split for spirits and -- wine and spirit for the year. Could you give us a sense, in the fiscal '21 plan that was unaffected by COVID, what was the growth expectation in those two channels? What were you expecting [indiscernible] home versus growth at home? And then second, if you could give us a sense within both segments of just fixed and variable costs, as we kind of want to run through sensitivity to be able to get a rough sense of fixed and variable costs. Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Bryan, would you mind repeating the first part of that question around the margins? I just -- I didn't quite catch that. Bryan Spillane : So, the second part is just trying to get an understanding of what is fixed versus variable costs in both, the beer, and wine and spirits segments? Garth Hankinson : Yes. Okay. So, fixed versus variable cost is -- for both businesses is they skew highly towards variable, call it somewhere in the neighborhood of two-thirds variable and one-third fixed, maybe a little bit higher in some cases. On the beer side, the variable costs really are around freight and packaging. And in wine it's [freight] [ph] costs and packaging. Then, I believe the first part of your question was around the on-premise versus off-premise growth rates. And for on-premise growth rates, we were modeling in flat and for off-premise it was mid single digits. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just a question on retail. I mean, we are hearing that resets are being pushed back -- resets are being pushed back. And I just wanted to gain an understanding of impacting you guys, because obviously there's a lot of new products coming in the marketplace. Corona Seltzer has gotten into the market but not at full distribution. So, if you could just give it some of the puts and takes in terms of how that's going, are you getting just more space of your A level SKUs in the place of some of the new products that were going to come out in the market? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Bill Newlands : Sure. You bet. We're seeing -- first of all, obviously there was -- particularly in March, there was a lot of heavy-up pantry loading, people buying particularly those brands where they have a lot of comfort. And of course many, many of our brands across beer, wine and spirits all fit into that. So, that was obviously very helpful. Keeping in mind that the Seltzer, much like Refresca did, goes into different space, and Seltzer has obviously been a very hot category. You see a lot of that product on the floor with us and with competitors as well. And we've already in just the first month, our team and our distributors have done an outstanding job of getting the product out to market. We've almost achieved 50%, ACV in the first month, which is again record speed. So, we think as time goes forward, you're going to continue to see core SKUs, critical SKUs being very important. And in fact, we have made some adjustments in our production footprint to make sure that those core SKUs are fully available throughout the supply chain because that's something that we think will occur in the near term, until consumers spend more time in stores. We've also seen a very rapid uptick in click, things like 3-tier e-commerce, click and collect. Our Company had its single biggest -- in wine, had our single biggest direct-to-consumer week we've ever had last week as consumers again found alternate ways to continue to buy our products. So, I think, just to summarize that, you're going to continue to see critical SKUs, be in stronger distribution positions. But we've been very pleased with our distributors\u2019 ability to continue to get critical new products. Remember, most of the new things that we're doing this year are master brand extensions. So, they are consistent and part of strong brand families. That particularly at a time like this, I think is important because the consumer often during recession or recessionary type behavior, seeks out those core brands that they have a lot of personal comfort with. And again, our brands fortunately are part of that set. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : So, I wanted to ask more of a longer term question. In past cycles, we've seen some trade down occur in the beer category in a recessionary environment, including back in 2008, 2009. Could you just spend some time discussing how your product portfolio might be more or less at risk from a macro slowdown versus past cycles on a theoretical basis, sort of ex the COVID situation, due to much higher share level today, your brand mix has changed over time. So, just curious for your perspective on the degree of trade down risk or macro sensitivity may be versus what you see in the past cycles? Bill Newlands : Yes. And I joked with Garth earlier today, I guess if you're old enough, you've been through a couple of these cycles. So, I have. What we expect to see is this. Brands are even more important at a time like this, because many people are seeing the opportunity -- and our category is one of those, for simple pleasures in life. Let's face it. The more people are sheltering in place, the more that they look for those small pleasures in life and our category is one of those that addresses that. But, you often see even stronger brand behavior that occurs during this time. So, let's take our Woodbridge wine brand example. We have seen significant pickup in the month of March for that brand because as I said in my script, it's a tried and true brand. People know it, they appreciate the quality for the price value relationship that exists there, and we've seen quite a bit of an uptick against that brand. We've seen the same thing with Kim Crawford, Meiomi and The Prisoner, brands that the consumer appreciates, and likes. Similarly, in beer, when you have a brand like Modelo that\u2019s the number four brand now in the entire U.S. beer business, you've got a brand that has a great deal of trust, and you're seeing the trends that support that. Fortunately, Modelo and Corona are two of the most trusted brands in the consumers\u2019 mind. And therefore, we feel very comfortable that we will actually get a disproportionate amount of benefit that occurs when people go to the more tried and true brands. That's what we saw in 2008, that's what we saw in the previous recession before that that those tried and true brands end up winning. And we think our brands are well-positioned across beer, wine and spirits to take advantage of that, just a little less experimentation during a recession environment, and that's why those core brands like ours will do very well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : My question was just continuing to going back to the conversation about Mexico production. If we do, in fact, get to place where you need to curtail production, even though there's no [Technical Difficulty], how should we think about [Technical Difficulty] margins, right? So you shut down the plant for a month, I would think you get a good amount of pressure on margins, but does that even out, when you ramp back up as you come out of this? So, just kind of thinking about very, very short-term question, but just trying to understand how we should think about that net impact on profitability? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Well, again, I'm going to repeat myself, but I hope you'll bear with me on it. We continue to operate in Mexico. And as long as that is a consistent statement and we expect that it will be, we wouldn't expect that there would be any significant issues around our margin structure. Obviously, a lot of things factor into that, not the least of which is, the peso and various other things that occur during times like this. But, I think the best way to think about it is, we have 70 plus days in the pipeline for our beer business and we expect to have no disruption in our ability to produce product and deliver it to retail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Kevin Grundy : Bill, I wanted to pick up on the on-premise, off-premise dynamic. I know, this is a difficult question to answer and I appreciate that you don't want to give guidance. But maybe even qualitatively, I think what a lot of investors are kind of wrestling with is how much of the unprecedented weakness in the on-premise channel is potentially going to be captured in the off-premise. And we've seen big pantry loading at this point, but really harder to make conclusions on what's going on in terms of how quickly consumers are going to -- will destock their pantries. So, any comments you have potentially on how much of the on-premise weakness will potentially be offset by the off-premise? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. You bet. Admittedly, this is somewhat unprecedented. So, I think we need to all be careful with specificity of answers because in other recessionary periods, while you saw decreases in the on-premise, you didn't have shutdown in the on-premise. So, it is a little different. With that said, channel shift is not unusual during recessionary times. And you're obviously seeing that now in part because the on-premise is in many markets is largely closed. Again, if you are in the 85% to 90% range for us and the off-premise to start with, the need to see some increase in channel shift is less significant than it is for someone who is more weighted to the on premise. Let's take March as an example. Admittedly, there was some pantry loading that occurred during that month. It more than made up -- the off-premise more than made up for the on-premise loss that occurred during that timeframe. It was an excellent month. But, we're always reticent to project that forward because you don't know what the consumption profile will be. I'll repeat what I said a minute ago, because I think it's a very true comment. People look for small pleasures in their life when you were in situations of recession. Multiply that by the fact that most of us are now sheltering in home. Those small pleasures -- our business is one of those small pleasures and I think that will be advantageous for our business going forward. Garth Hankinson : As long as around the on and off-premise question, let me just go back to clarify, Bryan's question around the growth rates related to on versus off-premise. Bryan, I gave you a bit of incomplete answer. So, what I gave you is zero on-premise growth and mid single digits. That was really for wine and spirits, as you think about their total sales being in that 2 to 4 range. On beer, total sales were targeting to be 8% to 10% on an organic basis. So, the on-premise would be in the sort of low to mid single digits and off-premise would be the remainder. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about how you may be adjusting your marketing spend, and what sort of flexibility you have on your contracts. Obviously, you do a lot with ESPN, a lot of sports, UFC and a lot of these events just aren't going to happen. So, is there -- maybe there's some kind of breakout that you can give us in terms of what is fixed for this year or let's say the calendar year, next 12 months, and what areas you can possibly save or redirect? Bill Newlands : This is also, as you would expect, a bit of a moving answer. Some things you've seen have been postponed. Therefore, we are not -- well, we may not spend it in the first quarter, we might well spend it when the events do occur, assuming they do. What we have done is that we have adjusted, Jim Sabia and his team in both wine spirits and in beer, have done a fair amount to move to more digital and social media efforts, which is actually good. That's very consistent with where the consumer is going anyway. So, we do have quite a bit of flexibility to move things around. When you have cancellations, let's take the NCAAs. That is a cancellation. So, choices are then made as to whether or not we reproportion that type of spend that we have into other formats, or we don't. Those decisions are ongoing. It\u2019d be difficult to give you a definitive answer at this point in time around that. We will try to do that going forward, as more thoroughly understand what is canceled versus what is delayed. Until we have a better handle on that, it\u2019d be very difficult. Suffice it to say, one of the traits that we've seen with our marketing group is to be very nimble, and they are being very nimble, adjusting on the fly to more digital and social environments from things where we can't do live sports, as you know. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : As a follow-up on the comments about the production in the Mexico in your discussions, Bill, with the Mexican government. In order to stay open, could you prove that your production facilities are safe enough to be made operational through the end of April? And then as a follow-up to the margin commentary, how much of your Mexican peso dominated costs are hedged at this point in light of the devaluation of the Mexican pesos? Bill Newlands : So, Garth, I'll take the first half of that. Let me just tell you some of the things we've done. And we've done this in the wine and spirits as well as beer. And I think it's important. As I said, our employees are our number one priority. We are testing for temperature as people enter our facilities. We are keeping social distancing in our facilities to make sure that people are safe. We have changed how we run shifts in our plants to make sure there are not overlaps of shifts, in case there are any issues that occur with people's health. So, we are doing everything humanly possible to make sure that we continue to operate in a safe and effective manner within all of our operating facilities. The same is true of that in New Zealand and Italy as well. So, first and foremost, we are taking great care to make sure we are operating correctly. I think that will likely be respected by the government of Mexico. They have obvious concerns for their entire economy, as our country has great concerns for our economy, to make sure that people are being protected. And I think the kind of steps that we're taking to make sure we're protecting our people, we believe is best in class. We're keeping track of everything possible to ensure the safety of our employees, and that effort will continue. Garth, do you want to touch on the second piece? Garth Hankinson : Sure, on the hedging piece. So, as it relates to both, commodities and on currency, we're -- for the current fiscal year, fiscal '21, we are hedged on both fronts, in excess of 80%. We are using this period of time as we see some movements on commodities and in currency to layer in additional hedges for the next couple years. So, we could see some further benefits in coming fiscal years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. You may proceed with your question? Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity. So, two follow-up questions actually. One, you said you will focus on the core brands going forward. And that makes sense. I\u2019d like to understand if Corona Seltzer is considered as a core brand and being -- will be one of your focus points for the next two months. That's one question. And the second follow-up, sorry to come back on this, manufacturing in Mexico. But, this morning again one of your competitors said that on Sunday April 5th Grupo Modelo will suspend beer production and distribution operations. So, as you've got 70 days of inventory, obviously you want to beat kind of goodwill with the Mexican government, I mean, on the Mexicali and brewery subset. So, why -- and there is something, I don't know understand it. Why are you -- have you decided to go against the government decision in that specific subject? Thank you. Bill Newlands : So, let's tackle your first question, which is seltzer. Certainly, our Corona brand family, since we approached 150 million cases of product in fiscal '20 is one of the critical things and critical brands that we have within our portfolio. The seltzer, as you know, is one of the fastest growing sub segments within the alcohol beverage business, as well. Therefore, the combination of the great Corona branding, plus the hot category of seltzer is a wonderful combination. And we're expecting that that's going to be important part of our success story for fiscal '21. I do need to be very, very clear with you. We are not doing anything against what the government of Mexico is suggesting. We certainly -- our company is known for respecting, respectful of the laws and approaches of any company -- any country in which we operate. And that certainly will continue. I have no comment regarding a competitor and what they are choosing to do or not choosing to do. I personally would suggest you ask them. What I would say is today, currently, we are operating and we will continue to do what's appropriate under the restrictions that apply or don't apply in any company -- in any country in which we operate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. You may proceed with your question. Bill Kirk : Thank you, everyone. So, on the 70 days of inventory in the system, how much of that is in Mexico? I guess, that'll show up in a 10-K, but how much of it is in Mexico and how much of that is actually allowed to leave Mexico and into the United States? Is that allowed to come over the border right now? Bill Newlands : So, to answer your question, the vast majority of that answers in the United States between either inventory at our distributors or in our DCs. So, the vast majority of it I would say, in excess of 80% of that is already in the United States. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. You may proceed with your question. Bill Chappell : I just want to go back to Mexicali. And I understand you can't talk about where it goes from here. But can you maybe give us an update on how much money has been put into it? And then, any kind of color on how you've got this far down the path and we got to this stage? Garth Hankinson : Yes. I'll take the first part of that. To-date, we have spent approximately a $700 million in Mexicali. Bill Newlands : So, what I would say is that there are a lot of decisions that have been made as time has gone on. As you know, there have been changes in government during the time that this facility has been started. What I would say is this. We've been operating in Mexico for 30 years. It has been a tremendous partnership with the people of Mexico and with the government of Mexico and with the local States within Mexico. We remain extremely confident in our long-term ability to meet the consumer needs in the United States for the critical brands of Modelo, Corona, Pacifico, and other related brands. So, I don't feel that it does anyone any good to micromanage the approach to the situation. What I would say is we're going to have a very solid solution for our long-term prospects and we certainly appreciate the government's engagement with us on that topic. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Sean King : Hi. Thanks for the question. I got a wine sale question. Is it safe to say that the escalating COVID-related work stoppages and disruptions could have an impact on the, I guess, achievability of the new timing, or is that already baked into your new outlook? Garth Hankinson : So, thank you for the question. We think that the COVID situation is baked into the current timeline. That being said, I don't know how much more disruption COVID-19 could have in terms of the government's ability to work. But I can tell you right now that the FTC continues to be actively engaged in our conversations and in the review of this process. And, we\u2019ve factored all of that into the timeline that we provided. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any further remarks. Bill Newlands : I'd just like to thank everyone for joining our call today, particularly in these challenging times. I believe we've done an excellent job of building vital momentum in fiscal '20 as we head into what admittedly will be a volatile start to our new fiscal year. Through our strategic initiatives and priorities, we are positioning Constellation for sustained long-term success and will continue to quickly adapt to the rapidly changing market dynamics as we navigate through fiscal \u201821. As the environment evolves, and more factors become known over the next few months, we hope to be able to provide much more clarity on the prospects for our business for the year in which we are in. I'd like to thank you all again for joining the call. And I hope you and your loved ones remain healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I\u2019m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here\u2019s Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call, everyone. Before getting into a discussion of our quarterly results, I'd like to address two topics that have become extremely relevant to our business and our society in large. First, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been impacted by racial injustice and associated acts of violence in both this most recent time period and throughout the years. We stand in solidarity with the black community, and our belief that black lives do, in fact, and have always mattered. We categorically denounce bigotry, racism, social injustice and acts of senseless violence in all forms. They are clearly inconsistent with our company values and our commitment to embracing diversity and creating an inclusive environment for all employees feel safe, respected and valued. Earlier this week, we announced our commitment to invest $100 million to support African-American black and minority-owned startups in the beverage alcohol space and related categories over the next 10 years. These small businesses serve as the fabric of their respective communities. And we must make it more equitable for them to access the capital needed to have a fighting chance at success. In addition, we've made a $1 million commitment over five years to the Equal Justice Initiative and their efforts to educate the public about the history of racial and justice in this country and to support their quest for equity in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, we've made a commitment within our company to enhance representation and access to opportunity for black team members at Constellation by strengthening our recruiting, hiring and development programs. The conditions that have allowed systemic racial injustice to persist have existed far too long. We all have a role to play in creating a more equitable experience for African-Americans in this country, and we are committed to doing our part to make this happen. Switching gears, our organization has responded and adapted to the challenges of the COVID-19 operating environment in an incredible and agile manner, which is reflected in our results for the first quarter. I'm especially proud of the efforts of the Constellation team members, of our distributors and our retail partners who work together to ensure our customers' needs were met under very challenging circumstances. As I've said before, the health and well-being of our employees is our number one priority and we've taken a number of preventative measures to keep them safe in our operations and out at retail to ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of the market. We've provided support and relief to our customers and our channel partners by donating more than $4 million in COVID-19 relief efforts and by donating PPE and sanitizer produced in our own facilities. Bottom-line, I'm extremely proud of the way our team and industry partners have risen to the occasion, and I remain confident our business and our brands will emerge even stronger on the other side. Now, let's transition to a discussion of our performance in the quarter. As Garth and I run through the highlights, there are three key points I'd like you to take away. Number one, despite various headwinds, we delivered solid first quarter business performance and strong cash flow generation. We are winning in sales channels that are open. Beer depletions remain strong and consistent with long-term trends despite the lost selling day in the quarter and the virtual shutdown of on-premise sales. And our wine and spirit power brands continued to gain traction. Number two, the slowdown of our beer production in Mexico due to COVID impacted shipments and net sales in Q1, and this impact will extend into Q2 as well. We will make up some of that impact in the back half of the year as our beer production in Mexico has returned to normal levels. Number three, this short-term disruption to our import beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects. Consumer demand and takeaway for our brands remains extremely strong, and our outlook for the year and over the long-term remains extremely bright. Now, let's talk more specifically about our about our performance in the first quarter, starting with our beer business. Imports continue to be one of the primary growth contributors in the high end and total U.S. beer market, with Constellation delivering more than 80% of that import growth, driven by the Modelo Especial and Corona brand families. Solid first quarter depletion trends of 7% adjusted for one less selling day were driven by strong off-premise growth of almost 20%, due to the grocery and C-store channels, offset by a drag from the closure of the on-premise channel, which was down about 75% year-over-year. This is excellent performance considering that the country really began to feel the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in earnest in early March, which coincided with the beginning of our fiscal year and our brands over-index to densely populated states, such as New York and California that have been significantly impacted for a prolonged period of time. One of the highlights of the quarter was the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer. As expected, the brand name Corona drove extremely good trial of Corona Hard Shelter, and the great taste profile is driving a repeat purchase intent of almost 80%, which exceeded our expectations. Corona Hard Seltzer is already the number four hard seltzer brand and recently achieved IRI market share of almost 6% of the U.S. seltzer market. Ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 65% since product launched in March, with early results for Corona Hard Seltzer, incrementality, trending at around 90%, also exceeding our original expectations. We're also seeing high Hispanic penetration rates for the brand versus other Hard Seltzers, which we believe will be a key growth driver going forward and a major point of differentiation within the fast-growing demographic in this country. We believe the refreshment attributes of seltzer, combined with the halo effect of the Corona brand, which remains one of the most loved beer brands, provides an opportunity to build one of the strongest Hard Seltzer brands in our industry. During the quarter, we kicked off the summer selling season and gained share during the Memorial Day and Cinco de Mayo holidays. Cinco is a great example of changing consumer behavior during the pandemic, when people enjoyed our great brands in Cinco celebrations at home. As a result, our Cinco performance increased two to three times, what we would normally see in the off-premise. Our beer portfolio contributed nearly 20% of total U.S. beer category growth during Cinco and claimed four of the top 20 share gaining brand in IRI channels, driven by Modelo Especial as the top share gaining non-seltzer beer brand, Corona Hard Seltzer, Pacifico and Modelo Chelada, Limon y Sal. As previously mentioned, we have returned to normal production levels at our breweries in Mexico. During the mandated production slowdown in the quarter due to COVID-19, our focus on prioritizing production of our top-selling SKUs, which represent about 75% of total volume helped minimize disruption at retail, while supporting our efforts to ensure consumers could find our brands on the shelf and in the cold box. While supply will continue to be tight on select slower moving SKUs throughout the remainder of the summer, due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands in the off-premise, we expect to return to normal inventory levels in the third quarter. Let's now move to quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business, which experienced the same market dynamics as our beer business during the quarter, with strong demand in the off-premise, offset by a decline in the on-premise of almost 80%. We continued to see staying power of the premiumization trend with premium price segments continuing to outpace value price segments, further reinforcing our Wine & Spirits business strategy. In fact, we saw excellent consumer takeaway trends of over, 25% for our Power Brands in the IRI off-premise channels during the quarter. Our Power Brands are winning in the high end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S, wine category, with strong velocity and distribution gains that are outpacing the market. First Quarter depletions for our collection of Power Brands grew 5%, driven by Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA, The Prisoner brand family and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. We continue to invest in additional ways to fuel portfolio growth through innovation, capitalizing on priority, consumer trends, with successful product introductions, like the Prisoner unshackled Ruffino organic Prosecco and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay, all of which are performing well in the marketplace. As you know, some of our biggest success stories and innovation have come from the spirit barrel age category, where we currently enjoy a 40% market share. The newest addition to this portfolio comes from the Woodbridge family, where we're seeing early success from the Bourbon barrel-aged Cabernet and Red Blend, as well as the rum barrel-aged Chardonnay. You should expect to see continuing premium category leading innovation from us as we emerge from the COVID environment, including line extensions for Meiomi in the Cabernets space, and from The Prisoner Brand Family with the addition of Cabernet and Chardonnay neighbor islands. In the Spirits category, you'll see SVEDKA pure infusions, as well as High West and SVEDKA premix cocktail in the RTD space. We continue to invest in capabilities that position, our Wine & Spirits business for long-term success. As a result of sheltering in place restrictions and the shutdown of on-premise accounts due to COVID-19, eCommerce for beverage alcohol has exploded, increasing three to seven times in volume versus prior year, depending on the channel. Consumer awareness for eCommerce and beverage alcohol has significantly increased and accelerated change in consumer behaviors by several years. With two-thirds of consumers saying they are planning to continue their eCommerce habits post-COVID, eCommerce is gaining share through platforms like Instacart, Drizly and other retailer online sites as consumers seek the convenience of these channels. In line with this accelerated trend, we acquired Empathy Wines in June. This acquisition fits in nicely with our broader premiumization strategy and strengthens our position in the direct-to- consumer, and three-tier eCommerce channel, where we'll utilize Empathy\u2019s digitally native platform to reach new as well as thousands of existing loyal consumers. In addition, Empathy focus on producing high quality sustainably made wines sold direct to consumer from its winery via its eCommerce platform at the $20 price point in three variants, like Blend, Red Blend and Roget launched in 2019 the brand has sold approximately 15,000 cases and acquire more than 2,000 subscription customers. We are already a leading player in three-tier eCommerce and have seen growth in this channel of more than 500% in the last three months. We plan to leverage this acquisition, as an opportunity to strengthen our position and outpace the market. As you know, we recently revised the Gallo transaction to exclude our Mission Bell facility as the FTC wanted to ensure that we have adequate production capability for our J. Roget and Cooks brands, which we decided to retain once they were excluded from the original transaction. We're also one step closer to the finish line on this transaction with the signing of separate agreements to sell Nobilo New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy. As you will recall in December, we entered into a separate pub-related agreement with Gallo to divest our Nobilo brand for 130 million. This fits with Gallo\u2019s portfolio strategy and allows them to expand in the New Zealand wine category without affecting our long-term goals nor our opportunity in this category at the greater than $11 price point. In addition, we've signed an agreement to sell Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy to Sazerac for $255 million. As a reminder, last December, we announced the Paul Masson had been excluded from the original transaction due to FTC concerns and we indicated that we were pursuing opportunities to divest this brand at that time. These transactions are subject to final FTC review and they are expected to close in the second quarter, concurrent with or closely following the close of the Gallo transaction. All proceeds will primarily be used to reduce debt. Finally, we continue to be encouraged by steps David Klein and the Canopy team are taking to position the company to win in key markets and product categories over the long-term. The business continues to work through its transformational strategy with a leaner approach that will allow Canopy to be more flexible and adapt more quickly to changes in this dynamic cannabis market. Canopy has seen early success from its Rec 2.0 products in the Canadian cannabis market, including beverages, which we are very excited about. The company's Tweed and Houndstooth brand has been one of the most raved about cannabis beverages in the market with overwhelmingly positive consumer feedback. We believe that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to the market and further drive conversation -- excuse me conversion from the illicit market. We continue to believe that Canopy remains best position to win long-term in the emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face the challenges associated with this current economic environment. As I close, let me again reiterate the three main takeaways from this forum. First, despite various headwinds, we've delivered a solid first quarter business performance and strong cash flow generation. We are winning in the sales channels that are open. Beer depletions remain strong and consistent with our growth outlook for the future, despite the less selling day in the quarter and the virtual shutdown of on-premise sales and our Wine & Spirits Power Brands continued to gain traction. Number two, the slowdown of our beer production in Mexico due to COVID impacted shipments and net sales in Q1 and this impact will extend into Q2 as well. We will make up some of that impact beginning in the third quarter as our beer production in Mexico has returned to normal levels. And number three, this short-term disruption to our import beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects. Consumer demand and take away from our brand remains extremely strong and I remain optimistic about our outlook for this year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results for the first quarter. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill and hello everyone. Well, the start with our fiscal year marked the beginning of a global pandemic, resulting in rapidly changing market conditions, Constellation Brands delivered solid performance in Q1, driven by our ability to remain agile and prudently navigate through these uncertain and volatile times. During Q1, we improve margins and both our Beer, Wine & Spirits segments delivered solid Beer and Wine & Spirits Power Brand depletion volume trends, due to strong brand performance despite closures in the on-premise channel and shelter-in-place guidelines that impacted a majority of the quarter and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 16% and 24%, respectively. These strong cash flow results provide us with the financial flexibility needed to continue to focus on debt pay-down and liquidity. During the quarter, we were able to issue debt at very favorable rates and use the proceeds to satisfy $700 million of debt coming due in November, and pay down other near term maturities. Now, let's review Q1 performance in more detail. We're all generally focused on capital basis, financial results, starting with Beer. Net sales declined 6%, excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales declined at 4% and organic shipment volume down 6% partially offset by favorable pricing. Q1 shipment volume was negatively impacted by reduced production levels at our breweries in Mexico, as part of COVID-19 safety measures. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in at 5.6%, driven by Modelo Especial, and the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer a strong performance in the off-premise channel, more than offset the impact of the reduction in the on-premise channel, due to COVID-19 related shutdowns. When adjusted for one less selling day in the quarter, the Beer business generated nearly 7% of depletion volume growth and impressive result in this operating environment.  A large gap between shipment and depletion volume trends for Q1 was driven by the reduced production levels for roughly two-thirds of the quarter and robust consumer demand. This resulted in lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. I'm happy to report and reiterate that beer production in Mexico return to normal levels in June, and we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the third quarter of our fiscal year, as some shipment volume shifts from Q1 and Q2 into Q3. Beer gross margin of 55.6% was flat the prior year, it\u2019s favorable pricing and the benefit of the Ballast Point divestiture was offset by increased operational cost driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at our breweries resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption. Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%, as marketing spend decreased due to the implications of COVID-19, essentially canceling and/or postponing most sporting and sponsorship events. With most sports programming on hold during Q1, and big events, such as the NCAA Basketball Tournament cancelled, in the short-term we are reallocating marketing dollars to lower cost digital marketing efforts and TV programming that consumers are engaging with in this current environment. We are recalibrating our marketing spend and strategy for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, currently we still expect to spend in the range of 9.5% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis. As such, the marketing related margin benefit in Q1 is mostly related to timing. As a result of the abovementioned factors, beer operating margins increased 240 basis points to 41.7%. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect shipment volume to be negatively impacted, as we ramp back to normal production levels in June. Keep in mind that we expect to see some residual margin compression in Q2 as the reduced production levels in Q1 and the start of Q2 will create unfavorable fixed cost absorption, which is expected to continue to work its way through the Beer business results during Q2. Moving to Wine & Spirits Power Brand depletion volume accelerated and achieve 5% growth as these brands continue to win in higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. Wine category. Overall depletion wine declined 1% reflecting the impact of the brands to be divested. Net sales declined 7% and shipment volume down 13%. Decline in net sales was driven by the following : lower volume and unfavorable comparison to Q1 prior year, due to a very strong quarter last year for the brands to be divested; on-premise and retail tasting room closures throughout most of the quarter as a result of COVID-19 and net sales of the Black Velvet brands are not included in this year's Q1 as a result of its divestiture late last year. The decline in net sales is an improvement from our Q1 pre-COVID targets we provided for the Wine & Spirits business during our last sales and earnings call driven by the strength of some of our fast moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi and SVEDKA, and an improvement in some of the -- in some of the brands to be divested such as Black Box and Paul Masson, which saw accelerated and robust consumer takeaway trends during Q1. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales declined at 4%, reflecting shipment volume decline of 9%, partially offset by strong price and mix benefits in the quarter. Operating margin increased 240 basis points to 28.3% as benefits from Price Index, along with favorable SG&A were partially offset by the Black Velvet divestiture and higher COGS. In Q1, we saw the benefits of shipment volume mix driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. In addition, we saw lower promotion expense as scheduled incentive programming activities did not occur due to the current operating environment and COVID-19 related closures for the on-premise. While we expect to continue to see positive price and mixed benefits the remainder of our fiscal year, they should temper versus the very strong price and mixed results we saw in Q1. Depletion in shipment volume for our power brands is expected to temper in Q2, as we do not plan to replicate some lower return incentive programs that ran during our Q2 fiscal 2020. However, we plan to shift some programming resources for these brands the back half of the year to better align with timing for our key selling season for our Wine & Spirits business. In addition, we are assuming a Q2 close for the Gallo and other divestiture transactions, which will negatively impact the quarter. Therefore, we are expecting decline of 25% to 30% in reported Wine & Spirits sales and operating income for Q2. Q1 corporate expenses came in an approximately $51 million, up 16% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased approximately 13% to $100 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 19.3% versus 18.6% last year, primarily driven by lower level of stock based compensation benefits this year. Moving to free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $542 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This represents an impressive 24% increase. Cash flow improvements reflect strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $144 million or 7% below last year spend. This included approximately $110 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by the five million hectoliter expansion project at our Obregon Brewery. While COVID-19 safety precautions slowed expansion activities at our Obregon Brewery during Q1, construction activities are ramping back up. And we expect the five million hectoliter addition to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. Let me remind you that with the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at Nava and Obregon to meet consumer needs over the medium-term. Moving to Canopy, in Q1, we recognized a $197 million decrease in the fair value of Canopy investments. These impacts were excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $112 million. On May 1st, we exercised the original warrants with Canopy for $174 and increased our ownership position by approximately 3% to 38.6%. The warrants were in the money, and the amount was manageable from a liquidity and leverage standpoint. We continue to believe in the long-term and substantial opportunity in the emerging cannabis market and remain confident that Canopy is best positioned to win in this space. As a reminder, the expiration of future and much larger warrant tranches were extended to calendar years 2020, 2023 and 2026. We will evaluate the exercise of each of these warrants prior to expiration as we continue to see how the cannabis industry unfolds in both Canada and the U.S. Furthermore, we do not plan to make any additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the potential exercise of these warrants. Now let's shift the discussion to outlook and guidance. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year and given the related uncertainty volatility and fast moving developments that have evolved during the first quarter of our fiscal year, we still do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. However, let me take a moment to reiterate that in a normalized environment, our medium-term growth algorithm remains unchanged for both our Beer and Wine & Spirits segments. This is a good spot to discuss our capital allocation strategy. While we remain focused on our goal of returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in the short-term, given the uncertainty of the current environment, we will be focusing on maximizing free cash flow and utilizing that free cash to reduce debt and leverage, creating the flexibility needed to fulfill our $4.5 million commitment longer term. As a result, we are moving this goal out to cover the fiscal 2020 to 2023 time frame and the total cash return in the form of dividends and share repurchases to approximately $5 billion as we add another year of dividends into the mix. In closing, I want to reiterate that our cash generation profile remains strong, our quarterly dividend rate has been maintained, and we remain focused on actively and prudently navigating through the challenging environment presented by COVID-19, and we look to provide updates as more factors become known. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Hey good morning everyone. Bill Newlands : Hey Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So, I guess a question on the wine business and maybe just two related. One was -- I think you took some price increases earlier this year on Woodbridge and be some other brands. So, I just wanted to see how the market reacted to that? Whether you feel like you were able to successfully get those price increases through? And then maybe related, there was some repositioning that you were planning to do in the wine business this year from a brand positioning and marketing increases. And I just want to understand if that's actually happening, if you can still do that in this current environment? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure, you bet. So we did in fact, take price increase on Woodbridge and I must say one of the things that has been a benefit of COVID is that if there are any, is that consumers have continued to buy tried and true brands of which Woodbridge is one. And it was certainly helpful that we put our price through concurrently with that and Woodbridge has actually been outperforming our expectations around the pricing increase throughout the first quarter. So, so far, so good. We\u2019re going to continue to watch that as you would expect, but so far that's gone very well. I would also say that some of the new product introductions that we have put into Woodbridge have performed and we're expecting to continue to perform very well. That's a very important brand for us. A lot of the work that we're doing more broadly around our brands is continuing. We've seen a tremendous increase in direct-to-consumer and three Tier commerce, which goes very well to strong brands like the prisoner and may owe me and brands of that elk. So we\u2019re going to continue to put focus on those brands. We think they're very well positioned and those brands are tried and true brands in the mind of the consumer, which at the moment is where the consumer is spending their dollars. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I had a question on out of stocks. It's a key summer holiday this week with the force, so hoping you guys could share with us how you feel specifically about the holiday and your supply? Also, maybe love to hear some more color on what you're doing to minimize the disruption for out of stocks? For instance, I've heard from some of the distributors that you're doing drop loads. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from you how flexible you can be on the production side with all of this and then maybe finally can you touch on how big of a drag some of these shortages and may be any initiatives you might be taking to minimize the situation. How big of a drag it might be on your margins, if at all? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Let's start with -- our belief is that our operations team is best-in-class. And we are doing everything we can do at the moment to expedite shipments from our breweries, true our distribution facilities and through our distributors to consumers. Certainly, because of the reduced production that occurred during about 70 plus days, mostly in the first quarter, it\u2019s certainly reduced our ability to ship to normal levels. But let's keep in mind, the demand for our brands for Modelo and Corona have never been stronger. We were up almost 20% in the off-premise channel during the quarter. And we're seeing consistent depletion levels as we start Q2 as well. So we are in a very strong position. Keep also in mind that during the mandated COVID-19 reduction in production, we produced the SKUs primarily that led to 75% of our sales. So, while a consumer may or may not be able to buy a particular SKU, in all likelihood, we would expect that a person who wants to buy Modelo or Corona and the brand families associated with those will be able to buy those during the holidays. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open. Nik Modi : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. So Bill, I know that, obviously, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. The question is -- I think, the top question most investors have is -- how long what the growth curve for the beer business will look like -- not only next six months, but next two, three years? So, I was hoping maybe you can provide some context on the following three points, right? One is -- number of new households or trial surge that you've seen and repeat rates on those new trials that you've seen since this whole pandemic started? The second point would be -- I understand the out of stock situation you are able actually provide products and maybe some packages weren't found, but I'm sure that out of stocks did cost you some sale. So I am just curious, maybe you can help -- can provide some context on how much the business would have grown on depletion had there been no issue in out of stocks at all. And then the third point is, obviously, retailers are thinking -- rethinking how they think about the shelf, something you guys have been doing for the last two to three years now. And so how you think this environment might shape or accelerate some of your Shopper-First initiatives and more spacing for your brands and retail longer term? Bill Newlands : Sure. So let's take it in reverse order. Relative to the shelf, obviously, the one thing that's occurred during this particular timeframe is some of the resets that would normally occur have been pushed back as many retailers are focusing their attention on throughput from their existing shelf sets. We think that as they come into the fall season and do fall resets that this will continue to increase the probability of Shopper-First. Because I think it\u2019s became more and more clear that brands that are -- that have strong demand behind them and ours are two great examples with the Modelo and Corona franchises are far demanding more space, and they're demanding more space because the takeout is there against them. It's kind of difficult to give you a specific example about what we could have grown because you had so many different factors involved in the quarter. You know our quarter of course, started almost concurrent with the pandemic, which was a little different than if you were on the calendar quarter, admittedly. But when you look at the fact that on-premise was effectively closed, but off-premise was up almost 20%, you know, you've got a lot of different dynamics in play there.  As I said earlier, we sincerely believe that the consumer wanting to buy our brands will be able to buy Corona and Modelo. And certainly, the start of Corona Hard Seltzer has also been a real success. We have already shipped in access of 3 million cases of Corona Hard Seltzer. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the takeaway and repeat has been exceptional. So one of the things we are seeing relative to your first question in terms of consumer purchasing. About 30-some-odd percent of consumers are actually increasing their consumption of those brands that they are traditionally using. And given the strong representation of our brands, Corona, Modelo, in particular, it's not surprising that you've seen an increase in the takeout demand during this time frame. It goes back to what I said earlier about tried and true brands. The same would apply to many of our Wine & Spirits brands as well. But certainly the consumer's interest in buying brands in which they have a lot of faith and comfort is working to our advantage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open. Vivien Azer : Hi. Thank you. Garth, I was wondering -- thanks for the color in terms of the marketing spend outlook. I was wondering if you could offer any color on how you're thinking about phasing that and whether we might expect something different as you kind of lean into a post-COVID recovery perhaps? And then, a quick follow-up. Bill, I really appreciated your comments at the start of the call and I'm curious whether you guys are accessing any change to your social media advertising spend? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Vivien. Thanks for the question. As it relates to marketing spend and the phasing of that, I'd say, it's still too early to tell exactly what that will know, as we sort of come out of COVID-19 and we don\u2019t know exactly when some of these sponsorships and sporting events might get rescheduled. So other that we still believe that we\u2019re going to spend in that 9.5% to 10% of net sales for the full year, the phasing is still a little bit up in the air. Bill Newlands : So relative to social media, there's obviously been a lot of discussion around social media. I would say and let me reiterate what I said earlier. We think it's very important to protect users for disinformation and hate-speech. Those things run directly counter to our commitment to social justice and to racial equality. We have decided that we are going to do a comprehensive review of our social media work and along with that for the month of July we are pausing our Facebook engagement until we are able to do a thorough review and to make sure that all of our social media efforts match up with what I just said, which is the commitment to social justice and racial equality. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just one point of clarification and then my question. Just can you just break out the price/mix in the quarter and maybe separate out headline pricing from promos? And then, my main question really is unbelievable growth, right, in the seltzer category. You're now in the mix, big time with Corona Seltzer which, I think, you said is 90% incremental. What have you learned about the category now year-to-date and how big do you think it can be as a percentage of overall beer sales? And is your latest thought in terms incrementality to the entire beer category at this point? Thank you. Bill Newlands : So, relative to those two or three questions in that, we continue to have our long-term algorithm, particularly as it relates to beer, of expecting that price will grow 1% to 2% annually. We've done that consistently over time and we expect that that algorithm is going to continue. The relative to seltzer, earlier this year, we said we thought the category, which was roughly 60 million cases last year, could double and probably triple in the long run. If anything, that's starting to look conservative. The consumer certainly enjoys the refreshment characteristics of this particular category. And I think our introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer is a great example of leveraging a tremendously strong brand, into a new category. I think it would be important to not simply lump seltzer in with beer. Given the incrementality that we've seen is roughly 90%, which again is more than we frankly expected, suggests to us that it is not necessarily a direct trade-off with beer. And I think that it has category dynamics that are free and understanding of the role. So, our view is that this continues to have a lot of longevity. And we are certainly planning to be a critical part of it. As you know, we've already gotten to number four in the category with a roughly 6% share. And as you also know, we've just warming up. Rob Ottenstein : Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I was hoping that you guys could give us a little bit of help on the gross margin range of this quarter. And particularly in beer I am curious across those businesses. I know you mentioned that, you'll see some of start going into Q2 of the lower production volumes. And anything maybe just a little bit of visibility on the drivers of gross margin quarter and thinking about how that develops into 2Q it could be really helpful. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Bill, you? Bill Newlands : Yes. So, gross margins per beer is what we had some drags there, as it relates to materials and to fixed overhead absorption. That drag was offset by finding balance point divestiture, as well as by pricing. Going forward into Q2, we expect that there will be further downward margin pressure as it relates to fixed overhead absorption as we work through the inventory or the slowdown that we had in Q1 at the very beginning of Q2. At gross margin, they were flattish gross margin and beer. That resulted in about 240 basis points of improvement at the operating line because of primarily the timing of the marketing spend that we talk about earlier. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is open. Sean King : Thanks for the question. I apologize if I missed this. But do you provide any update on Mexicali? And, I guess, the potential options you're exploring there? Bill Newlands : We continue to be in discussions with the Mexican government about what our long-range plans are for Mexico. As you know, and as we've stated, based on the expansions that we already have in play our medium-term is already set. We believe there's going to be plenty of opportunity. And we spend more than 30 years working very well with the Mexican governments, both local and federally. And we expect that to continue and we expect to have a strong long-range solution for our continuing supply for the long run. So I don't have anything new to report on Mexicali other than to say, we fully expect to be able to service our needs for the long run. Operator : Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your mind is open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good afternoon guys. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : First, just a clarification, you mentioned depletion levels in Q2 in beer so far consistent with Q1. Is that versus the reported 5.6% depletion result or is that more 7% on a days adjusted basis? And then just on Corona Hard Seltzer, with the strong repeat rates you mentioned, can you give us a sense for what share level you think that brand can ultimately reach within the Hard Seltzer category and also what distribution level, it'd be reasonable to expect that brand to get to? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Let's, let's start with the hard Seltzer question. We already are seeing ACV distribution IRI channels of approximately 65, which, which is very strong, especially given the fact that as I said earlier, many retailers are not doing the resets that they had planned for the earlier part of this year. It remains to be seen what our -- what our long-term, scenario looks like. We're already about 6%. As you know, we've only introduced so far in variety pack. We would expect to extend beyond just variety pack, later this year and into the following years. So we're very optimistic that we're going to have a -- an important part of the Seltzer category, and certainly would expect to be in the top three, overall within that category, going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on the strong quarter. Just to follow up on the last question, I'm not sure there was there's clarity on where depletions were running for Q2, if it was close to the 7% on a selling day adjusted basis. So clarity there I think would be helpful for folks? And then more broadly, maybe you can just comment on the biggest variables impacting your decision to withhold guidance and the context being particularly strong starts at a year, sounds like June is off to a good start. Bill, you commented the portfolio has never been stronger. We're seeing that in really strong Nielsen data, production is ramping it breweries. You've had the strong start to the second quarter, commodity is still relatively benign, enough competence to deploy some cash towards small wine deal. We are kind of putting this all together.  And then in addition, the company is obviously very definitely managing through this very sharp and unprecedented channel shift. So with all of that said, comment on the biggest swing factors here that, leave the company a little bit reluctant to provide guidance at this point? So thanks for all that. Bill Newlands : Okay. Thank you. I might quote some of you. Some of those things that you just said that was quite nice. Relevant, you know first of all, I need to apologize for Dara, I did not answer the same question a minute ago and I apologize for that. Relative to depletions, our view is, is that -- that the second quarter specifically starting in June is looking fairly consistent with what the non-adjusted amount would be. And the takeout continues to be strong. All you have to do is look at IRI and Nielsen every week and you see that the take out is strong.  Here's the issue around guidance, if anybody would have said in February that we would have gone through what we just went through over the course of a quarter, you wouldn't have believed us. And while -- excuse me, on-premise was off 75% in the first quarter, a little more actually in wine and spirits. You started to see some openings, which saw a decrease to an off sort of 40% plus for a brief period of time. Now, we're turning around and we're seeing closures, again, in Arizona and Texas and Florida. So it is very difficult in this particular environment to be able to predict. What we are anxiously looking for, and I would suggest that all of you would want to look for is, how are brands performing, given there are going to be spits and spurts in the marketplace. And our brands continue to perform extremely well. There's going to be a lot of volatility this year, and ability to predict is very challenging admittedly. But I think those brands that are try and true that have strong consumer pull and demand. As I stated earlier, we are seeing a significant portion of our existing consumer base buying more than they had done historically. That speaks to strong brands. And I think that when we are through this pandemic scenario that has been very hard to predict, we believe we will be right back on our longer-term beer sales trends of 7% to 9% growth, which is what I'm sure many of you are interested in, and certainly, every all saying, point to the fact that our long-term algorithm is unchanged. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon. I have a question and a clarification. On the question, can you give us an idea of the cadence of the beer depletions for the quarter? Especially U.S. in May and now in June, I think you, Bill you said, the kind of the 5% to 6% would be the -- the non-adjusted number for June, but I was wondering what happened in the previous quarter. And then that June is probably because you went out and the stock-outs that you mentioned before. And if you can give us an idea of the 75% decline in terms of the cadence that you had. I'm assuming that would be much worse in May than it was in the beginning of the quarter that would be helpful? And the clarification on the wine guidance for the second quarter, you said sales and EBIT down -- Garth said, down 25% on a year-over-year basis. Is that an organic number or you corporate some of the impact of the divestitures closing during the quarter? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So, I will take the second part of the -- I will take the Wine & Spirits of that first. So, the down 25% to 30% really does take into account largely the wine divestiture. We didn't expect -- since we're now anticipating or expecting to flow that in our Q2, we're not expecting to shift much of the divested brands during our Q2, and then furthermore, we are expecting on our Power Brands to have depletions slightly down as we don't -- as we don't replicate some promotional and shipping activity that really was non-productive. Bill Newlands : And going back to your question about, how we think about the month. I think your question is a perfect example of why we have not given guidance because it is very, very difficult to predict. I mean, in the beginning of March, on-premise looked fairly normal. But the time we\u2019ve got to the end of the quarter, the first quarter, it was up 75%. I mean, as good as Garth is at predicting, he couldn't have predicted that. So -- and now we are seeing some market places going back to closures or to significantly reduce volume in restaurants and pub scenarios. So, it is just very challenging for us to put exact number and how it's going to follow, if you could tell me how the pandemic would play out, we could give you a much better answer. But as we see on almost a daily basis on -- on the news, it's impossible to predict exactly what the pandemic is going to do, which is why we continue to go back to the scenario that says, we have extremely strong brands, and our brands are outperforming in the marketplace and in the channels that are open to us, and that's how we will continue to judge our success. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the marketing spends and trying to understand how you're looking at it, as you said, some events like the NCAA tournament have been canceled. There could be a case where you're advertising at the World Series and the NBA Championship at the same time. So, how do you look at the spend for the back half of the year, especially around sports spending, when a lot of it's going to concur and it seems like it would be very duplicative to advertise all over the place? Bill Newlands : Well, you're right. It's more challenging than it would usually be. And as Garth pointed out in his remarks, the first quarter was a great example as there were a lot of live events and many of the things on which we normally advertise, like using the NBA as an example, just didn't exist. So, we are going to be focused in real-time on where we can implement our marketing spend. What I think is most important overall, as Garth noted, we still expect to spend between 9% and 10% on our marketing of our brands. When you look at historical results of companies that continued to spend in recessions, and admittedly, we're in one, or we're about to be in one. Those companies that continued to support their brands came out the back end even stronger. We believe in that and we are going to continue to spend. As you pointed out, that will mean some real time adjustments as we go. Because, admittedly, it's been very tough to predict what will in fact occur and when it will occur as you\u2019re seeing with things like the baseball schedule, which has moved all over the place in terms of number of games and how they're actually going to exercise those. Same is true in basketball; same is true in many of the live activity. So the reality is we will be doing this in real time. But it doesn't change our intent, which is we\u2019re going to spend against our brands to make sure they are top of mind in the consumer's view. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, thanks. Actually, I want to pick up on that train of thought, in terms of just an update on how you're assessing any implications of recessionary economic conditions on your categories and brands. I mean, so far, as you highlighted, the premiumization trends have continued nicely. So, but do you see any risk coming -- of that coming under pressure, even if temporary whether in beer or Wine & Spirits and just what are you watching most closely, keep tabs on that as conditions developed? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Certainly. As you would expect, we watch things like unemployment rates. We are overdeveloped, as you know with the Hispanic community and the unemployment rates in the Hispanic community have been significantly higher than the average unemployment rates in the in the marketplace today, although all of its in double-digits. So, so that's something that we watch very carefully. Again, it's the same point, the brand awareness, brand loyalty of our brands within those communities are very strong. But we watch those things very, very carefully. Certainly, one of the other things that you see, and I think it's been exacerbated in the pandemic because of people sheltering is people look for those small moments of joy in their lives. And fortunately, our brands can often offer those to people. So, we think that the strength of our brands in conjunction with people engaging more at home than they would naturally and normally do, will be important to the continued success of our business, albeit, we're watching a lot of those characteristics like unemployment very carefully. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet : Good morning everyone and thanks for the opportunity for the questions. So, I'd like to come back to the wine divestiture to Gallo. It looks like, I mean, the $250 million earn-out is based on volume depletion performance in fiscal year 2020 and 2021 versus fiscal year 2019. And if I read it correctly in depletion orders between minus 10% from the payment to minus 2% for 100% payments, so could you please tell us, as we're kind of almost in the middle of it, the current volume depletion performance of the portfolio brands you\u2019re applying to divest to Gallo? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yes. Thanks for the question. And what I would tell you is that the earn-out portion of that transaction is really based on the 24 months after we closed the transaction. So we'll measure how those brands performing at the end of year one, and then again, the end of year two. Those brands have benefited recently by what Bill has described, as the change in consumer behavior to shift consumer behavior toward these tried and true brands or back to tried and true brands. And so some of the brands that we are divesting to Gallo is actually recovered quite nicely in that portfolio of brands is performing much better than it was a year ago at this time. So we feel is that as we transition that portfolio brands to Gallo, that they're in a very good position, and they're in a good state of health that we've got a very good chance of getting into that [indiscernible] a meaningful way. Operator : Our next question -- with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And you'll have to forgive me I'm still a bit confused. Did you say June beer's shipments are roughly minus 7% or are you saying June is down a bit more than minus 7% and July and August will help make up for to get the total quarter beer shipments to minus 7%? Bill Newlands : We didn't comment on shipments at all. We talked about depletions. As we\u2019ve said we have ramped up our production during June to normal levels, which will allow us as subsequent quarters. My personal suggestion would be that many of you think about the first quarter and the second the third, as in combination. Because as our production has ramped up, you will see some continuing stress on the shipment side of our business during Q2, and we would expect [depletes] to outperform ships during the quarter with a lot of that flipping as you go to the latter part of the year. Again, it still goes back to our long-range algorithm around beer being up 7% to 9% is very consistent. We expect that in the long run, and we view this short-term pandemic blip as being just that, a blip in our long-term success. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I would turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Great. Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining our call today. Despite the challenges and extremely volatile environment that were concurrent with the start of our fiscal year, we've delivered solid performance and strong cash flow generation during Q1, which provides us with great momentum, as we head into our key summer selling season. Let me reiterate that the short-term production disruption to our import beer business that we experienced during Q1 does not hinder our long-term outlook as consumer demand and takeaway for our brands remains extremely robust in the channels that remain open, and we remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. In closing, I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Fourth of July and hope that your celebrations with your family and friends includes our fantastic beers, our wines, and our spirit products. Thanks again everyone and please have a healthy and safe summer season. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter '21 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.  As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com.  Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before I begin with a discussion of our performance in the quarter, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the continued and unprecedented challenges of this year marked by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing social unrest rooted in a long history of racial injustice in this country, and the most recent string of natural disasters, including wildfires across the western part of the United States.  As it relates to the fires, fortunately, all Constellation employees are safe and accounted for, and there have been no direct impacts to any of our facilities. That said, our hearts go out to those who have been adversely affected by the fires, and we send our sincere thanks to the brave firefighters and other emergency personnel working tirelessly to battle the fires and keep people safe. I'd also like to thank the members of our Constellation team, who continued to pull together despite adverse circumstances to drive the success of our business, including excellent second quarter results. As Garth and I review these results, we'd like you to focus on 3 key takeaways. First, in what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID-related headwinds to deliver solid business performance in Q2. This performance was led by our beer business, which grew depletions by almost 5% as we continue to see incredible consumer demand for our portfolio of brands. While the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier in the year impacted shipments and net sales in Q2 and created some temporary out of stocks at retail, we are quickly recovering and expect inventory to return to normal levels by the end of Q3, and we're beginning to see accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to ensure that consumers can find their favorite Constellation products on the shelf at retail. Second, our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction as our higher-end wine power brands outpace the U.S. high-end wine category in IRI.  Regarding the Gallo transaction, both Constellation and Gallo remain committed to completing this transaction, and we're very encouraged by the progress that we've been making. We continue to receive positive feedback from the FTC staff and addressing the concerns that they raised related to the transaction. Based on our interactions with the FTC, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review and approval in the coming weeks. We're happy to say that this marks the final stage in this process. Once final approval is received, closing can happen quickly, which allows us to forge ahead with the strategy for our wine and spirits business.  And third, the strong performance delivered by our beer and wine and spirits businesses drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21. Let's move to a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down 50% in the quarter year-on-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth.  During the second quarter, our beer business delivered 11% growth in IRI channels overall and more than 15% growth for our priority SKUs. This performance was driven by 12% IRI growth for Modelo Especial as the brand solidified its position as the number three beer brand in the U.S. beer market, and the brand family is on track to deliver its 35th consecutive year of growth. The Corona Brand family also grew double digits in IRI channels, with the most significant contributions coming from Corona Hard Seltzer, Corona Premier and Corona Extra. We continue to be thrilled with the performance of Corona Hard Seltzer. Despite launching this new brand in the midst of a pandemic, which prevented us from engaging in a number of the activities conducive to introducing a new brand, Corona Hard Seltzer has become one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. With the launch of only one SKU to date, the brand continues to exceed our expectations and has already achieved the number four position in the category. To put this in perspective, Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer. Let me repeat that : Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer for those seltzer brands with significant distribution and velocity and remains strong as we continue to pick up distribution. These ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 70% since product launched in March. And to date, the brand has maintained incrementality levels at the 90% rate, significantly outpacing our expectations.  Corona Hard Seltzer over indexes to the Hispanic consumer relative to its competitors, which unlocks an untapped opportunity for this category with the fastest-growing demographic in the country. Currently, 15% to 20% of brand volume is estimated to come from Hispanic consumers, while other seltzer brands are closer to 10% to 15%.  Our expectations for the hard seltzer category growth are extremely high, and our intention is to become a top 3 player in the hard seltzer market as we believe there's a natural and compelling connection between what the Corona Brand stands for and what consumers want in a seltzer, refreshing great taste, hint of flavor and [ours] [ph] at 0 carbs, zero sugars and only 90 calories. In the future, you'll see us expand with new flavors, new packages and even new platforms. So stay tuned.  From an operational perspective, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our future plans for production in Mexico. Meanwhile, we're progressing with the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which is expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. As a reminder, after the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term. This includes more than doubling of our seltzer production capacity heading into our next fiscal year.  Let's now move to the quarterly results for our wine and spirits business. I'm pleased that we're nearing the finish line with the Gallo transaction, which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. It also aligns with the vision for our business to be a bold and innovative higher-end wine and spirits company with distinctive brands and products delivering exceptional consumer experiences.  During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of the consumer-led premiumization trend with premium price point segments continuing to outpace value price segments, further reinforcing the strategy of our business. In fact, our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high-end wine category in IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. These trends drove excellent margin performance for the business as price and mix benefits for this higher-end stable of brands drove significant margin enhancement. Throughout the remainder of the year, we plan to continue to invest in capabilities that position our wine and spirits business for long-term success.  The wine and spirits innovation pipeline is primed with impactful product introductions as we enter the peak seasonal period for the business. These initiatives are aligned with the key consumer macro trends of betterment, convenience and sustainability that we believe can drive scale going forward.  Key product launches include the Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals, SVEDKA and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, Ruffino wine spritzer and Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon. These initiatives will be supported throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. And while we're already a leading player in 3 tier e-commerce, we're excited about our renewed focus on the direct-to-consumer space with our acquisition of Empathy and our minority investment in the Booker Vineyard's business as we believe e-commerce, including DTC, can become a key growth driver for our business.  E-commerce for beverage alcohol has exploded due to the pandemic, increasing 3 to 4x in volume versus prior year. We were focused on e-commerce as a growing channel even before COVID and have further accelerated our strategy with increased resources and focus on digital shelf management and redeploying marketing dollars to support our digital commerce channels.  Now I'd like to take a minute to address the unfortunate wildfire situation in the west in a bit more detail. As mentioned, and thankfully, all of our employees are accounted for and safe, and no Constellation properties have been impacted by the fires. While we're more than 70% through harvest, it is still too early to determine the overall impact the fires and resulting smoke might have on this year's vintage. However, we continue to perform extensive testing and evaluation, and we have considered a number of potential contingencies and options as we progress through harvest based on our perspective at this point. That said, we are committed to providing consumers with the same high-quality wine they've come to expect from our higher-end brands. And despite potential impacts from the fires, we fully expect to be able to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products. Garth will provide some additional details in a few minutes on that topic. Now moving to our ventures portfolio. Last year, we announced our commitment to invest $100 million to support African-American black and minority-owned start-ups in the beverage alcohol space as part of our efforts to enhance diversity and access to opportunity within our industry. We're happy to say we've received significant interest in this program to date. We've also made good progress over the past several years with our focus on Female Founders initiative as female-funded and/or female-led businesses now account for more than half of our ventures portfolio. We see an opportunity to make similar progress in supporting African-American black and minority businesses in the coming years and look forward to updating you on our progress. We've recently acquired a minority stake in the Booker Vineyard's business, a super luxury direct-to-consumer focused wine portfolio to further align our wine and spirits business to changing consumer preferences. We believe this relationship strengthens our fine wine portfolio and our long-term aspiration to build a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce.  Additionally, we recently acquired the remaining interest in Copper & Kings American branding company, which marks our first full ventures acquisition. Copper & Kings is a cutting-edge distillery that primarily produces highly-differentiated American brandy with a tasting room and restaurant located in the heart of urban country in Louisville, Kentucky. This acquisition allows us to play in the rapidly emerging craft spirits market, where premiumization trends remain robust. Finally, we're pleased with the progress that the Canopy Growth team has made in prioritizing a strategic direction to focus on what's needed to become a world-class CPG company. They've identified goals for their core markets, rightsized their footprint, balanced supply and demand needs, improved execution and made progress in reducing operating expenses and cash burn.  I'm especially excited about the successful launch of the Rec 2.0 cannabis beverage products in the Canadian cannabis market, where Canopy has a 75% market share and the top 4 SKUs in the category, shipping more than 1.6 million cans since launch in March. For comparison, in the calendar year 2019, a total of 4 million cans of cannabis beverages were sold in the entire U.S. market over the course of that year. So great progress to date. We believe that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to the market and further drive conversion from the illicit market. And earlier today, Canopy growth announced plans to bring its line of cannabis beverages to the U.S. next summer through its revised agreement with Acreage Holdings. Overall, Canopy remains the best position to win long term in the emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face the challenges associated with this current economic environment. In closing, I want to take you back to the 3 key takeaways mentioned at the top. I'm extremely proud of the results our team has driven in the face of continued adversity. And what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID related headwinds to deliver solid business performance in Q2. Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, and we're seeing accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to rebuild our inventory position.  Our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction, and we are in the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo, which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. And our performance in the quarter drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.  This year also marks our company's 75th anniversary. We have a strong legacy of success that we're extremely proud of. Our continued growth and resilience will help ensure the future of our company remains extremely bright. And as I often like to say to our team, we firmly believe the very best is yet to come.  And with that, I would like to now turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the second quarter. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Despite an uncertain economic environment and headwinds related to COVID-19, Constellation Brands continues to generate strong financial results. During our second quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy growth, of $2.91, continued to deliver strong margins in both our beer and wine and spirits segments and increased free cash flow by 10%, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and progress in achieving targeted leverage. Now let's review Q2 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Despite reduced shipment volume in Q2 related to COVID-19, net sales were flat to prior year. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 1% on organic shipment volume down 1%, which was partially offset by favorable pricing.  Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in at nearly 5% driven by Modelo Especial and the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer as strong performance continued in the off-premise channel and more than offset the impact of the nearly 50% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19.  In Q2, we benefited from one extra sell day. When adjusted for the extra sell day impact, the beer business generated approximately 4% depletion volume growth. In Q3, depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. While depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 due to some out of stocks resulting from the slowdown in production earlier in the fiscal year, we remain confident in the strength of our business as underlying consumer demand remains quite robust. We are making good progress in rebuilding inventory supply across our network, both at our distribution centers and with distributors, following the production slowdown for roughly 2/3 of our Q1 and the beginning of Q2 that created out of stocks at retail and negatively impacted depletions during the quarter. We expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels by the end of Q3 as shipment volume is expected to outpace depletion volume during the quarter. Moving on to beer margins. Beer gross margin of 55.7% was flat to prior year as favorable pricing and the benefit of the Ballast Point divestiture was offset by unfavorable mix and increased operational costs driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at our breweries, resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption.  Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 8.4% as marketing spend decreased resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, beer operating margins increased 70 basis points to 42.5%.  Looking ahead to the balance of the year, a couple of items to touch on from a beer segment perspective. First, we plan on taking selective price increases this fall. For our pricing strategy, we implement price increases annually on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis depending on the dynamics within a given market. This year, our pricing approach remains intact. However, the timing of the price increases could be more staggered throughout the back half of the fiscal year and in some instances may shift into the beginning of our fiscal year 2020. With that said, for fiscal '21, we still expect 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. Second, our marketing spend in the first half of our fiscal year was significantly muted as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.6% due to the lack of sporting and sponsorship events. However, during the back half of the fiscal year, we are committed to an increase in spending behind our brands, especially by leveraging the return to sports. As such, we expect marketing spend in the range of 9% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis.  Moving to wine and spirits. Our wine and spirits power brand strategy continues to gain momentum as marketplace performance for our higher-end power brands continues to outpace the higher-end segment. However, as expected, power brand depletion volume decelerated during the quarter resulting in a 1% decline, while overall depletion volume for Q2 declined 3%, reflecting the brands to be divested.  To better align with our strategy for the business going forward, we did not replicate some lower return incentive programs and pricing initiatives that ran during our Q2 fiscal '20. During the quarter, we also worked to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While this drove a negative impact to depletion trends in the quarter, this will allow us to better manage inventories on a go-forward basis.  Wine and spirits net sales declined 11% on shipment volume, down 19%. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales declined 9%, reflecting shipment volume decline of approximately 17%, partially offset by robust price and mix benefits in the quarter. Q2 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands to be divested driven by the timing of the Gallo transaction.  Operating margin increased 310 basis points to 25.9% as benefits from price and mix, along with lower marketing spend, were partially offset by higher COGS and SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Higher COGS mostly reflect increased packaging costs, including glass and labels, partially offset by lower rate costs. In Q2, we experienced continued margin expansion driven by shipment volume mix resulting from some of our fast-moving power brands, such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner brand family, and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. In addition, we saw lower promotions as some incentive programming activities did not occur due to the current operating environment and COVID-19-related closures for the on-premise.  The marketing benefit to margin in the quarter is mostly related to timing as we plan to shift marketing dollars from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year to support key marketing and advertising initiatives for our power brands and innovation launches as we enter our peak selling season. Let me point out that a majority of the shift will occur in Q3, resulting in an increase in year-over-year spend for the quarter.  As Bill discussed, during August, significant wildfires broke out in California, Oregon and Washington state. We are currently monitoring and assessing the impact of the smoke damage from these wildfires as we progress through the August to October harvest season. At this time, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand. However, we expect our margins to be impacted as we recognize costs in the remainder of the fiscal year due to decreased production levels, driving unfavorable fixed cost absorption. Currently, we are estimating these costs of about $25 million to $35 million in Q3 and $10 million to $15 million in Q4 fiscal '21.  As Bill mentioned, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review and approval in the coming weeks and, therefore, expect the Gallo and other ancillary deals to close by the end of Q3. Therefore, we are expecting reported net sales for wine and spirits to be flattish to prior year in Q3 while expecting a decline of 20% to 25% in reported wine and spirits operating income, reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires and increased marketing expense during the quarter. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $110 million, up 13% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 10% to approximately $100 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio.  Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 16.9% versus 15.2% in Q2 last year primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. While our pre-COVID estimated full year FY '21 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, was 18%, we now expect the rate to approximate 19%. The 1 percentage point rate increase versus our pre-COVID estimate primarily reflects an estimated higher marginal rate on foreign earnings.  Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 10% increase. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx.  Fiscal year-to-date CapEx totaled $278 million or approximately 22% below last year's spend. This included approximately $200 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion project at our Obregon brewery, which we expect to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.  Moving to Canopy. In Q2, we recognized a $48 million decrease in the fair value of Canopy investments. These impacts were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $64 million. In August, Canopy reported first quarter fiscal '21 results. We are pleased with the progress that has been made since David Klein took over as CEO in rightsizing the business, reducing the company's cash burn and improving free cash flow. We are bullish on the growth prospects for Canopy growth as they continue to execute against their strategic plan. Now let's shift the discussion to outlook and guidance. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year and given the related uncertainty, volatility and fast-moving developments that have evolved during the first half of our fiscal year, we still do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal '21 at this time. However, let me reiterate that in a normalized environment, our medium-term growth algorithm remains unchanged for both our beer and wine and spirits segments.  In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. While we remain focused on our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23, in the short term given the volatile environment, we remain focused on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. In fact, we've reduced our net debt by nearly $600 million since the end of fiscal '20, resulting from our strong cash flow generation while continuing to maintain our quarterly dividend rate.  And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I wanted to ask a little bit about the spending that, Garth, you just kind of touched on. A key driver of your strong operating margins in the quarter really has been a result of lower marketing spend. And now you've talked about your outlook for spending for the full year being between 9% and 10% as a percentage of sales, which is about 50 bps lower than your previous guidance. So I kind of wanted to better understand that this is mainly a function of the ongoing pressures from COVID or do you see this maybe more as a realistic run rate going forward in terms of what you're seeing with your depletions and demand for your brands? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how you guys are balancing things and really how important it is for you to drive continued margin expansion. William Newlands : Sure, Bonnie. Let me take the first part of that, Garth. Our expected run rate is no different going forward than it's ever been. At the same point, because so much of our live events and sports were delayed in the year, I mean think about the NBA Finals, hockey, baseball playoffs, football, many of the things that we advertised on were pushed back later in the year, and therefore, into our third quarter. Some of our spend was also pushed back into those time frames as well. So our intention is to have a consistent run rate of spend in that 9% to 10% range as we always have, and you will expect to see a little bit more in the third quarter because many of those pre-bought scenarios will take place during that quarter rather than in the second quarter when we had originally anticipated they would occur. Garth Hankinson : Yes, and the only thing that I would add to that, Bonnie, is from a margin perspective, right, we continue to think that the right range to think about in terms of our beer margins are at 39% to 40%. Obviously, in any given year, we're going to face headwinds or tailwinds that are going to fluctuate a little bit. But those are best-in-class margins, and that's the right way to think about the business on a go-forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC. Sunil Modi : So Bill, I just wanted to have a chat on shelf space, right? So you guys have obviously been very active with the shopper first initiative, ran into a bit of a hiccup with supply/demand. So maybe you can just kind of give us a state of the union on are -- have you lost any spacing as a result of the out of stocks? Because that has happened in a few categories. So if you could just give us an update there.  And number two, how do you think the retail psychology is evolving as the last six months has gone on? Clearly, Constellation has been under space for a very long time. So I'm just curious like where the retail universe is right now in terms of your actual slot in the core. William Newlands : Sure. Certainly, the space issue has been somewhat challenging over the very most recent past, simply because of the reduction in production that we had around COVID-19. With that said, we have seen very little reduction of our overall space as we have spread out our product mix and our product offering into the existing space that we already had. We're also fortunate that many retailers have moved their resets and their timing back in the year for the same reason as because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which now matches up with the time when we're expecting to have our inventory levels back in a more normalized fashion during this quarter.  So we don't see any long-term issue around that. We've been very straightforward with our retail partners about where we are. And as you well state, our business, if anything, demands more space given the great acceleration that our brands have in the marketplace. And we expect that over time, we will continue to gain in the distribution area much as we have over the last several years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : As it relates to inventories, it looks like kind of year-to-date, you're running with shipments down about 4%, depletions up about 5%, and that's during a seasonal peak period. To get inventories back to where you want them by the end of Q3, what should we be thinking about in terms of the spread between shipments and depletions? Garth Hankinson : Yes. So Kaumil, thanks for the question. I'd say that the spread between depletions and shipments is going to be tough to gauge as we move through the quarter because it'll largely be dependent upon what depletions look like. And we've actually seen -- as Bill noted, we've actually seen very strong continued consumer takeaway in IRI, and depletion growth remains very robust. Suffice that to say, we do know that there will be a dislocation -- not really dislocation, but a difference in between shipments and depletions for the quarter. How much remains to be seen will be driven by consumer takeaway. William Newlands : Let me just add to that. I'm sure that you have seen in the most recent four week share data that our brands are accelerating as we bring more and more of them back to the table. I think as Garth points out, that's going to be a big factor in terms of what the balance is of that. Depletions are certainly accelerating, we're very pleased with that, but it's very tough to give you an exact answer without knowing how that will land during the course of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Vivien Azer : So I'm curious, Bill, it sounds like you're very constructive on the momentum that you've established early days on the Corona Hard Seltzer offering. Curious to hear how you're thinking about positioning a new hard seltzer offering and taking a portfolio approach to the category. William Newlands : Well, we've shipped about 5.5 million cases year-to-date, which is ahead of what we had expected, and we're very excited about it. As I already said, our velocity against literally one SKU is second in the category. So everything that's occurring around Corona Hard Seltzer has been sort of positive to what our initial expectations are.  As we already also stated, we're going to be in a position to put additional SKUs into the marketplace next year. We would -- we've already said also that our capacity would more than double next year. And keep in mind, we have a minority investment in PRESS, which we're very excited about. PRESS has performed exceedingly well. And as we've said in prior calls, we do expect some price stratification to occur over time in the seltzer category. So PRESS is very positive. We've also done some very limited regional things like Funky Buddha in Florida. In Florida, that particular brand is in the top 5 of all seltzers in the state of Florida. So we've got our toes in the water on a number of areas. Corona Hard Seltzer will continue to be our lead, but we certainly have other opportunities to continue to gain share in what is becoming a very important subsegment of the beer business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Garth, I just wanted to follow up on the incremental costs in the wine segment. So I guess two questions related to it. First are the costs that you highlighted, are they relevant to the -- or related to the ongoing business, so separate from the piece that's going off in the divestiture to Gallo? And then second, I guess trying to understand if this at all impacts kind of the timing or the cadence of supply chain for the wine business going into next year. And I guess what I'm trying -- I'm thinking of it is, are you -- is there a delay in terms of pressing grapes and putting juice in the tanks? Is there a delay in pulling product out of the tank and bottling? I'm just really just trying to understand if there's going to be any kind of disruption in the flow of the supply chain in wine that might lead into next year. Garth Hankinson : Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So the costs, as I outlined them, are for the remaining business, for the business that we are retaining, not for what we're divesting to Gallo. And as it relates to the question on supply chain, we don't expect there to be any material impact on our ability to meet consumer demand as we go forward. We have lots of flexibility in how we source grapes and fruit, whether that's through the bulk line market, the bulk line that we have on hand, our own vineyards, relationships we have with other growers. We don't see any impact on our ability to meet consumer takeaway. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So Bill, you mentioned your aspiration to be a top 3 player in the seltzer category -- hard seltzer category longer term. Obviously, you just touched on some of the new SKUs that you have planned. But can you also give us a sense for how important new platforms will be in that aspiration long term in terms of becoming a top 3 player? And is that more of a longer-term focus? Or could we see a big push behind new entries of brands in the hard seltzer more near term? William Newlands : Well, certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will be our primary approach to this category. As we stated, given our roughly $10 million capability for this year, we've relied on one -- literally one SKU. So as we go forward and we expand and finish the Obregon expansion that I discussed earlier, that gives us the opportunity to extend our reach within the Corona Hard Seltzer franchise.  We're a big believer that Corona is the perfect brand to maintain our lead focus for seltzer because it meets up exactly with the whole brand essence of refreshment, relaxation and finding your beach. So it -- that will continue to be the lead play for us, but we're always exploring what consumers are interested in going forward. And yes, we do have some additional things that we'll be talking to you about in future conference calls as to what we expect to do during the next fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Sean King : Yes, I wanted to dig a little bit more into what you're seeing in the month of September. I know you mentioned like based on the IRI data that we're seeing a gradual acceleration as you're getting more on the shelves, but in terms of the on-premise that you're seeing there would be helpful. And what I've been hearing is that there's fewer taps at most of the outlets that are open, if that's a potential headwind or a benefit for your portfolio. William Newlands : Sure. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise versus much of the competition with our brands. With that said, there's -- we had 50% closure in the second quarter. We had 75% in the first, and it's looking more and more like that will also reduce another 15% to 20% during the third quarter if things continue as they're going.  With that said, admittedly, the quarter -- I mean, excuse me, the month literally ended yesterday, so we're still adding it up. But it certainly looks like we're going to have a significantly better depletion month in September than we have year-to-date. In fact, it could quite well be our best month of the year so far. That matches up entirely with the acceleration that you've seen in IRI data over the last 4 weeks, which has been accelerating and returned us to a gaining share position, which is something we've normally seen in our business over the course of time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. This is building on Nik's question earlier. This is for you, Bill. Just the outlook for the Modelo brand looking out over the next few years and kind of pass some of the near-term volatility related to COVID comes up frequently with investors, understandably given the importance of the brands to your outlook. So could you comment on your ability to grow volumes in that business double digits over the next few years? As we look at the Nielsen channels, ACV is less of an opportunity. But as was pointed out, shelf space is an opportunity. So maybe comment on that a bit, talk a little bit about the interplay and your ability to drive that kind of growth, the interplay between Modelo with the Corona brand. And then just lastly, perhaps touch on, is it in the consideration sector that you would extend the Modelo brand into seltzers as well? William Newlands : Sure. As we've said, Modelo is one of the chief growth drivers of our beer business. Modelo Especial has become the number three beer brand in the U.S. market, and it continues to accelerate, part of -- it does that for a number of reasons. One is it continues to have a disproportionate SKU in the Hispanic community, which is a growing demographic in the United States, but we've also radically extended that into the non-Hispanic community. Jim Sabia has been advertising to the non-Hispanic community only for the last few years. So this is relatively new that we've been expanding the reach, particularly in Modelo Especial.  As you know, our Chelada introductions have gone extremely well, one after the next. And certainly, it's continued to see growth in Negra as well. So the overall family is very healthy. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at the 35th consecutive year of growth for that brand. And quite honestly, I don't know how high is up. I think there's -- there remains tremendous opportunity to extend that franchise, both with its core Hispanic community as well as the non-Hispanic marketplace into which we've started to advertise.  I highly doubt that we will do a seltzer under that brand. We believe that the core essence of that brand focuses much more on full flavored beer. And any innovation that we might approach on that particular brand will follow more of the brand essence of the Modelo brand rather than what we have done with Corona, where we feel the whole refreshment platform matches up perfectly with the hard seltzer subsegment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back to the depletions commentary. I understand there are obviously a lot of puts and takes, but you sounded optimistic. So Bill, are you running in the mid-single digits as you alluded to before or even at the high single digits for beer depletions in September? William Newlands : Well, as I said earlier, and I'll maintain that thought given we have not even gotten all the numbers in yet, and therefore, Garth has not added them all up. But it appears that September will be significantly better than what our year-to-date has been. And as I said, it very likely will be our single best month of the year.  So we continue to be optimistic that what we've seen on takeout and IRI trends that have occurred over the last four weeks is currently being reflected in our increased depletion trend that we're seeing in September, which again matches up with our expectation given we have been back operating at normal levels within the plant now for a significant period of time. So again, it's a little difficult to put an exact number on it right at this point, but it certainly looks like September was a very, very positive month. Andrea Teixeira : And if I can squeeze -- that's helpful, Bill. If I can squeeze just a margin question. I know it's like you just quoted some of the expenses that are -- I mean, obviously, the COVID expenses. Other than those, like which may or may not recur as we lap next year, are we looking at obviously a better outlook now that production is when -- it's where it should be and you're reaching back to the production and you're getting obviously economies of scale and you're getting your seltzer volumes like as you quoted better than anticipated? Should we see a progression in like long-term outlook for margins to continue to build or you're going to have to invest more into the pricing? The pricing commentary obviously is going to last, but you're going to increase the pricing through the beginning of fiscal -- we could go into fiscal, but I'm just thinking of the puts and takes of FX and volumes coming back, how we should be thinking about margins going forward. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So margins for our beer business going forward, as we said earlier, the right range to think about them is, as we said previously, which is that 39% to 40% range, right, again, best-in-class margins. In any given year, we're going to have puts and takes as it relates to margins. We're going to get the benefits of our pricing, but we're also going to face headwinds around things like incremental depreciation that flows through cost of goods as well as we build and add capacity, we'll have periods where we have lower utilization rates, which can -- which will have a drag. And so as we say, there's always going to be these puts and takes in any given year, but 39% to 40% is the right way to think about our margin profile over the medium term.  And on the seltzer point that you raised, seltzer currently is a drag given the additional flavors and some of the co-packing that needs to be done there. As we progress and as we get to be -- have more scale in seltzer, there'll definitely be margin improvement there, and we'll start to get closer in line with Corona Extra glass. But again, even as margins improve on seltzer, that there will be other puts and takes. So 39% to 40% is the right way to think about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Bill, I just want to kind of step back and ask you a big picture question that you're probably in a better position to answer than anybody else. And that is at least based on the data we get, and for spirits, it's not that good, but even with the tremendous boost that the beer industry has gotten from hard seltzers, it looks like spirits are gaining share of throat and that maybe even have accelerated this year. And based on what you see, is that, in fact, true? And what do you account for that? Is it the out of stocks for beer? Or is there something -- due to the COVID environment that favors spirits? And if these trends look like they're going to continue, are you thinking just in terms of your long-term capital allocation to pivot more towards spirits? I know you just made a spirits acquisition. But just how are you thinking about that dynamic? William Newlands : Sure, Rob. It's very difficult in a COVID year to make lots of predictions about what will be sustainable and what will maintain itself once we come out of the COVID scenario and what won't. I do think it's very fair to say there will be some fundamental change. Some of that fundamental change will be about 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, things that we're investing a lot of our energy and focus on going forward. So I wouldn't make a lot of prediction as to what the adjustments that could occur between spirits or beer or wine. What I would say is we have worked aggressively, as you've seen, to make sure that our portfolio is positioned for where the consumer is going, not where the consumer has been. We've invested in craft spirits, which we think has tremendous upside. Our beer business plays in the high end, which is where the growth in the category is. We're extending our capabilities in seltzer to more than double what we have done in this fiscal year going forward. And our wine business is tremendously positioned to continue to leverage the premiumization trend that's going on. In addition to that, we're doing the kinds of innovations that the consumer is looking for in things like betterment and convenience. You're seeing that in some of the new products that we've talked about this year.  That's where our focus really lies, and I think there's tremendous opportunity within our portfolio no matter how it shakes out post-COVID. As I said, I do think there will be some fundamental change about how the consumer buys. And to some degree, there almost has to be because there has been a significant shift from the on-premise to the off-premise. And I think that the long-term trend of that, I still think, is too early to predict. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Grant O'Brien: This is Grant on for Bill. Just had one on the wine and spirits power brand's depletion growth this quarter. I was just hoping, Garth, you give a bridge on some of those impacts you walked through the inventory changes at the distributor level and the promotional changes. Just trying to get an underlying growth number for that business. Garth Hankinson : Yes. I think the question is that you want to understand sort of like why the power brand growth wasn't higher than you were expecting, and that really is because we did do -- we didn't repeat some non-return generating promotional activity or take some non-enhancing -- non-value-enhancing pricing actions. And we also cleaned up or reduced the number of days outstanding with some key retailers. So the underlying brands are strong as you see in the IRI takeaway, and the reduction or a slowdown in depletions really is just -- is doing a little bit of house cleaning, so to speak. William Newlands : Yes. Keep in mind, Bill, if I could add -- just to add to Garth's comment, our high-end over $11 power brands continue to outpace their competition, and that's led by Meiomi and the Prisoner family, Kim Crawford. These brands are accelerating in the minds of consumer.  Keep in mind, going back to sort of Robert's question from a minute ago, one of the things that we continue to see is people are attracted to try and true brands. And we are very fortunate when you talk about our beer business or our wine business or our spirit business to have a lot of those brands that are inherently trusted, and that has been extremely helpful for us during the pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Laurent Grandet : Another question on seltzer. With the launch of Topo Chico seltzer next year, there will be more competition to attract Hispanic consumers into the seltzer category potentially from beer. So first, I mean do you see Topo Chico seltzer as a risk for your core Mexican beer business? And second, what are your plan with Corona seltzer to increase Hispanic penetration that seems to be low by your account? William Newlands : Well, as I said earlier, we have been very pleased by the development of our Corona Hard Seltzer business with the Hispanic community. It's indexing somewhere between 5 and 10 points greater than the overall category, and we think that speaks very well to broadening the reach of the seltzer subsegment with consumers. So we're very positive about that.  As I'm sure you've seen, there's been a lot of introductions in the seltzer category, but consumers have a tendency to go with tried and true, trusted brands. And there is really no stronger brand that's trusted in the minds of consumers than Corona. And certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will fall into that ZIP code as well. So we always wish well for our competition, but we'll be quite happy to do our bit, and we'll see how it all falls out. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bill Newlands for any further remarks. William Newlands : Thanks, Jonathan. So thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Despite the continued and unprecedented challenges that have occurred since the beginning of our fiscal year, our team continues to remain agile and have overcome massive headwinds to deliver strong business performance in the first half of our fiscal year. We remain confident in the resiliency of our business.  Our beer business, as we've discussed today, continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, while our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum, especially as we enter the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo. We remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, and we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.  Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. So I'm wishing everyone at this point a safe and happy holiday season, and I'm also reminding you to enjoy some of our great products during your socially-distant celebrations with your family and friends. So thanks again for joining the call today, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's third quarter 2021 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and happy new year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took. Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation\u2019s capital yesterday. I join other leaders across the country in condemning the violence that occurred, instead calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation. Now, let\u2019s move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year, and like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, are mindful of the words of American novelist, James Lane Allen who said, \u201cAdversity does not build character, it reveals it.\u201d This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably a significant volume reduction in the on-premise, a slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season, and threats to the safety, health and wellbeing of our team members. Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company\u2019s history. We continue to transform our Wine and Spirits business, leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance, while investing in capabilities needed to win long-term, such as DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce and successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which now that it is complete positions our Wine and Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile. And we have also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities, by once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community and by improving our Carbon Disclosure Project ratings for climate and water stewardship. While 2020 will be remembered for many things, what I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID, while maintaining full employment resource levels. I continue to be impressed by the \u2013 inspired by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results. As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are three things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations and we are back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower-end wine brands priced at $11 and below in retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability, driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we are on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. I\u2019m proud to say that our business remains healthy, allowing us to provide fiscal 2021 guidance that I am sure you will agree reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let\u2019s dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year, Constellation\u2019s beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future, as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. In fact, Constellation\u2019s beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter. As you know, the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year\u2019s shipment and volume net sales trends. The good news is that we\u2019ve returned to a position of gaining share in IRI-tracked channels, as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end, a process that\u2019s actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands. So let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona Brand Family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels, led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra. With the launch of only one SKU to date, Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong number-four position in the Hard Seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving Hard Seltzer among major seltzer brands, while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%. Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which will offer consumers the same great Corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety Pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new hard seltzer initiative. We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our hard seltzer portfolio. 2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona\u2019s iconic O\u2019 Tannenpalm commercial that was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, O\u2019 Tannenpalm demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world. Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the number one spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category, with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers, while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer, driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, Spanish language soccer, as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram. Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand, as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio. From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal 2022, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic-related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium-term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year. Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth for fiscal 2021. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. Now let\u2019s move on to the quarterly results for our Wine and Spirits business. As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions which positions our Wine and Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our Constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition. With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine and Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low-to-mid single digits, while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium-term. In the near-term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal 2021 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands that better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment, further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business. Our higher-end wine Power Brands, at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high-end wine category IRI channels, driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long-term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to topline growth with Power Brand introductions like The Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, which has become this year\u2019s biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales. In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like Unshackled from The Prisoner Wine portfolio, Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge Spirits Barrel Aged varietals just to name a few. And let\u2019s not forget, Woodbridge wine go-packs, which became the number two innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales. We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy Wines, we have continued to make significant progress in leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites, leveraging the Empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and Simi. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for Constellation in the future. In fact, our Wine Power Brands competing in the e-commerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads, propelling Constellation to the next level of 3 Tier e-commerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space, since DTC is heavily weighted towards the higher end of the wine category as wines priced $20 up, make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales. Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We are pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets, which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that\u2019s occurred in the last 48 hours. Canopy\u2019s core BioSteel beverages are now the official sports drink of the Dallas Mavericks, The Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors and has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realize the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, BioSteel now has two exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Reyes Beer Division, two key Constellation distributors, which will give Canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space. In September, Canopy launched Martha Stewart branded CBD product line, which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with The Vitamin Shoppe retail locations, just in time for the holidays. Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness of these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long-term in the emerging cannabis space. In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I am extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we are on track to deliver another strong year of growth consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business, enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal 2023. Our business remains extremely healthy and these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth of $3.16, an increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23% respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of target net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the quarter at 3.3x. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine and Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo wine brand, as well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to Vie-Del. As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio which nicely positions our Wine and Spirits business to produce low-to-mid single-digit topline growth, while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium-term. In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earnouts if brand performance targets are met over a three-year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal. In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2022. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction, so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023. The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to wildfires. As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it is a replacement for smoke-tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those two factors resulted in substantial cash flow for Constellation throughout the fiscal year. Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment, we have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.80 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity in earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures. Now let\u2019s review Q3 performance and our full-year outlook in more detail, where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% and shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% in favorable price and mix. Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately three to four points driven by inventory restocking. While underlying consumer demand for our products remained strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level. As product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID-related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year, this resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the Ballast Point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational cost was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics costs resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full-year fiscal 2021 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range. Now let\u2019s discuss balance of your expectations and full-year fiscal 2021 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes one to two points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact to Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal 2021 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. Furthermore, we expect full-year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%. Looking at Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective, as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases, and in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal 2022. As a result, we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3, which will continue in Q4. Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we are taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal 2022. Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media, and continue to support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra O\u2019 Tannenpalm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal 2022 and the spring selling season. Moving to Wine and Spirits. Q3 Power Brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher-end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflected the brands recently divested. Wine and Spirits net sales increased 10%, and shipment volume up 3% driven by our Power Brands, as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested, driven by the timing of the Gallo deal. Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing, driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires. During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes from our own vineyards and we are actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory maybe needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products. Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continue to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving Power Brand such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner Brand Family and we are continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year. Moving along to balance of the year expectations and full-year fiscal 2021 Wine and Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal 2021 Wine and Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11% and 16% to 18% respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction, as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year. Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine and Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect Power Brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following. First, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal 2020 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal 2020 innovation driven by the rollout of Unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to right-size inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward. Also let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect a shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our Power Brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal 2022. This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4. Now let\u2019s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. We now expect full-year corporate expense to approximate $240 million. This is a good spot to provide an update on our SAP S/4HANA implementation. I am excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal 2022, once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented and we begin to eliminate redundant IT cost, allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continued to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal 2021 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full-year fiscal 2021 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings impact to approximate 19%, which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2021. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full-year fiscal 2021 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. Furthermore, we expect fiscal 2021 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investments. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2 driven by Canopy\u2019s robust share price movement during the quarter. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we\u2019ve navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first nine months of our fiscal year, we believe it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we\u2019ve reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal 2020, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment, now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near-term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023. We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So beer depletion growth was obviously strong in the quarter even ex the retailer inventory rebuild on an underlying basis also. Just looking going forward to beer depletions, can you discuss your level of comfort that once we cycle COVID in March, you're back to sustained high single-digit beer revenue growth going forward, in line with the long-term goals, do you expect to return to historical levels of share gains? Also, basically just wanted to get an update on your visibility there on beer depletions and market share, particularly given the comments on high single-digit beer revenue growth in the foreseeable future. And then also, maybe can you just touch on if there is any risk specifically in fiscal Q4, with the rising COVID case counts and weaker on-premise trends before we cycle the COVID impact from last year in March? Thanks. William Newlands : You bet. So let me try to unpack that a bit. Yes, one of the benefits that we've seen as our business has been moving through the year is that we are getting back to our long-term trends that we have previously announced. And that's driven quite frankly by the strength of our brands. Modelo in this quarter was nearly 20% depletion growth, Pacifico was the same. These brands are resonating with consumers. And keep in mind that's all being done \u2013 which relates to your second question, with on-premise trends that are really not very good. Year-to-date, on-premise for our beer business is off 53%. So I think the fact that we have produced these kinds of results with that environment speaks to the strength of our beer portfolio and the long-term positioning that we have for those brands. You then throw in the fact that we are more than doubling our capability in seltzer next year, and I think we should expect to see \u2013 consistent with our long-term trends, the growth profile we previously stated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. Thank you. Hi guys and happy new year. William Newlands : Hi, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : I have a question on your full-year beer operating income growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Although you revised it higher, it actually still implies a pretty big hit to your beer margins in Q4. So I just really wanted to better understand why this is the case, especially as I look at the easy year-over-year margin comp and even factoring in the year-over-year increase you just called out in terms of marketing spend. So I guess I'm really wondering if you're simply being ultra conservative on the upside in operating income growth for beer or is there something else? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yes. Thanks Bonnie. Yes, so we did increase the range a little bit there as you said 8% to 10%, and we did increase our margin outlook closer to 41%. So we feel really good about that margin profile by the way. But you're right, that does imply some bit of dilution if you will in Q4, so let me just give you some of the elements that make up that. As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS-related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics, as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. And we also in Q4 have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year and we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your question, please. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Good morning, everyone and happy new year. William Newlands : Thanks, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So couple of questions. First one just on \u2013 question related to Seltzer. And I guess question is really just, as you look at it going forward and again thinking about an aspiration to be a top three player, can you just give us your thinking now in terms of how we should think about, is that going to include launching new brands and also just thinking about Topo Chico and co-working with Molson Coors, would you be open to maybe partnering with some other companies brands in order to sort of put more lines in the water I guess in seltzers? William Newlands : Sure. Obviously, the seltzer category continues to remain strong. As we've said, we plan to more than double our capability in the seltzer area for Corona Hard Seltzer in the coming year. I mean the fact that we've done as well as we have with one SKU, this year one variety pack, we think is pretty impressive and certainly ahead of what our expectations were. But keep in mind we also have our toe in the water on some other things. Funky Buddha in Florida has performed extraordinarily well in the seltzer category, in that particular market, and we are extending that some in the coming year. We have a minority investment in PRESS, which has done \u2013 also done extremely well in the seltzer category. So we have our toes in the water in a number of ways. Certainly, our Corona Hard Seltzer is going to be our lead play and we think that is where the majority of our growth in that category will come from. As we said, we have a second variety pack that we're introducing at the beginning of the fiscal year, and then we have a couple of other things we might be doing which you'll hear more about as we go forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. Sunil Modi : Yes. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon, and happy New Year. Just two questions from me. Bill, there's been some, obviously, controversy around Corona Seltzer given what some of the data has said in terms of deteriorating share trend. So I was hoping you could just provide some context around what everyone has seen versus what you guys are seeing in terms of that brand from a supply-demand and balance perspective? And then just as the brand continues to grow, are you going to have enough capacity to effectively execute the hard seltzer lemonade launch later in the year? And then my kind of secondary question is on Corona Light. Obviously, the brand has struggled relative to the other Corona franchises, and just curious what the plan is there over the next one to two years? William Newlands : Sure. As it relates to Corona Hard Seltzer, we are more than doubling our capacity in that particular franchise for the coming year. And as you know and you commented, we're extending that into additional pack opportunities. We've sold everything we could make this year and we were very pleased with the performance. And frankly, that was \u2013 as I said earlier, that was a bit better than we expected to do. So we're quite pleased with where we stand in the overall seltzer market, and certainly with the more than doubling of capacity next year, we expect to remain a very strong player and a top three player in that particular segment. Keeping in mind, Nik, we have the second-best velocity in the category with that particular brand with one SKU. So I think as we're able to broaden our distribution reach on the shelf, I think we'll be very pleased with where seltzer is when we're sitting here a year from now. As it relates to Light, obviously a lot of our work and a lot of our time and energy has been spent on Premier, which we're very excited about, continues to be a big growth profile for us. So I think we need to think about that, particularly the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall Light category and our Premier, Corona Light et cetera. And I think, obviously, Light has been hurt some. However, the trends actually been quite good during this COVID timeframe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your question, please. Vivien Azer : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, it seems pretty clear you guys have a lot of your sleeve on the hard seltzer front with clear market share gain aspiration. But I was wondering whether you could comment at all on the deceleration that we've seen in the hard seltzer in scanner data over the last six or seven months? And how that informs what you think is kind of a better normalized growth rate for the category going from here? Thanks. William Newlands : Yes. I think the one thing that we've probably seen a bit of is some seasonality this year. And it's not unusual, I don't think. As you get more and more people into the category, you get more consumers who are either less frequent users or experimenting in the category. And oftentimes, there is some movement around within categories when that occurs. You couple that when there is a bit more seasonality that we've seen this year than what we have seen in prior years. So I still think it remains a very strong growth category. It grew, if you remember on our call last year, we anticipated, or I made the comment that I thought it would at least double in 2020 calendar year. In fact, it did more than that as a category and we still see strong trends. So we think this is going to continue to be a growth category, although it's obviously, like any other category, it's difficult to continue to grow at the pace it has been growing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey. Good afternoon. A question, maybe housekeeping on this new share buyback. It's $2 billion on top of the remaining $1.9 billion. Is this on the same timeline as your original $4.5 billion kind of cash return to shareholders, or is the additional $2 billion stretched out over some more extended period given there's been a little bit of time? And then secondarily, could you maybe comment a bit on your distribution trends during the period in which you were supply constrained versus now that supply is starting to come back, if there was an ebb and flow there in any particular direction in terms of what we're seeing? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So I'll answer the first question there. So in terms of \u2013 you're right that the one point or that the $2 billion we just announced is in addition to the $1.9 billion. The additional $2 billion is to give us further flexibility around share repurchases and we're still committed to the $5 billion return to shareholders, half of which is share repurchases through the end of fiscal 2023. William Newlands : And relative to distribution trends, we were actually quite pleased with our ability to hold shelf presence. As you know and we said in prior calls, we focused our attention on the 20-ish SKUs that represented more than 75% of our total portfolio during the time when we had a slowdown in production. So that allowed us to expand and extend some of those SKUs on shelf and allowed us to maintain our position. Obviously, now that we have been able to raise our production rates and we are filling in some of those scenarios that had occurred, we're quite pleased that we're maintaining and in fact growing our distribution platform going forward. Keeping in mind, in many instances, retailers did not do shelf reset during the COVID timeframe just because of the pandemic. So we're very comfortable with our distribution platform. We think that given some of the things we have coming down the path, we'll be able to extend that going forward as we have every other year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your question, please. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thank you. And I just want to talk a little bit about wine. It was really nice improvement in the Power Brands depletion versus the first half of the year. So was curious if you could talk a little bit about what drove that? Maybe there were some pull forward given the net sales outlook kind two to four. So curious what those dynamics. And then also, just the pricing and promotional environment in wine, the space where Kim and Meiomi play is certainly premium priced, but it feels like there's been kind of a bit more discounting activity out there. And so just kind of curious in your perspective on pricing at that price point where you play. Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. Lauren, we're seeing two or three things in the wine space. First of all, given there has been some change in how the consumer purchases, more DTC, more 3 Tier e-commerce. Consumers are going with brands that are tried and true and we're fortunate to have some that are extremely well received. You noted a couple of \u2013 Meiomi has done extremely well, Kim, The Prisoner Wine Company. These are brands that are trusted by consumers, loved by consumers. And that certainly helped the process, particularly as peoples shopping patterns changed some. Secondly, our innovation agenda has worked extremely well. Things that we did earlier in the year, like Unshackled has done very well, as well as some of the newer things that we've done. We noted in my brief prepared remarks that Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the strongest individual entries that occurred in the entire industry this past year, and you add into that The Prisoner Cabernet and The Prisoner Chardonnay. We did very well with our innovation agenda as well. And I don't think we have seen \u2013 I would slightly disagree with your comment that there has been a more aggressive environment or aggressive promotional environment. Fortunately, the robust demand that we've seen in many of our Power Brands above $11 where we had lots of double-digit growers, our demand has been very strong and that has been the single biggest driver of our improved wine results is the sheer demand for our products and the fact that the consumer is looking for brands and products that they have great faith in, especially as their shopping patterns have changed some. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your question, please. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I just want to drill down a little bit more into the accelerating depletion trends that you saw in the quarter, which were quite marketed. I mean, do you think this is just purely a function of the greater availability of your brands on the shelf or increase in media spend against them, the timing of your price increases and improving consumer? Just trying to get a little feel for those different drivers. And then tied into that, how do you see the distribution gains looking in terms of calendar 2021? Thank you. William Newlands : Sure. I mean, there were a number of factors that weighed in on the improved performance. It starts and always will start with the strength of the brands. And certainly, as we were able to get our inventory position into a much better place during the quarter, it was reflected in our results and then it is reflected in the demand consumers had. Remember, we had roughly 15% growth across the beer portfolio and in IRI during the quarter, extremely robust growth, especially given the fact that on-premise was a drag to say the least. Fortunately again, we are a little less susceptible to the on-premise and some of the overall marketplace. But the sheer strength of our brands was a critical factor. No question, some of the depletion pieces Garth noted in his remarks were driven by our replacing some of the inventory that had decreased during the time when we were not able to produce. But I think we do need to keep in mind, the end of the day, it's all about consumer takeout, and consumers are strongly demanding our critical brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your question, please. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy new year and congratulations on the strong results. William Newlands : Thank you. Kevin Grundy : Bill, question relates to the competitive outlook. Building on Lauren's question from wine, but I'm going to kind of ask you from a beer and seltzer angle for the upcoming year. So the context for the question, given the obvious challenges from the pandemic this past year on-premise, out of stock this past summer, et cetera, many in the industry, including you guys, were really unable to support your brand sufficiently with marketing budget cut rather sharply. So my question is, what is your outlook? How are you guys thinking about the next 12 months in terms of the competitive backdrop, specifically around pricing and brand support as the industry returns to health? Do you foresee a more competitive backdrop than we've seen in the past as companies try to reinvigorate the top line, or do you expect a generally rational environment? Thanks. William Newlands : I think it's tough to tell what others will do. What I'll tell you is what we plan to do, is we plan to continue to spend in that 9% to 10% range of our marketing spend in our beer business, and we've got a lot of good things to talk about. We're extending our investment against Modelo. We'll be reintroducing Refresco this year. Despite the tremendous performance, we have things like Refresco that we just stopped producing, and we're going to reintroduce even though it had a tremendous start before the pandemic hit. So we expect it to certainly be a competitive marketplace, but demand remain strong, and that's certainly to our advantage because our brands have performed very well in that mix. As we've said, we are going to continue to invest behind our brand. Our brands respond extremely well. Jim Sabia does an outstanding job with his team about making sure that we get tremendous returns against the dollars that we spend against our brands. And we expect that that sort of intelligent approach to investment behind our business will continue, and then when you add on the fact that we will be adding additional products into the mix that we will invest behind, I think we're going to have a very robust and aggressive year in building our brands for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Your question, please. You may have your phone on mute. William Newlands : The COVID new issue. Operator : Still not hearing you. Should I move on to the next questioner? William Newlands : Yes, please. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Your question, please. Sean King : Hi, great. Thank you. First off \u2013 and apologies if I missed this, but is there any color you can provide on the quarter-to-date completions, now that we're five weeks in, are you still reloading shelves? And then secondly, sort of looking longer-term at the on-premise. Your historic exposure, I guess, under indexed of the industry in like a pre-COVID world. As we think about the reopening, will that continue to be a case based on the way you're brands are positioned around occasions or could there be incremental shelves or incremental share gains in that channel as that trade focuses on higher velocity brands? Garth Hankinson : So as it relates to our current depletions through the first month of the quarter, depletions continue to perform in line with where they are so far through the fiscal year-to-date and the expectation is that they'll continue like that through the remainder of our quarter. And then on the \u2013 I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question? William Newlands : Which channel \u2013 we missed it. Which channel are you referring to? I'm sorry. Sean King : Sorry, I was just referring to the on-premise, that you historically under indexed the industry, and if there is an opportunity going forward that that mix could actually have incremental share gains with the portfolio? William Newlands : Well, certainly, historically, as you said, we have under indexed in that. And we're seeing wide variability depending on what month, what state, what market, what city as to what's going on in the on-premise. That's been, frankly, the most difficult thing for any of us in the industry to project as to where it's going to go and how it's going to go there. What I would say is, we have very focused business plans against each channel. We plan by channel, as you would expect, and by customer; and we would certainly expect to have a strong showing in the on-premise once we get back to something resembling normalcy, acknowledging that the general consensus within the industry is that we are going to have a smaller on-premise coming out of the pandemic than we had going in, just because of the challenges that unfortunately many of our important accounts have had during the pandemic. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Christopher Carey : Hi, good afternoon. So I guess \u2013 I just wanted to talk about capital allocation, just to end things, but from a bit different perspective maybe than how it's been addressed so far. So I guess in July, Constellation had noted that after exercising that last batch of Canopy warrants that it was going to see how things unfolded in the U.S. and Canada. I mean, I'd argue that Tuesday's Senate results made the U.S. a much more tangible opportunity for cannabis much sooner. And I wouldn't expect maybe Canopy's spending to be as inefficient as it was in Canada, but certainly U.S. expansion requires money. And I just \u2013 I wonder if your thought process on these warrants has changed at all in the medium-term, because I think it'd certainly pick up a bit sooner, and how that factors into this renewed commitment to buybacks and just any perspective there? And I guess just on top of that \u2013 apologies for the long question at the end of the call \u2013 but that can also impact Canopy's profitability, is that an acceptable outcome? And so just any color there? Thanks so much. Garth Hankinson : Sure. So just on capital allocation in general, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we said earlier this year, which is continuing to pay down debt and getting into and maintaining levels inside our targeted leverage ratio that we're comfortable with. And we've made good progress on that this year. So far, we've brought our leverage ratio down about 59 basis points from where we started the year, about 39 basis points since the end of Q2, and we announced earlier this week that the early redemption of another $500 million in notes. So we're going to \u2013 that continues to be priority number one. And then, we are fully committed to the share repurchase program that we've previously announced, which is to return to shareholders $2.5 billion worth of capital through share repurchases by the end of our fiscal 2023, as well as dividends to make up the balance. As it relates specifically to the Canopy warrants, there is still \u2013 on the next batch of warrants, there's still two years left on those. So we don't need to make a decision anytime soon. Even with the performance of Canopy's share price, they're still not in the money. So we'll make the decision on those warrants much more closely to when they mature or to their termination date. William Newlands : I would also just add to that, what Garth said, that keep in mind, Canopy has already had \u2013 is already well prepared for the U.S. market relative to their investments or their prepared investments in both acreage and terrace land, plus their cash position. So we would certainly expect that if there is any speed up in the federal legalization, that Canopy is well positioned to be a winner in the U.S. market going forward. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Bill Newlands for any further remarks. William Newlands : Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining our call today. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're again on-track to deliver a strong year of growth, which is consistent with our long-term goals. We're confident in the resiliency of our business. Our beer business remained strong as demand continues to be robust, while our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum and is further enhanced by the completion of the Gallo deal. The health of our business has allowed us to provide fiscal 2021 guidance that reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This, coupled with the closure of the Gallo transaction, allows us to continue to execute on our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal 2023. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Thanks again, everyone, for joining the call and I wish you all a safe, happy and prosperous New Year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Joanna. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year-end fiscal '21 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our year-end call. It's now been a little more than a year since the onset of the pandemic and for many it's been one of the most challenging years in recent memory. At this time last year, we outlined our philosophy for managing the business and navigating through this period of uncertainty. We committed to making decisions that prioritize the physical and economic safety, health and well-being of our employees. We committed to remaining consumer obsessed, relentlessly focused on doing all we can to meet consumer needs. We pledged to continue managing our business with discipline ensuring appropriate balance between short-term needs and positioning Constellation for sustainable long-term success and we pledged to continue making decisions aligned with our long-term strategic vision. This is what best of class companies do in periods of uncertainty and I'm extremely proud to say that is exactly what our team delivered over the course of the physical year and then some. Working together with our distributor and retail partners, we overcame numerous headwinds posed by the pandemic to achieve strong earnings growth and record free cash flow, while significantly reducing debt. This strong performance was led by our beer business, which delivered double-digit operating income and organic net sales growth for the fiscal year. Looking forward, we not only have an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year, but we expect our core portfolio to generate robust growth well into the foreseeable future, and therefore have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion in Mexico. Our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during the fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower end wine brands positioned this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward. In addition to the strong performance of our business units, our company also stepped up to help industry partners and communities impacted by COVID and natural disasters and to lend our voice and support in combating social injustice in the U.S. This commitment continues through our additional 1.75 million contribution to the National Restaurants Associations Education Foundation, announced earlier this week to support on premise recovery efforts, as well as our recent 10 million contribution to the Clear Vision Fund, designed to invest in minority-owned businesses, primarily those operating in underserved black and Latinx communities and through our most recent efforts to address the disturbing trend of violence against people of Asian descent across the country. In this regard, let me once again extend our deepest sympathies to victims of these deplorable acts and our continued support of members of the Asian community in this difficult time. Our strong business performance coupled with learnings from the past year and planned investments to enable growth, along with our continued commitment to making a positive impact on the world around us positions Constellation for continued success in fiscal '22 and beyond. Now, let's move to a more detailed discussion of our results and our plans for this year. Fiscal '21 marked the 11th consecutive year of growth for our beer business and reinforced our leadership position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. We drove exceptional performance across our beer portfolio, led by our Casa Modelo brand family, including Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada, which remains one of the biggest forces in the U.S. beer industry, delivering more than 13 million cases of growth to the beer category last year. Modelo Especial achieved yet another year of double-digit growth and now stands as the number three selling beer in the U.S. in dollar sales with more than 145 million cases sold last year, the only imported beer to ever surpass 10 million barrels in volume. Modelo Negra continues to be the number one dark beer in the U.S. category. While Modelo Chelada once again achieved double-digit growth and remains the number one Chelada brand in IRI channels. The Modelo brand family is on [fuego] [ph] but we're far from done. We have a tremendous amount of momentum with Casa Modelo and we continue to have huge growth opportunities in front of us. Our core Hispanic drinker remains the foundation of our business representing more than half of our volume, yet we're still growing volume, penetration and by rate with them. We're also making great progress with the non Hispanic consumer, where we've grown penetration by 25% over the last two years. And while we continue to grow simple distribution, our effective distribution levels remain below industry leaders. All this represents a massive opportunity to continue our momentum and double-digit growth for this brand family well into the future. During fiscal '22, we will continue to focus on making Modelo more top of mind with all consumers as we execute more high profile activations to further engage our drinkers and expand portfolio options to appeal to new consumers and unlock new occasions. These efforts will be supported by a 50% increase in digital, social and ecommerce media. Modelo will once again be an official sponsor of the Gold Cup soccer tournament, and will be a major advertiser for the brand throughout the high profile 2021 Summer Olympic Games. We will also be delivering high profile activations, to our biggest sponsorship as the official beer of the UFC. UFC's increasing popularity is allowing us to reach more young multicultural drinkers than ever. This past year, UFC reached over 41 million viewers on TV, grew their social following by 70% and became the number two largest sports property on YouTube. Modelo Chelada has been an extremely successful platform for us as well and in fiscal '22, we will take our next step on the path to growth by launching our newest flavor Modelo Chelada Pi\u00f1a Picante. Beyond Cheladas, we also have an opportunity to expand into the rapidly growing consumer trend of betterment by launching Modelo Cantarito styled cerveza, a refreshing better for you lighter lager made with a hint of real grapefruit, orange and lime juice. With only 100 calories it delivers lower calorie beer, but with a flavorful and authentic experience, as it was inspired by the traditional Cantarito cocktail from Jalisco, Mexico. And to top it off, consumers love the idea. This is the highest scoring Modelo new product concept we've ever had. As you can see, Modelo is poised for another great year in fiscal '22. Moving on to our next powerful brand family, the Corona brand family is thriving and embracing a new year full of possibilities. Our flagship Corona Extra brand remains the number six U.S. beer brand, growing IRI dollar sales by 11% and surpassing 2 billion in retail sales last year. In fiscal '22, you'll see a refreshed Corona, which will be enabled through a master brand strategy where Corona equities unite the entire family and each sub-brand delivers unique benefits to play to distinct occasions, consumers and motivations while staying true to Corona's DNA. We have a full year of master brand retail initiatives on-premise programs ready to go as markets reopen and experiential plans to play to consumers' passion points, like music and live sports. For Corona Light, our focus is on general market consumers, particularly females who seek important tastes with fewer calories. For Familiar, our focus is on acculturated Hispanics who shop in Hispanic dominant accounts. To ignite are Corona Originals, we will invest in national media spending across digital and social channels, as well as national English and Spanish language TV with a significant presence in major live sports properties such as March Madness, the NBA Finals, Gold Cup soccer and the NFL. The hotline will return to support our sports programs with Kenny Smith and Tony Romo covering the lines. Last year Corona's new La Vida M\u00e1s Fina campaign was a smashing success and brought Corona back to the center of cultural conversation. With its Snoop and Bad Bunny content, generating an impressive 1 billion impressions across TV, digital and social. Snoop and Bad Bunny will be back this year to share their fine life wisdom along with new friends. This brings us to Corona Premier; Corona's answer to capturing growth in the exploding betterment segment. In fiscal '21, Corona Premier route depletions volume almost 20% and increased its penetration at a faster rate than its major competitor and other domestic lights, demonstrating we're successfully trading up consumers. Our golf and active lifestyle platforms for this brand will be supported by a retail program, continued strong media investments in key tournaments and are distinguished sponsorship of the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June. Moving on to Refresca which is Corona's answer for flavor seekers. Because of Refresca's unique flavor experience, it has been incremental to Constellation and the category bringing in a different consumer from beer and hard seltzer with a Hispanic index of 205 versus the FMB category. So we are happy to be able to bring the Corona Refresca variety pack back in fiscal '22 after a hiatus last year during the pandemic. We will also build on the initial success of Refresca by extending the brand into the growing high ABA F&B space with the launch of Refresca M\u00c1S 24 ounce single serve cans with 8% ABA in mango citrus flavor. And this brings us to Constellation's most successful innovation yet, Corona hard seltzer. With only one SKU, the Corona hard seltzer became a number four brand family in a very short period of time, while consumers have flocked to this category, Corona's iconic image, multicultural consumer base and reputation as the number one most refreshing beer has allowed Corona hard seltzer to recruit new drinkers and expand the segment. In fact, Corona hard seltzer's year one volume delivered approximately 90% incrementality to our portfolio and continues to be the second fastest moving hard seltzer for brands with significant distribution. With no signs of slowing down, the Corona brand family expects ABAs to be a significant component in its future growth by expanding its base seltzer proposition and launching incremental innovation. We will continue to focus on growing distribution on variety pack number one, while introducing new SKUs to satisfy different tastes, occasions and channels. Our second variety pack is now in market with pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit flavors. We tested a variety of flavors and consumers told us they wanted familiar great tasting flavors that pair well with a lime from Corona. In keeping with this theme of authenticity, amplified flavor and natural betterment attributes, we're excited to announce Corona hard seltzer Limonada, which is launching in June in a 12 pack variety pack, and will be line priced with Corona hard seltzer. Inspired by traditional Mexican recipes, Limonada will break the mold by delivering authentic flavor with a splash of real lemon and lime from Mexico juice and only 100 calories. To support the expansion of all Corona hard seltzers including Limonada, we plan to invest approximately 60 million across all marketing touch points to maintain the number one share of voice in seltzers during the critical summer months and will include investment in premium sports properties, like March Madness and the NBA. The plan also includes significant levels of Spanish language support to lean into Corona strength with Hispanics. Last year, nearly 20% of Corona hard seltzers volume came from Hispanics, an index of 136 versus the seltzer category. While we're on the topic, let me address the recent lawsuit filed by one of our competitors in opposition to our use of the Corona trademark for Corona hard seltzer. Earlier this week, we filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit, as we find these claims to be completely without merit, a blatant attempt to restrain a strong and well established competitor in a high growth segment of the U.S. beer market. We have fully complied with the terms of our sub License Agreement, and we will vigorously defend our rights under our sub License Agreement and applicable law. We expect it will take several months for a court ruling on our motion to dismiss. In the meantime, we continue to operate business as usual, as we expect our plans in the ABA and hard seltzer space, where we fully expect to further build on our momentum for many years to come. Bottom line, the Corona family growth roadmap is focused on three strategic priorities in fiscal '22. First, we will reignite the core with a refresh Corona complete with new packaging best-in-class advertising, leadership levels of media and marketing investment and culturally relevant activations. Number two, we will execute breakthrough innovation which includes accelerating growth and betterment beer. And third, we will establish a beachhead in the ABA category. But let's not forget Pacifico. Let me repeat that. Let's not forget Pacifico, which is the fastest growing major Mexican import beer brand in the U.S. on a dollar sales basis and is on its way to becoming the next scalable national beer brand in the Constellation portfolio. We're doing things differently this year with the Pacifico with a focus on Gen Z consumers whose attitudes over index with Pacifico's independent spirit. Our action sports and cause initiatives resonate strongly with their passions and values. For the first time, we'll have national coverage on major Gen Z relevant digital and social platforms, including Hulu, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Twitch. This will be year four of Pacifico being the official beer of the X Games, both summer and winter. 2021 is also an Olympic trials year and we'll continue our strong partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard teams with activations at competitions across the U.S. and robust media support on NBC. I'm also excited to introduce Pacifico's first ever innovation created for Gen Z consumers with our first for new flavors. Pacifico's Citrus Agave Lager, [indiscernible] inspired and made with a hint of agave, sea salt and lime flavor. We're launching this month in two test markets San Diego and Dallas with three SKUs. We look forward to sharing these results and showing how innovation can grow the entire Pacifico portfolio. From an operational perspective, I'm pleased to announce that we recently completed the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which when added to our existing capacity provides incremental flexibility. As is typical, it will take some months to fully optimize this operation over the coming months. Because our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer market driven by ongoing robust consumer demand, we are absolutely committed to satisfying this growing consumer demand for our iconic brands, including Corona, Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria. As such, we have developed plans to invest in the next incremental capacity in Mexico that will provide long-term flexibility to equip us with the next necessary production to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in mid-to-high single digit range and is expected to continue to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. It will also provide incremental flexible capacity that will allow our breweries to operate at sensible utilization rates and deal with unplanned challenges from things like weather related issues that impacted the business during our recent fiscal year end. These have been key learnings from the pandemic. Our investments will not only support the expected future growth of our core portfolio, but for the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space and hard seltzers. Meanwhile, in addition to these initiatives, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our long-term plans for production in Mexico. Together with government officials, we're exploring options that include finding an alternative location in the southeast of Mexico that has adequate water supply and a skilled workforce. Garth will provide additional financial details in just a few minutes. To sum it up, the U.S. beer category is healthy and exhibiting strong growth led by the high-end segment. Last year off premise channels within the beer category grew 15% with the high-end growing more than 25%. The velocity of our portfolio as well as the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best-in-class. We're deliberate about our innovation efforts to ensure they're focused and disciplined and we're well positioned against where the consumer is going and the future of this industry. We have significant distribution runway for our healthy core portfolio, we will continue to capitalize on the growth of the Hispanic population and the premiumization of the U.S. middle markets. And we are focused on ABA growth leveraging our core brand equities because we see this as a significant growth opportunity as well. As a reminder, our fiscal year started March 1 and our first quarter runs through the end of May. As most of you know last year, this coincided with the beginning of the pandemic when we experienced robust consumer demand for our products that lead to record trends in off premise tracked channels as consumers were in the pantry loading phase of the pandemic. In addition during the spring of 2020, we slowed production in Mexico due to COVID which led to some out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during summer months. As a result should expect to see muted IRI and Nielsen trends early in our fiscal year due to the year-over-year unfavorable overlap until we start to overcome last year's out of stock issue when we expect our scanner data to improve significantly. However, recent four week IRI trends show the Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the total U.S. beer industry and is outperforming the high end of the beer market. Let's now move on to results of our Wine and Spirits business. Fiscal '21 was a year of significant progress for our Wine and Spirits business. The Gallo deal and related divestitures allowed us to sell several lower end brands; we established category leading digital capabilities. We optimized our route to market to accelerate performance and built a robust innovation pipeline while driving solid results in the face of a very challenging external environment. In fact, our retained Wine and Spirits portfolio excluding divested brands delivered net sales growth of 5% for the year, driven by double-digit volume growth from Meiomi, Kim Crawford and The Prisoner brand family. These same brands also achieved double-digit distribution gains in off premise channels last year. Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth and included Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford illuminate and the Prisoner Unshackled, which became the number one high-end new brand in IRI channels in fiscal '21. The Wine and Spirits business is well positioned to consistently grow net sales low to mid single digits and produce operating income growth ahead of net sales to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. This will be achieved by the business delivering a margin accretive mix, implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements. In the near term, we expect fiscal '22 organic net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. And what gives us confidence in these goals, we have solid plans in place to assure that our Wine and Spirits transformation focused on premiumization continues to gain traction. Our high-end brands are well positioned to drive mix in margin expansion. And we plan to continue to take price on select products within select markets throughout the year. We'll leverage the strong equity of these key core brands while building momentum through fully integrated marketing campaigns and partnerships to drive distinctive and consistent messaging that creates demand for these brands, including Kim, Meiomi, Woodbridge, Ruffino, the Prisoner, High West and Svedka. We remain committed to driving mix in margin accretive, scalable innovation by successfully addressing consumer trends, including the convenience RTD and betterment categories. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year that includes the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzer, the expansion of Svedka RTDs after a successful first year launch, and New Prisoner family innovation that includes the launch of the Prisoner Pinot Noir, Saldo Red Blend and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc. We also plan to benefit in year two. From this past year successful innovation launches of Meiomi Cab, Kim Crawford Illuminate and the Prisoner Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Our Wine and Spirits brand continued to outpace the ecommerce category fueled by our outstanding performance in Instacart, Drizly and Amazon, and our wine DTC growth continues to outpace the market by close to 2x. In fact, Svedka has become the number one mainstream vodka on Amazon, while Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Meiomi Pinot Noir claim number one positions in their respective categories on Drizly, one of the largest online marketplaces for beverage alcohol. The early investments we made in this space has given us a key first mover advantage, and will continue to invest in DTC and ecommerce initiatives as consumers shifts where and how they purchase beverage alcohol. The evolution of our Wine and Spirits strategy includes a critical next step to build category leading dedicated fine wines and craft spirits business which will strengthen our portfolio and capabilities in this space to meaningfully inflect our business towards the high-end. We believe that dedicating the proper focus and attention to our fine wine and craft spirits business will complement our leadership in our mainstream and premium businesses and will accelerate our goal to drive incremental profitable sales growth. As we pursue industry leading growth for our Wine and Spirits portfolio, we are constantly assessing our route to market strategies to ensure we stay ahead of consumer trends and maximize our growth opportunities. Our distributor partners play a significant role in achieving our goals and creating value for the market. To that end, we recently announced the evolution of our Wine and Spirits wholesale structure, whereby Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits assume distribution responsibilities across approximately 70% of our U.S. Wine and Spirits brand portfolio effective April 1. Southern is a proven brand builder, with advanced capabilities in growing consumer segments, including digital commerce, fine wine and craft spirits and ready to drink. And they have category leading sales capabilities across on and off premise channels. We plan to leverage their strengths in these areas to help accelerate our category leadership. We are confident they are the best partner to help us achieve our strategic ambitions and we believe this move best positions us for long-term success and accelerated growth. Moving on briefly to Canopy growth. Over the past year Canopy has made significant progress in strengthening their position in core markets and taking steps to prepare for the inevitable legalization of Cannabis in the U.S. Canopy successful rollout of Cannabis beverages as well as other [indiscernible] 2.0 products has helped the company gain momentum. Currently, Canopy has the top three beverages in the Canadian recreational market and they recently introduced their popular Quatreau CBD beverages in the U.S. Over the coming year, we look forward to benefiting from Canopy's continued March toward profitability, the rollout of Canopy branded products in the U.S. through Canopy's arrangement with acreage and the improving legal landscape for cannabis in the U.S. In closing, let me reiterate how proud I am of the performance delivered by our Constellation team, along with our distributor and retail partners during a tumultuous year. Because of their grip, passion and determination, we're operating from a position of strength as we head into the new fiscal year and we're poised to deliver a solid year of performance again, in fiscal '22. We will continue to invest aggressively to accelerate growth for our strong portfolio of industry leading brands. We have exciting innovation in-store for the coming year. And we're building capabilities in emerging channels, such as three-tier ecommerce, while adding production capacity to fuel our growth over the long-term. Make no mistake, we have bold ambitions for the future and look forward to delivering on our long-term vision, which includes generating industry leading returns for our shareholders over that timeframe. And with that, I would like now to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for fiscal '21 and our financial focus for fiscal '22. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Despite a volatile environment and various headwinds experienced throughout the year due to COVID-19, fiscal '21 marked another great year for Constellation brands demonstrated by a robust financial results and solid business performance with pretty strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, with our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum and is well positioned to execute growth now that the Gallo transaction is finally closed. Specifically, in fiscal '21, we achieved strong EPS growth and delivered comparable basis EPS excluding Canopy growth of $10.44. In addition, we generated record operating cash flow and free cash flow of 2.8 billion and 1.9 billion respectively, which enables significant debt reduction of $1.7 billion and reduction of our net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the year at 3.1x. And lastly, we returned 575 million of cash to shareholders in dividends. Now let's review full year fiscal '21 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divesture, organic net sales increased 10% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 8% in favorable price and mix. Our full year organic net sales slightly outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to incremental shipments made during the fourth quarter in order to return to normal levels of distributor inventory at fiscal year end. Depletion volume growth for the year came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of the Modelo and Corona brand families. As throughout the year, strong performance continued in the off premise channel and more than offset the impact of the 51% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. When adjusting for one less selling date in the year, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth. Moving on to beer margins, beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 41.1%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, pricing, the Ballast Point investiture and foreign currency more than offset unfavorable operational and logistic costs and mix. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by higher material costs and brewery compensation and benefits. While, the increased logistics costs predominantly resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production in fiscal '21. While, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 30 points to 9.7 versus prior year, this result landed above our previous guidance in the 9% to 9.5% range driven by incremental strategic investments made during the fourth quarter to provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season. Moving to Wine and Spirits, net sales declined 7% and shipment volume down 16%, while our retained portfolio for the year achieved net sales growth of 5% driven by double-digit volume growth and robust mixed benefits from Meiomi, Kim Crawford, the Prisoner brand family, as well as pricing benefits from Woodbridge and Svedka. Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to stronger mixed benefits and some incremental shipments of our retail brands in the fourth quarter. Depletion volume declined approximately 3% mainly driven by the brand's that recently divested, while depletion volume for our retained portfolio declined approximately 1%. The slight decline in our retained portfolio depletion volume was largely driven by strong fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1, 2020 as well as their strategic efforts made throughout the year to right size inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While, this resulted in negative impact of depletion trends for the fiscal year, this will allow for better inventory management going forward. Moving on to Wine and Spirits margins, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 24.5%, has benefits from price and mix are more than offset by higher COGS, Wine and Spirits divestitures and increased marketing and SG&A spend. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of approximately $29 million resulting from decreased production levels as the result of the wildfires. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance, finishing at approximately $229 million, up 2% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in insurance related costs and T&E spend. Couple of the basis interest expense for the year decreased 10% by approximately -- to approximately $386 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings impact came in at 18.2% versus 16.1% last year, primarily driven by a lower level of stock-based compensation benefit and higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. Stock-based compensation benefits came in slightly better than expected during Q4, in addition, we realized some small miscellaneous benefits. As a result, this drove tax break favorability versus our previous guidance. Moving to Canopy, in fiscal '21, we recognized an $802 million increase in the fair value of our Canopy investments, of which $270 million was recognized in Q4. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pre tax net gain, recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.1 billion, which increased significantly during the fiscal year driven by Canopy's robust share price movement. Now let's briefly review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to shipment volume growth of nearly 16%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture organic net sales increased 18% driven by organic shipment volume growth of approximately 17% and favorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 6%, however, when adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth, which is in line with full year trends and our medium-term growth algorithm. As you're all aware, inclement weather affected the South, predominantly Texas during the last few weeks of February. These abnormal and severe conditions did have a slight impact to our Q4 depletion trends as we're estimating that we lost approximately 50 to 100 basis points of depletion volume growth in the quarter. As previously guided, shipment volume continued to significantly outpace depletion volume during the quarter and as mentioned earlier, this resulted in distributor inventories returning to more normal levels at fiscal year end. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 36.8% as higher marketing spend and increased COGS were partially offset by benefits from favorable SG&A as a percent of net sales, the Ballast Point divesture and foreign currency. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 12.5% or 380 basis points higher than Q4 last year, driven by the shift to spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year and incremental marketing investments. Wine and Spirits net sales were down 19% for the quarter, while shipping volume was down approximately 33% reflecting the brands divested during the quarter. Our retained portfolio net sales were up 7% driven by strong shipment mix benefits as discussed earlier. Operating margin decreased 900 basis points to 19.9% primarily reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires on COGS, increased marketing and SG&A spent. In Wine and Spirits divestitures partially offset by benefits from favorable mix. Keep in mind that for approximately two-thirds of the quarter, we had a smaller business posted investitures that was burdened by the full impact of stranded costs on that smaller business. During the quarter, we also recognized a net loss of approximately 46 million in connection with smoke damage sustained during the wildfires, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. Moving to fiscal '21 free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated a record 1.9 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash flow. CapEx totaled 865 million and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately 700 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion primarily to support the Obregon 5 million hectoliter expansions. Moving to our full year fiscal '22 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal '22, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.95 to $10.25, which excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. For our beer business in fiscal '22, we are targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes one to two points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin migrating to the low to middle end of our range of 39% to 40% driven by several costs headwinds we expect to encounter in fiscal '22 due to the following. First, we are estimating a significant step up in depreciation expense, driven primarily by the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon that was recently completed. For fiscal '22, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $260 million or an increase of approximately $65 million. Second, similar to previous years, we're expecting substantial inflation headwinds in the low to mid single digit increase range, largely related to glass and other packaging materials, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico. Third, as the growth of hard seltzers and alternative beverage alcohol categories continue to rapidly expand, we expect to continue to experience unfavorable mix impacts as their margins are diluted from a gross profit perspective, due to the incremental packaging costs and flavor additives. Furthermore, we also anticipate a negative mix impact driven by incremental keg volume versus prior year driven by the continued reopening and return of business to the on-premise channel. And lastly, we expect margin headwinds related to the brewery expansion costs which include increased headcount and training expenses. To help partially offset these headwinds, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda. And as stated earlier, expect pricing benefits in the 1% to 2% range. As a result of staggering our fiscal '21 fall price increases throughout the back half of fiscal '21 and in some instances into fiscal '22, we expect to shift more pricing from the fall to the spring in fiscal '22. Lastly, as it relates to beer marketing spend from fiscal '22, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range, keep in mind that marketing spent during the first half of fiscal '21 was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19 related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and or postponements. For fiscal '22, we expect to return to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. Moving to Wine and Spirits, for fiscal '22, the Wine and Spirits business is targeting net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the Wine and Spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. The transformation of our Wine and Spirits business is underway and over the next few fiscal years, we're committed to removing stranded costs and executing against other cost savings, mix and price and efficiency improvements and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%. Other fiscal '22 guidance assumptions include interest expense in the range of $350 million to $360 million, corporate expenses to approximately $235 million, comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings of approximately 19%. Non-controlling interest is expected to be approximately $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately $196 million, this assumes no share repurchases for fiscal '22. We expect fiscal '22 free cash flow to be in the range of 1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of 2.4 billion to $2.6 billion in CapEx of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions. I think this is a good spot to elaborate on our capital expansion initiatives for our beer business that Bill touched on earlier. As Bill outlined, our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer industry driven by robust consumer demand, as such it is essential that we invest appropriately in order to support this growth for our core beer portfolio, as well as the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space. These investments include a 5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava dedicated to ABAs, including hard seltzer that is expected to be completed in early fiscal '23. And we are in the process of expanding Obregon to 19 million hectoliters to be completed by the end of fiscal '25. As a result, you should expect our annual CapEx spend for the beer business to be in the 700 million to 900 million range to support this 15 million hectoliter capacity expansion during fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '25. These projects are expected to generate solid returns as our beer business has a high operating ROIC and a best-in-class margin profile, despite the incremental depreciation expected from our CapEx investments. Even with the capital expenditures associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth allow us to remain focused on operating below our targeted leverage range, which provides us with the flexibility to execute our $5 billion cash return commitment over the next two years. Our brewery operations in Nava and Obregon have long been part of the fabric of these communities. As part of our expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we will continue working with local authorities and community based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. For instance, over the past several years, Constellation has helped support local infrastructure investments in Obregon that have enhanced water efficiency in the region, more than offsetting our water use at this facility. This is in addition to other benefits we provide including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are working with local partners in Nava on similar initiatives. Lastly, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to use or repurpose this site for future use. Therefore, we expect to take an impairment of approximately $650 million to $680 million in Q1 of fiscal '22, which will be excluded from comparable basis results. However, as Bill mentioned, we actively continue to work with government officials in Mexico to pursue various forms of recovery for the costs we have incurred in constructing the brewery and determine next steps in Mexicali. In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility as we head into fiscal '22, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders, while making strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives. Fiscal '21 was a challenging year, yet one that provided key learnings resulting from operating in a volatile environment due to the pandemic. First and foremost, the growth and margin profile of our high end beer business is best-in-class and we expect it to remain as such well into the future. In order to maintain this momentum, we are committed to an exciting innovation agenda, which includes capitalizing on the robust growth in the ABA space while continuing to support the strong growth momentum of our core beer business. This requires us to expand and optimize our production footprint, which not only sets us up for long-term growth, but provides us with contingent capacity to operate sensibly utilization rates will providing us with much needed flexibility. We believe this is the right strategy in order to support our beer business that continues to outperform the market driven by robust consumer demand and we are absolutely committed to satisfying these demands. With that Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Check to see if you are on mute Lauren, your line is open. I don't think we have her here. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So on the beer demand side, I guess short-term, we've now cycled COVID. Maybe you could just give us an update on March depletion trends and what you're seeing in April so far? And then longer term, can you touch on the growth opportunity from here on Modelo Especial, it seems to be defined the growth slowdown that happens to a lot of other brands as they get much larger. So it would just be helpful to take a look forward at the key drivers from here in terms of incremental distribution, expansion, innovation, contribution, demographics, et cetera, some of the key drivers that happened in fiscal '21 and your thought process going forward in terms of the growth drivers with that brand? Thanks. William Newlands : Absolutely. We're very pleased to say that March has gotten off to an excellent start. And March was certainly ahead of what our trend line was coming in. So we're very pleased with the start of the New Year, April, obviously, it's a little early to judge. Relative to Modelo, there's really no end in sight for its double digit growth profile. It continues to grow with the Hispanic community and obviously, it is a nice tailwind because of the growth in the Hispanic community. But we still have great distribution opportunities. We continue to grow our velocities on that brand. And when you think about the penetration increasing in the non-Hispanic community 25% over the last couple of years, we're barely scratching the surface. As you probably know, we really only started to advertise outside the Hispanic community over the last few years. So the upside within that community we think is tremendous. And as you also know, we nearly never done any innovation in that other than watching the Chelada line, which of course is quickly become the number one Chelada. We think there's just a tremendous opportunity for Modelo to continue to grow for a long time to come. It's only number three at this point. There's plenty of room still to go up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : If I may just ask about buybacks and you reiterated your $5 billion commitment, but it wasn't included in the release, I guess in terms of what buybacks are going to be for fiscal '22. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that? Garth Hankinson : Sure. Thanks, Kaumil. We are absolutely committed to meeting our $5 billion commitment over the course of the next two years. And as you know, that includes a significant amount of share repurchases $2.5 billion worth of share repurchases. As we entered this year, we said we were going to have two real commitments as it relates to capital allocation, one was paying down debt and then second was making significant progress on that return of capital. Throughout the year, as we noted, we did pay down debt quite a bit. We started the year at about 3.92x and we've ended at about 3.1x. And, we paid down the -- the Gallo transaction closed in early January, we didn't pay down the last tranche of debt, the $5 million redemption in early February. And at that point, we had some things that we were doing that we had to clear up most notably, finalizing our analysis on Mexicali, and then the subsequent, further investment in capacity. So that's why we didn't make any progress in fiscal '21. But we fully expect to make meaningful progress this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I guess I had a question on your guidance. I understand the headwinds you guys called out that are going to pressure your operating income this year, but I guess I'm trying to think through some of the levers you might have to offset these pressures, beer pricing for one comes to mind, as you called out, your pricing was softer last year, it was under 1% for the fiscal year, which is below your typical 1% to 2% range. So how should we think about your willingness to take more pricing this fiscal year to offset some of these incremental cost pressures? Would you be willing to go above your typical range? And then, finally, how much visibility do you have with some of the commodity and transportation headwinds that you're facing? Curious, are you fully hedged, for instance, on some of these commodities? William Newlands : Sure. Bonnie, I will take the first half of that. We believe the 1% to 2% pricing actions that we take pretty much on an annual basis is the smart way to approach it, it balances the opportunity to get improved revenue scenarios with the recognition that, you do have some price sensitivity within certain consumer groups that consume our brands. So you always walk that delicate balance of where you go. And our view is 1% to 2% is a good amount that allows us to continue to maintain the strong momentum within our business that we have. As you know, we continue also to aggressively increase our spend overall against our marketing platforms. And that will only be expanded when you think about some of the innovation agenda. So we're very optimistic about the whole platform. But we're getting much beyond that, I think in any one year, it is probably not the best way to approach that question. And Garth, you might answer her second please. Garth Hankinson : Sure. Just on the opportunities on the hedging, Bonnie, so first of all, every year, our ops teams and our production teams are looking for ways to take costs out of the business, still continue to look for those as we go through the year. So those are possible levers as we move forward. But quite candidly, those cost savings get harder and harder as time goes on. As it relates to our hedging position. As you know, we have a fairly robust and sophisticated hedging policy that allows us to layer in hedges on both commodities and on currencies over the course of many years to take advantage of favorable rates. So we've done that in order to mitigate what otherwise may have been higher inflation this year. That being said, we're not fully hedged in any one thing, whether that's currency or commodities. And so to the extent that there are any improvements as rates, we could benefit from those as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : My question for you just related to Mexicali and I guess, just trying to think through, of the -- I guess roughly $800 million that we've spent there, in terms of just cash back -- what are the sort of opportunities to maybe recapture some of that cash, whether it's repurposing the equipment, the land \u2013 maybe selling land? Also, will there be any cash tax benefit? You basically wrote that off as a loss and then there's a cash tax benefit, just trying to understand how much of that cash we could think about you recouping over the next year or two? William Newlands : So obviously, Bryan, we continue to work to mitigate that impairment, but obviously we felt it was time to take that impairment. We have repurposed a number of the equipment things that we have there into other facilities as part of our expansion of the other facilities. And we're going to -- we're continuing discussions with the government as well, relative to mitigating the impairment for the future as well. But I do think it's important to note one thing, though, we're not going to let this setback and admittedly, we're not happy about it. We're not going to let this get in the way of focusing on our growth and meeting the growth and high demand that we have for our brands over the long-term. The reason where we're doing the capacity expansion that Garth talked about previously, is because our demand continues to be aggressive, A, on our core business, and B, we're going to get after the ABA/seltzer space, in an even more aggressive way than we have up to this point. So we're not going to let this get in the way of us meeting consumer demand for our brands in the future. Garth, do you want to comment on that one? Garth Hankinson : Yes. Just as it relates to further recovery. So first of all, the impairment kind of is net of what we think we've recovered to-date, right. So we have been moving equipment out of Mexicali and over to Obregon, in support of the 5 million hectoliters that just went live. We continue to do that to support further expansion at Obregon. And really taking the impairment is -- and making the decision to move on is the first step in further evaluating what our next options are, which, as you indicated, could include things like selling the land and whatnot. And then, just further as it relates to any the negotiation of the conversations, I should say that the Bill referenced, we do expect that there will be some additional recovery in that --recovery could come in many different forms, it could come in cash payments, it could come in tax credits, it could come in infrastructure credits, things of that nature. So, we're certainly not done, as it relates to trying to recover any lost costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen. Vivien Azer : My question is on your margins, understanding that there some very clear structural headwinds that you're contending with and even to offset with cost savings. I am a little bit surprised that your E&P guidance is not a little bit higher, given the substantial amount of new product activity. So I was hoping you could just elaborate on kind of what informed the range in order of magnitude how you're thinking about prioritizing that spend. Garth Hankinson : I'm sorry, Vivien, I was trying to understand the question. So I think what I heard you say you're asking the question around what's driving the, or trying to get a sense for that the scale of what's driving the margin dilution. So as we said, about a third of the dilution is driven by the inflation, which we discussed, about a third of that is coming from the increase in depreciation. And then, a third of that is from the mix impact moving towards seltzers and ABAs. William Newlands : Well, advertising is going to be consistent going forward with what our historical trends have been in that sort of mid nine's range. We're obviously in a growth business like ours, that's still a significant increase year-on-year on what the total spend is, because it's coming off a very much higher top-line than it was in the prior year. So we're actually spending a lot more in our marketing spend than we had in prior years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : I wanted to drill down on your views for the hard seltzer category, if I could. Three part question. So one, has the category slowdown that we're seeing in the Nielsen data in the first quarter? Is that in line with your expectations, obviously, very difficult year-over-year comparisons, but that being said, still moderating. Two, what are you forecasting for the seltzer category this year? What's embedded in your outlook? And then, the last piece is maybe touch on your level of satisfaction with your market share at this point, understandably, you're leaning in now, you talked about the $60 million ad campaign. That being said, as we look at the Nielsen data your market share is hovering in the 3% area. How is that relative to your expectations? Where do you expect that to go here over the next 12 months? William Newlands : Sure, two or three of those things, we'll try to get them all. It's not unexpected in a category that's continuing to bring in new consumers that you have some seasonality effects. We certainly saw greater seasonality effect over this recent period than we saw a year ago as an example. Our view is, that's likely because you have a significant higher percentage of either early or less consistent user. So it wasn't really a surprise, it still remains a growth sector within the beer industry. Our forecast it's going to continue to grow and continue to be a very important part, which is why we're more than doubling our capabilities against hard seltzer for this particular year coming, that we're just starting. We believe this is going to be an important part. And it also provides an interesting entree for people into the overall beer category. Relative to the market share, as you know, as we expanded our capabilities that allowed us to do additional SKUs, we did almost 10 million cases this past year with one SKU, which is kind of an outstanding launch, if you will. But the expansion that we are putting in place is going to allow us to more than double that we've already introduced SKU number two and number two variety pack, and we have Limonada coming online, here this coming June. So our expectations is, you'll see a significant increase in our share proposition, in part because we'll have more available to the consumer. And we'll have more shelf space on the warm shelf and more cold back space in the cold box as well. So we're very optimistic about what our profile will look like as the year goes on. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Kevin, just to follow up on that really quickly, so that the growth that you're seeing so far is, fairly well, in line with what we're expecting. We're expecting growth in the category this year to be in that 40% to 50% range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Sean King : I guess with your fiscal year ending, since then, seems like the market has opened up quite a bit, I guess, I'd love to know a bit more about what you're seeing in the on-premise. And also within that any change in distributor inventory level, then the more markets reopen? William Newlands : You're starting to see difference and obviously, it varies by state. So for instance, it got a little tighter in California in the early part of this calendar year than we had anticipated, but overall, we're starting to see some increase in the on-premises, you would expect recalling that sort of it's going against the time last year when it was off more than 50%. So we certainly would expect some of that. I think that the open question, it's very difficult to predict, quite frankly, is where the all the whole channel mix ends up going. It's an open question. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise channel than some of our competitors, because our overall profile is SKUs more to the off-premise anyway. But certainly, we're optimistic and as more of the U.S. population gets vaccinated, we're hopeful that in the summer months, it begins to look a little bit more like what a typical year would be. But it's still a little early to make that call. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Just two follow ups, one for each of you. Bill, can you talk a little bit more about Pacifico, on every call, you get progressively more excited about it, which is great. Can you talk maybe, sort of the reasons to believe that it's going to be a major national brand? And then, Garth maybe touch on how you're thinking about the mix between share buybacks and dividends? It seems evident from the release just a 1% dividend increase. Why so little and is that just, the way you're looking at things is that you'd much rather prefer share buybacks particularly at the depressed valuation of the equity. William Newlands : Well, Robert, Patty always warns me about being too giddy, but I must say it's tough not to be giddy when you look at some of the results around Pacifico. Consistently you're seeing four week trends in IRI that are up in the 30 plus percent range. That the core business in Southern California continues to do extremely well and it's developing across the country. Again, we really just are scratching the surface of building out with this brand to be. But my old friend Bill Hackett always said Pacifico, starting to look a lot like Modelo looked about 15 to 20 years ago in terms of the development and how it really started out in the California bases. Modelo is now the number one brand in the state of California. I'm not making a prediction that Pacifico will be the number one brand, but it wouldn't be the worst thing that ever happened. So I certainly -- there's just a lot to be excited about you, you then add in that we're starting to do some innovation and some innovation testing in that brand with Gen Z consumers. This brand very much over indexed with Gen Z consumers. So we're bringing in a somewhat different audience than what we have with some of our other franchises. So, again, it's early days, but there's just so much to be excited about with Pacifico. We really think this could easily be the next big franchise within our overall portfolio. Garth, over to you. Garth Hankinson : Sure. And on the sort of capital allocation question regarding share buybacks and dividends. I mean, look in the construct of everything we're trying to do from a capital allocation standpoint is, we want to make sure that we maintain investment grade, we want to make sure that we return to shareholders what we previously said we would return to shareholders, which was about 2.5 billion of share buybacks and 2.5 billion of dividends. And we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in our business, as we talked about investing significantly in Mexico to support the robust growth of our portfolio. So all of that goes into the mix when we're trying to decide where to spend the money. And as it relates, specifically to dividends, versus share buybacks, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our payout ratio right in the target of what we've set for ourselves. So that's why we didn't increase it more. And by keeping it where we are, we're able to do all those other things that I said, return a significant amount of money in share repurchases, invest behind the brand, maintain our investment grade rating. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the prior answers. I guess, just one, I'm trying to understand what's embedded from an off-premise and on-premise standpoint for next year, it seems like, even if you get half of the on-premise back, you're looking for only low to mid [teen digitally] [ph] off-premise. And if on-premise comes back and full, off-premise basically, implies did not grow next year. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is, is that just a construct of difficult comps, in the off-premise? Or is there something else in play? Because clearly, commentary from the trade seems positive, Nielsen scanner was good even on, COVID comps, you get innovation coming through. So I'm just trying to understand that. And if I could sneak one and just on distributor inventory, you mentioned that inventory seemed back at the levels where you want to but at the same time, the trade would suggest that you're still trying to catch up. Can you just add a little bit more perspective around that? William Newlands : Sure. So let's start with the inventory, our inventory levels came out last year at roughly a normal level. And we expect that it will stay roughly within that range, we have no major change in expectations about changing inventory. Relative to on-premise, remember, today, it's only 6% of our business as it currently stands, because of the significant decrease that's occurred based on COVID. So our expectation is, we're still going to see very robust growth in the off-premise, during this fiscal year. And as you've seen, we're consistent with our long-term growth algorithm that we've seen already stated March is off to an excellent start. So we're very optimistic about that algorithm. But with that said, it's also going to be difficult to exactly predict what will happen with the on-premise, because we've already seen as markets have opened and then closed a little bit and reopened, there's just a lot of variability that's hard to predict. Again, while there is an over expression in the off premise, that isn't the worst thing for us, our business is over skewed into that area. And we continue to expect robust growth within the off-premise channel for this for this fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I wanted to just -- since we've covered a lot of grounds on beer, a bit on Wine and Spirits. What are you seeing with the reopening and also anything in terms of the switch between at home and on-premises, anything about promos and how you're going to position your focus brand? William Newlands : Well, the biggest switching that we've seen is a significant increase in three tier ecommerce. As we said in my prepared remarks, we were quite pleased the fact that we got way ahead of that we were already investing against that capability. And we've accelerated that investment, which really in our view gives us a first mover advantage in this particular area. And you're seeing that change, I'm sure just as a shopper, we've all seen in-store a significant increase of Instacart, click and collect and some of those alternate ways of people buying considering how they used to buy. Direct to consumer is also up, we're pleased that we are performing at more than 2x the growth profile of DTC and we've also invested in that area, you'll recall earlier, last fiscal year, we bought Empathy, in part to radically improve our capabilities in the direct to consumer. And we are now leveraging that across many of our other brands. So we're very excited about those opportunities and that being an increasingly important part of the future of the Wine and Spirits business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with DB. Steve Powers : Maybe just to round out and build on the capacity expansion discussion. You start early with Bryn, if I think just out beyond the fiscal '23 to '25 plans at Nava and Obregon. Is it fair to assume that additional expansion would take shape outside those two facilities? Or is there more room to expand those locations? And I guess in terms of those new locations, Bill, I think you mentioned exploration of future sites in the southeastern part of Mexico, which I think is consistent with preferences that have been expressed by the Mexican government. But just can you elaborate on your considerations there because if does play out, you'd be shipping long distances to get to the southern border of the states. And just thinking -- just want to think through how you're thinking about overcoming those dynamics just to preserve overall efficiency? William Newlands : Well, let's put a little bow on the whole scenario about building out our capabilities. One of the things that we've been quite good at over the last several years, is running our plants at hyper efficiency. But I think one thing is learning from the pandemic. And I think any good business should have an element of learning when something hits you in the face and the pandemic certainly did that across many, many, many industries. One of the things we learned is, well, our efficiency was tremendous; we didn't have a lot of flexibility in the event that something didn't go well. And so one of the pieces that we are doing with this expansion is not only to meet the hyper growth that we have within our business, but also to create some increasing flexibility and some redundancy within our business. So that if you have weather challenges, or God forbid, we had another pandemic, but if you had weather challenges, or some other curveballs that occurred, it would have minimal to no impact on our ongoing supply. So that was very important. Relative to the southeast, we are considering that it's critically important to have water supply, it's actually a lot of shipping capabilities to some of the areas that we are looking into. So we're pretty confident that could very well be a future location for a brewery for us. Admittedly, that's a bit out, it takes two to four years to even get that process going and underway. But we're certainly evaluating it because we think it could be a long-term very viable solution for our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Laurent Grandet : So like to actually follow-up on Kevin's question on the seltzer category. So last year, when you launched Corona seltzer, you said you will spend about [$40 million] [ph] to use the brand. So a year later Corona seltzer is about 2.5% of market share in the last four weeks and SCV is down 60%. So what makes you believe that with two new SKUs, one being launched late in the season just in June, and spending about $50 million, which by the way, we'd be happy share of voice of last year, you will be more successful. And actually what success would look like for you in the fiscal year 2021 in seltzer? William Newlands : Sure. Well, let's keep in mind that 60 million, that'll be the number one share of voice in the seltzer category during the critical season. So, our view is that's a very important and loud efforts against that particular sector. Secondly, again, you got to keep in mind, we produced everything we could possibly produce last year and we sold it. It was probably the most successful introduction the company's ever had with the corona hard seltzer. So we were very pleased with our position. What we did see is there remained a lot of opportunity, it remains a growing sector in the beer business, we only have one SKU expanding our footprint to meet more consumer needs and occasions and flavor profiles was going to be very important. And it also gives us the chance to get expanded reach and velocity at both warm shelf and in the cold call box. So we think having the number one share of voice in this particular category, coupled with our new introductions that are coming this year, we're very excited about what our share profile will look like as the year goes on. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Newlands for closing remarks. William Newlands : Thanks very much. And thank you all for joining the call today. I know it was a bit longer than some of them. As a result of our continued robust performance and financial discipline this past year, Constellation Brands achieved strong earnings growth generated record cash flow and significantly reduced our debt providing solid momentum as we head into fiscal 22. Our beer business has an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year and we expect our core portfolio to continue to generate robust growth as well as we've talked earlier today. In order to satisfy this robust consumer demand, we have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion and we are pleased to be in the position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform. Our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during this past fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower end wine brands positions this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward. We look forward to speaking with all of you again in late June when we will share the results of our first quarter of our new fiscal year. Before then, we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco Se Mayo and Memorial Day and let us all hope they are a bit more normal. Thanks again and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions, instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jiji [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's first-quarter fiscal '22 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to everyone to our first quarter conference call. Picking right up where we left off in Q4, our Constellation Brands' team with the help of our distributors and retailers delivered another strong performance in Q1 of fiscal '22. While we overlap the pantry-loading phase of the pandemic, which led to record trends in off-premise tracked channels last year, our continued focus on brand building, aggressive investments in growth, and the continued efforts of our team and trade partners positioned us to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. As Garth and I detailed some of the highlights from Q1, there are several key factors we'd like you to keep in mind that constitute our points of differentiation, our competitive strengths, and reasons to continue to believe in the future growth potential of our business and our ability to drive industry-leading, total shareholder returns over the long-term. Number one, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain momentum while offering significant runway for growth in the years ahead. Nowhere is this more evident than in our beer business, which is off to an exceptional start delivering double-digit depletions, shipments, net sales, and operating income growth due to ongoing strong consumer demand. Number two, we continue to be relentless about keeping consumers at the forefront of our decision making, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the strides we're making to strengthen our innovation capabilities and ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. Number three, our investment in Canopy Growth along with the continued efforts of the Canopy team are positioning this business to emerge as a leader in the global cannabis market as it comes to fruition and we inch closer to legalization in the US. And number four, our continued strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity with significant repurchases of more than $500 million during the first four months of our fiscal year. In addition, we announced this morning that we will execute an accelerated share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the second quarter to repurchase an additional incremental $500 million of shares. We believe this demonstrates our strong commitment to maximize shareholder value, and we are on our way to achieving our $5 billion goal of which about 50% will be in the form of share repurchases. This activity is also driving an increase in our EPS guidance for this year. Let's transition to a more detailed discussion of our performance in the quarter. As mentioned, our beer business is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit net sales and operating income growth as well as depletion growth of almost 11% in the quarter. Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays led to market share gains as Constellation remains a leading growth driver in the high end of the US beer market. Modelo Especial led the way as the number one share gainer in the entire US beer category and solidified its position as the number one brand in the high-end. It also became the number two brand in dollar sales in IRI channels, posting depletion growth of 12% for the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to fire on all cylinders with no signs of letting up driven by ongoing strong execution of retail, impactful execution of high-profile marketing activations, and a significant increase in digital, social, and e-commerce media for properties like UFC, Gold Cup soccer, and the Summer Olympic Games to name just a few. Corona brand family growth was driven by a return to growth in on-premise channels, which now represent approximately 11% of our beer business volume, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. During the quarter, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which continues to gain shelf space and is already more than half the size of Variety Pack #1 in dollar sales and appears to have about the same incrementality as Variety Pack #1 has to the entire portfolio. Meanwhile, Variety Pack #1 has held its distribution and velocity levels since the launch of Variety Pack #2, and our Hard Seltzer family remains in the number four market position. Earlier this month, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada, and while it's early in the launch cycle, initial consumer response has been very favorable. Ultimately, we believe the Hard Seltzer category will be dominated by a few large brands in the long run, similar to the light beer category, and we are positioning Corona Hard Seltzer to be one of those brands. We have plans to more than double our Seltzer and ABA capabilities this fiscal year and expect to bring another 5 million hectoliters of capacity online next fiscal year giving us the flexibility to continue to expand with new flavors, new packages, and even new platforms in this space. Overall, the Seltzer category remains competitive. We believe it's an important part of the high-end, and we plan to drive for success with our ambition to ultimately be a top-three player in this space. Pacifico continued it's strong momentum posting depletion growth of more than 35% for the quarter as the number four share gainer within the import segment driven by our focus on Gen Z consumers. As expected, during the quarter, Constellation's consumer takeaway trends in the off-premise IRI and Nielsen channels were muted due to lapping last year's pantry loading behavior at the start of the pandemic. Conversely, we experienced robust growth, especially in some of the more sizable, non-tracked channels, including the on-premise which grew depletions 250% versus last year when this channel was essentially closed and the liquor chains, which grew almost 13% in the first quarter. These levels of robust consumer demand are impacting availability for certain packet sizes and certain geographies. We are working with our distributor partners to ensure consumers can continue to find our brands on shelf throughout the summer, and we plan to make up some of this impact beginning in the third quarter. As a reminder, beginning in April of last year, our beer business had to significantly slow down production in Mexico due to COVID-19 restrictions. This led to out of stocks in the US marketplace during the summer month. Therefore, as we progress through our second quarter, which runs June through August, we'll start to lap these out-of-stock issues, and we're already beginning to see improving IRI trends. Despite the short-term supply challenges we're facing, the momentum of our portfolio is stronger than ever, and our outlook for the remainder of the year remains extremely bullish. Our view is reinforced by recent four-week IRI trends that show Constellation's beer business is outpacing the high-end and continues to significantly outpace the total US beer industry. Now, moving on to wine and spirits. Our transformation of this business to a higher growth, higher margin operation continues to gain traction, and we made additional progress during the first quarter on a number of fronts, including furthering our fine wine and craft spirits strategy, building a robust innovation pipeline, advancing our DTC e-commerce and digital capabilities, while also implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements. During the quarter, we made progress with the evolution of our fine wine and craft spirits business, especially as consumers returned to bars and restaurants in the on-premise channel. Our fine wine and craft spirits performance in the quarter was driven primarily by The Prisoner Wine Company, Robert Mondavi Winery, and High West. And we expect our enhanced capabilities in this space to begin to meaningfully inflect our wine and spirits business towards the higher end. Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth during the quarter, including Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, and The Prisoner Unshackled which were among the top 10 innovations across the high end of the US wine segment in IRI channels during the quarter. And we have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the remainder of the year, which includes the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzers, The Prisoner's Saldo, Red Blend, and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc plus Robert Mondavi Private Selection 100, a new lineup composed of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals. We've also been investing to build a world-class three-tier e-commerce team by expanding our sales and marketing resources, building new selling capabilities, investing millions of dollars where consumers shop, and integrating our teams to put focus and expertise closer to our accounts. While our three-tier e-commerce business is cycling the tremendous acceleration that was experienced last spring at the beginning of the pandemic, it is still growing 3 to 4 times compared to the spring of 2019 across beer, wine, and spirits. And the DTC portion of our e-commerce business saw impressive growth of 45% versus last year in the first quarter. We continued to forge partnerships with existing and emerging pure-play retailers like Amazon, Gopuff, and Wine.com. Omnichannel retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons. And third-party marketplaces like Instacart and Drizly so that our consumers can shop whenever and wherever on their own terms. In addition, as part of our commitment to invest $100 million over 10 years and Black, Latinx, and minority-owned small businesses, we recently made investments in La Fete du Rose and Sapere Aude Sparkling Wine, both of these brands aligned with Constellation's premiumization strategy and present significant growth opportunities with differentiated high-end brands in growing sectors of the market. La Fete du Rose has taken a consumer-first approach to building a distinctive, authentic Rose brand that appeals to multicultural consumers. And Sapere Aude has taken an entrepreneurial approach to build a uniquely Californian sparkling wine with no residual sugars, low alcohol content, fine bubbles, and a refreshing brand identity that is simple and clean. We look forward to working with these brands and their dynamic founders to expand our access to key markets and consumers, and to help realize their full potential. At the same time, our Wine & Spirits results for the quarter were impacted by a convergence of isolated factors. First, our international brands like Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are produced in their respective regions but sold primarily in the US are experiencing global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions like so many other imported products. Second, we've experienced some start-up issues in certain markets associated with our route to market transition to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, which now has distribution responsibilities across 70% of our US Wine & Spirits brand portfolio. This transition became effective April 1, and we expect the transition issues to be resolved in the second quarter. Lastly, like many ERP system implementations with a cut over to SAP, we have encountered a few transitional challenges which we don't see as a prolonged issue. Collectively, these issues caused some supply challenges in retail for some of our larger key brands which drove the negative depletion trend during the quarter. And while we are seeing lower inventory levels than normal for Kim and Ruffino, they continue to drive growth. Despite these temporary challenges, we are confident in our ability to accelerate the growth and profitability of this higher-end portfolio of industry-leading brands and achieving our targeted goal of 2% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Moving on to Canopy Growth; the synergies between Constellation and Canopy Growth continue to create value for both companies. Canopy recently signed a US distribution agreement with Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits for Canopy's Quattro CBD beverage portfolio which will be launched across seven US states with additional states to be added later this year, as well as their Martha Stewart CBD product lineup, which has seen early success extending into top-selling gifts for occasions, including Mother's Day and Valentine's Day was sold out prior to the holidays due to high consumer demand. Constellation and Canopy will continue to work closely together to develop Canopy's route to market strategy in the US. We remain optimistic about the prospects for federal US legalization during this congressional session and are bullish about Canopy's growth prospects and their ability to achieve profitability by the end of their fiscal year. As I close, I want to take a minute to thank our Constellation team members and our distributors and retailers for an excellent first quarter of business performance. Thanks to all of you, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain momentum and we are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the US beer market and will delivering market share gains and accelerating depletion trends as consumer demand and take away remains extremely strong. Our higher-end Wine & Spirits brands continue to outpace the overall US market. We continue to strengthen our innovation capabilities to ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. Our continued strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and drove an increase in our EPS guidance for the year. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill. And hello, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation. As Bill highlighted, our Beer business achieved double-digit depletion volume, top-line, and operating income growth. Our Wine & Spirits business is nicely positioned to drive accelerated growth and profitability from its portfolio of higher-end industry-leading brands, and our robust cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity, reaffirming our commitment to execute our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through our fiscal 2023. As Bill outlined, through June, we've repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $523 million. In addition, this morning we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR agreement to purchase $500 million of incremental shares which is expected to be completed no later than October of 2021. Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes of $500 million incremental share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. As a result, we've increased our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.30. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and reflects the decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, driven by the year -- the June year-to-date share buyback activity as well as the ASR agreement or approximately $1 billion of share repurchases. As such, we are forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $193 million for our fiscal 2022. We plan to repurchase additional shares during the back half of the fiscal year in excess of the $1 billion of share repurchases previously outlined. However, we do not know the timing and cadence, and as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. Now, let's review our Q1 fiscal 2022 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with Beer, net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of over 11% and favorable pricing. The increase in beer net sales was impacted by some miss shipping days and supply shortages as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico, early in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Depletion volume accelerated from fiscal 2021 year-end trends and achieved nearly 11% growth for the quarter despite overlapping the peak of last year's pandemic-related pantry loading behavior, driven by continued strong demand in both tracked and non-tracked off-premise channels, as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for 11% of total beer depletions during the quarter, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 3% of our depletion volume in Q1 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns due to COVID-19. Lastly, when adjusting for one extra selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated nearly 10% depletion volume growth, and in Q2 depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. Due to continued robust consumer demand and muted shipment volume driven by supply challenges due to severe winter weather early in the quarter, depletion volume exceeded shipment volume during the first quarter, resulting in lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of Q1. Let me assure you, that we are fully producing and shipping products out of our breweries, however, inventories will remain tight throughout the second quarter as we enter our peak summer selling season. As a result, we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the second half of the fiscal year. Moving on to beer margins; beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 42.8%. Benefits from favorable pricing, SG&A as a percent of net sales, and foreign currency were partially offset by unfavorable logistics and operational costs and increased marketing. The increase in logistics cost was driven primarily by increased obsolescence resulting from initial conservative expiration dates on new SKUs, partially offset by the transition of a portion of our co-packing capabilities to our Nava Brewary. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by brewery costs, largely due to labor inflation in Mexico and increased headcount and incremental spend to bring the additional 5 million hectoliters online at Obregon. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to the overlap of reduced production in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 safety measures. Depreciation expense had a minimal impact during the quarter as we began to depreciate the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon late in Q1 but expect depreciation expense to ramp up during Q2. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 9.4% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. As communicated last quarter, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to repurpose this site for future use. As such, an impairment of approximately $665 million was recorded for the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. For full year fiscal 2022, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9% which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin to land in the low to mid-point of our stated 39% to 40% range. As previously discussed, we continue to expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following headwinds. First, a significant step up in depreciation expense and other brewery expansion costs relating to the incremental 5 million hectoliters that was completed at Obregon earlier in the fiscal year. Second, substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components. And lastly, negative mix as we expand our ABA and Hard Seltzer portfolios. As it relates to timing and cadence, as mentioned earlier, during the second quarter we will begin to see an impact from depreciating the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon, which will be a significant margin headwinds for the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, due to benefits from our commodity hedging program, we did not experience the expected cost inflationary pressures during this quarter. However, we expect significant inflation headwinds to ramp up during the second half of our fiscal year as current hedges roll off. In addition, we believe the depth and duration of inflationary pressures are becoming more uncertain as the year unfolds. Lastly, we continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for full year fiscal 2022 which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. We expect to invest significantly during Q2 of fiscal 2022 to support strategic initiatives and continue generating strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As such, 2Q marketing as a percent of net sales is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal '21 which came in 8.4%. Moving to Wine & Spirits; Q1 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 22% on shipment volumes down 38%. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 16% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 6%, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales, and favorable price and mix, while depletion volume declined approximately 8%. There are several dynamics to point out as it relates to organic net sales as well as shipment and depletion volume trends for the quarter. Starting with organic net sales and organic shipment volume; growth of 16% and 6% respectively was impacted by the following. First, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales accounted for approximately 4 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth in the quarter. Second, from an organic shipment volume perspective, we under shipped depletions in Q1 fiscal 2021 as we were unable to fulfill excessive consumer demand driven by pantry loading, creating easy shipment volume compared to Q1 fiscal 2022. Conversely, we over shipped in Q1 fiscal 2022 as a result of the distributor transitioned to Southern Glazer's in order to ensure that they had ample inventory during the quarter as there was a delay in transitioning Constellation inventory from canceled distributors to Southern Glazer's. Moving to depletion volume trends; down approximately 8%, which were impacted by the following. First, we are experiencing a challenging overlap to the last year's pandemic-related consumer pantry loading behavior. Second, as a result of the SAP transition, we experienced challenges that impacted the shipping process early in the quarter. While we were able to rectify the situation during the quarter, the timing of shipments throughout Q1 negatively impacted depletions and created out of stocks for some of our larger key brands. Lastly, global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions have also created out of stocks in certain areas for Kim Crawford and Ruffino which are imported from New Zealand and Italy respectively. As Bill mentioned, we believe these challenges are temporary and continue to improve, and we expect to refill retailer inventory in Q2. Moving on to Wine & Spirits margins; operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 22.9% as mixed benefits driven by the Wine & Spirits divestitures and favorable price were more than offset by margin dilutive smoke-tainted wine -- bulk wine sales and increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower marketing and SG&A spend in Q1 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging impacting operating margins. For full year fiscal 2022, the Wine & Spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margin to approximate 24% which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. Lastly, please keep in mind that we will continue to lap significantly reduced marketing spend during Q2 as many of our planned media and event sponsorship investments were suspended or canceled in Q2 fiscal 2021. Furthermore, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result from the Wine & Spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q2 fiscal 2022. Now, let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Q1 corporate expenses came in approximately $55 million, up 8% versus Q1 fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. We continue to expect full year corporate expenses to approximately $235 million. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 13% to approximately $87 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our net leverage ratio and ended the quarter at 3.06 times, excluding Canopy equity earnings. Our previous guidance assumed free cash flow would be used to pay down debt versus share repurchases. However, as discussed earlier, updated guidance now reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases through the first half. As such, fiscal [ph] interest expense is now expected to increase and be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.1% versus 19.3% last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We expect our Q2 fiscal '22 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact to approximate 20%. However, we continue to expect the full year to approximate 19% as expected stock-based compensation benefits are weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $602 million, which represents an 11% increase versus prior year reflecting strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $114 million or 21% last year spend. This included approximately $86 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Lower CapEx spend is primarily due to timing, as we have significant spending plan for the balance of the fiscal year. As such, our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. Moving to Canopy; in Q1 we recognized an unrealized loss of $745 million from the decrease in the fair value of our Canopy investments. This was excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $366 million. In closing, I want to reiterate our expectations to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility throughout our fiscal 2022, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders, while making strategic investments to support long-term growth opportunities. We believe the combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects in both our Beer and Wine & Spirits businesses positions Constellation for success. The growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class and we expect it to remain as such well into the future while the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business is underway and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi, everyone. William Newlands : Hey, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. I was actually just hoping to get a little more color on the out-of-stock pressures you've been facing. We're aware that you guys had temporarily paused [ph] orders during the end of May given how strong demand was in relation to your forecasted supply. So, first, are these caps still in place? And then specifically, have you seen these pressures maybe get better or worse in June? And finally, are there any specific impacts on certain SKUs or pack sizes or was this just more broad-based in your portfolio? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. Obviously, the two main things driving the tightness of inventory are first and foremost, robust consumer demand. Our consumer demand has been well in excess of what we anticipated. And in my opinion, that's always good news. The second piece of that obviously was the point that Garth made and I made in my script, which is the power outage that occurred at the end of February, which has made for a somewhat tighter inventory position than we would normally want to hold. With that said, all of that will take care of itself over the course of the fiscal year. It's quite different, quite frankly, from last year where we mainly produced the SKUs that represented 75% of our total portfolio. This year, we're producing all of our SKUs. So, it's very different from what we saw last year, and while we do expect tightness during the course of the summer, we're working actively with our distributors to make sure that we are providing the right mix of product to make sure that we continue to supply the very strong demand we're seeing against our portfolio. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nik Modi : Yes. Good morning, everyone. So, just quick housekeeping, Bill, you wouldn't mind sharing perspective on June depletions. I know the month isn't over yet, but any early color would be helpful? And then, the broader question is, during the pandemic, many brands including Constellation's portfolio of beer brands gained a lot of new households, and I was just wondering have you done a postmortem on what those new households look like? Have you recruited new consumers into the portfolio that you weren't recruiting prior? I mean any context around that would be really interesting. William Newlands : Certainly. So, first -- your first part of your question regarding June, and you're correct, well it isn't over yet. We're very enthused by how June is setting up and is certainly consistent with our long-term algorithm assuming we finished the last couple of days strongly. So, we think June is going to look pretty good. Secondly, relative to households, Nik, we obviously are continuing to develop and broaden our reach across our core brands, particularly in beer. If you think about Modelo, and Garth I think said this in prior quarters, we are rapidly increasing our penetration in the non-Hispanic community. It's a little difficult for us at this point to break that out of how much of that was COVID versus non-COVID because we're just seeing such an acceleration of Modelo not only in its core Hispanic market but in the broader market as well. So, it's a little difficult for us to put an exact percentage on any of those things. What I would say is, we are gaining consumers in our portfolio that has been obvious, and we expect that trend to continue. Part of that has been driven by our innovation agenda. We are meeting more consumer needs, more consumer drinking occasions than we ever have before because of our successful innovation agenda across the whole portfolio, across the company. So, I would expect that we're going to continue to see some acceleration of bringing new consumers in because we are opening up occasions for those people to come into our franchise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious about the beer pricing. It\u2019s price mix was north of 2%, and I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about how much of that was driven by mix or if there is some greater pricing starting to come through in the market and your thoughts broadly on pricing for beer this year? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. We continue to keep our algorithm about beer pricing as we have said on prior calls. We see it as a 1% to 2% growth profile over the course of the year, and we're sticking with that. We think that's appropriate given all the factors that we weigh when we decide about what we're going to do with our pricing. I think it's also important to say our number one growth driver in our business continues to be Modelo, which is very accretive on a mix basis. So, as we continue to see all of our businesses grow, when you see that kind of acceleration in Modelo, it certainly is mix accretive to us as well. So, I think both of those things were additive in the quarter, and we would expect them to be additive over the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey. Thanks, everybody. Digging into the supply or maybe connecting the supply issues with depletions and how you're thinking about inventories getting better in the back half, does that -- think that you being running at a 10, looks like you are continuing to run at [indiscernible] adjusted, do you need depletions to really start to come off, maybe back to that high-single-digit range to get inventories back to where you want them to be or do you feel like just the abatement of any of the supply pressures will be able to get you to where you want to be? Thanks. William Newlands : We'd expect that the abatement of supply issues to take care of themselves over the course of the year. Remember, I think we probably made this reasonably clear. We lost several points of top-line growth because of the power outage that occurred at the end of February in Northern Mexico and in Texas. So, we certainly had a muted shipping scenario. We will expect to pick that up over the course of the remainder of the year. And we're still expecting demand to be very solid. So, we are fully expecting to meet the demand that we'll see in the marketplace, which we continue to say will be in that 7% to 9% range over the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Your line is now open. Sean King : Great, thanks for the question. Yes, I appreciate the color you gave on the on-premise at 11% and I guess that's greater than 250% growth for beer. But was that at the close of the quarter? Is that like the average of the quarter overall? And inside that, what are you seeing in terms of draft amount [ph]? William Newlands : Yes, that's the average over the course of the quarter. As Garth pointed out in his remarks, that still is below what we were pre-pandemic but it's a really big increase to what it was last year. So, we still think certain markets are developed more quickly than others as we've said in prior discussions, as well. So, we certainly expect that's going to continue to be an accelerator over the course of the summer. And let's face it, I think it would be fair to say there's a lot of pent-up consumer demand to simply go out of your home, that people are looking forward to the opportunity as some of the COVID restrictions come off. We would expect to see some continuing acceleration in the on-premise channel as we progress through the summer, recalling that the on-premise channel was a fraction of what it was last year versus the prior year. So, we think that's all are going to take good care of itself as the year goes on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Good morning, everyone. A question for Garth. Just wanted to follow-up on the commentary around inflation becoming more uncertain. So, just maybe if you can comment on two things related to that. What areas -- so what types of inputs are becoming more certain, is that freight, is it packaging, labor cost? Just trying to understand kind of where the potential pressure points could be? And then, if you could tie to that as well, if we step back today versus where we were at the beginning of the fiscal year, can you give us a sense of just how much flexibility has been eaten up by inflation coming higher? Or are you in the same place in terms of just flexibility to hit your profit growth goals this year? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yes. Thanks, Bryan. And just as a reminder, when we issued our Q4 guidance, we talked about inflation and we said that, overall, we are expecting inflation kind of in the low to mid-single-digit range. And that was taking into account that on any given line item within our cost structure we were seeing the inflation kind of the low-to-high single-digit range. We have -- as we talked about at that time, we have a pretty effective hedging policy in place and we entered the year in a good position as I said. So, as we look out this year, first of all, the outlook for inflation still kind of remains the same. Our outlook as well as sort of the external advice we get on this is still that inflation is going to have a bit of a spike but it's going to be temporary in nature. The question just is like how temporary, right? It seems as though that kind of blip, it might take a bit longer to kind of come down from there. And so, the things that we're watching mostly right now really are around as you indicated, logistics and transportation, and labor, and those things are somewhat intertwined if you will. The labor market has made it difficult to get dedicated trucking lines and so, that's becoming more and more competitive. So, that's absolutely a concern. We continue to watch aluminum and then we look at natural gas to -- or glass, right? Glass, because glass is impacted by natural gas. So, those are the areas we're kind of most watchful for as we go through the year. I said it, as we sit here today, we're feeling like we're in a similar position to be able to cover our inflationary headwinds as long as they don't get significantly worse as we go through the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta from Evercore. Your line is now open. Eric Serotta : Great, thank you. Bill, hoping to get a little bit more granularity as to what you're expecting from the Hard Seltzer category and the broader ABA category or the ABA category more broadly? And related to that, you reiterated that you're more than doubling Corona Seltzer's capacity this year and you'll have the additional 5 million hectoliters of ABA capacity at Nava I believe for next year. If your forecast on ABA growth don't pan out, how flexible is that capacity to produce traditional beer? William Newlands : So related to the Hard Seltzer capacity point, we're still expecting that the Hard Seltzer category is going to grow somewhere in the 30% to 50% range, somewhere in that range this year overall. And obviously, we did roughly 10 million cases last year with one SKU. We've introduced our second Variety Pack. We're very excited about that process so far and Limonada is just hitting the market really as we speak. I got to remind you again, what I said earlier, which is despite doubling the size of our ABA and Hard Seltzer capability for this year, the number one growth driver in our portfolio will remain Modelo, irrespective of that significant growth. So, we are very comfortable with our growth profile across the business. What I would say is, this is -- we do have significant flexibility around the capacity that we put in and how that can be used within the business. And many of the things like packaging and so forth, really serve as the entire business anyway. So, we do have a fair amount of flexibility depending on if there's any changes in any of the particular sub-segments of the beer category at any point in time. We've worked very hard to make sure there is flexibility within our production capacity capabilities so that we can adjust to any change in consumer demand. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Chris Carey : Hi, thank you. So, I actually have a question just about Wine & Spirits. Price mix has been a good story in the business, that's accelerated this quarter, obviously, margins got hit. I'm just trying to frame where you think we are on the path to the medium and longer-term margin targets here? We knew there was always going to be a step back before recovery and certainly, it seems like the price mix and premiumization of the portfolio can deliver what you think it can. But we also have a much more inflationary backdrop and things are evolving. So, I wonder if you can just maybe take a look at this quarter and how it informs how you're continuing to look at the capacity of this business to deliver those margin targets over time and perhaps the timeline on what you think that can happen? Garth Hankinson : Yes, Chris. Thanks for the question. So, as you indicated, the topline is doing quite well. So, we're very pleased with our transformation as it relates to top-line growth. In terms of the margins journey, what we've always said around that is, it was going to take us about two years post divestiture to get to the 30% operating margins. And in order to get to about 30% operating margin, it was going to take a number of different things. There was pricing, there is mix, there is the cost takeout that we've talked about previously, stranded cost takeout of around $130 million, not all of which will fall to the bottom line. Some of that, we will reinvest behind the brands to make sure that we have strong brands that can generate the topline growth, as well as other initiatives around footprint optimization as a result of that the Gallo divestiture, not only did we share a large number brands but we also shared seven wineries, seven facilities with that transaction. So, there is a footprint optimization, as well as doing some cost optimization to make sure that the products we're putting in the bottom-most reflect what the consumers are looking to get when they pick up those brands. So, that -- we're well underway. We certainly didn't sit back and wait for the transaction to close to identify those cost savings, those initiatives. So, we're just now executing against those. But as you say, we're at that interim period where the business is a bit deleveraged. And so, until the rest of those cost comes out, we -- you will see that kind of -- that downward blip as you noted this year as we move to the 30% operating margins at the end of sort of two years post divestiture. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Greg [ph] on the line for Kevin. Just one quick follow-up question on some of the on-premise channel trends that you guys have been seeing. Many of your peers have noted that it's been running in front of plan so far in terms of the number of reopenings, the velocity that they've seen. You guys gave some helpful context on what you've seen over the last quarter, but maybe could you talk about how your expectations for the full year have changed? Have you seen the reopening phase faster than you thought it would be? And maybe how you think that would impact full year results? Thank you. William Newlands : Sure. Let me take that one, Greg. The -- we have seen it accelerate tremendously. But as we've seen over the course of the last 18 months around the pandemic, you often see some things where you get starts and stops and things improve in certain states and don't improve in other states, and so on and so forth. I think the important thing from our perspective to look at is, while we've seen 250% growth in our depletions in the quarter versus prior year, the overall percentage of our business that the on-premise represents is still a bit less than it was in fiscal year wherein calendar -- excuse me, calendar year '19. So, we still think there's still some opportunity and acceleration to come. We also have had an exceptional -- and our distributor network does an exceptional job of winning the times that matter, things like 4th of July, Labor Day. We did it with Cinco de Mayo, we did it with Memorial Day. So, we still think there's going to be some good opportunities for acceleration. The challenge to predict how much of the channel shifting that occurred? There was a massive amount of channel shifting that occurred a year ago when you went heavily to the off-premise. You're now seeing the on-premise comes back on and the IRI and Nielsen data has been somewhat muted. So, we also have seen, as we noted in our scripts, a significant increase in our three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer across the business. So, how all those channels sort of shake out is a real question. I think the encouraging part remains. The consumer demand against our business across all channels that we can track has been extraordinarily strong and we're excited and we think that will continue irrespective of which channel the consumer chooses to engage in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to just follow on this one, this last commentary Bill on where consumers are engaging. And it seems like, as you said -- you just said now that it's still below the calendar '19 level. So, can you comment a little bit of how you see that transition? Like your consumers are still engaging at home and the consumption of your -- obviously, your big brands is still very stronger at home despite the shift and how you're seeing that? And then, just a clarification on also on the inventory and shipments. Is it fair to say that given that you have a very easy comp on the production in April, right? So, going to have a lot of like inventory that you haven't built yet, but is still on transit from Mexico. Is that something that gives you some comp for that? Even though you said you only see the normalization by the third quarter, that the second quarter is still going to be a very strong shipment quarter. William Newlands : Sure. So, let's start with question around the on-premise. Keep in mind, based on what we can see, per capita consumption has remained pretty steady throughout the pandemic. It's just that where and how people consume has moved around quite a bit. So, it's really difficult to precisely predict how consumers are going to operate. And I think it's going to vary, as I said a moment ago, quite a bit by state depending on the individual restrictions and whether or not certain states are still allowing takeaway from a restaurant environment for alcoholic beverages, some are not. So, until all this dynamic plays itself out, I think it's going to be very difficult to predict exactly how the consumer will land. Other than I would say some of the sheer shopping behavior where you see three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer changes are going to continue. As we've said in prior calls, we have made major investments to increase our capability in three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, and I'm very glad that we did. It's playing out well and it's showing tremendous takeaway in those sectors which have grown around the pandemic. As it relates to inventory, we continue to believe we're going to have a very solid year. We're in a good position to make up the challenge that was the one-time challenge around the power outage that occurred in February, and we expect to have, as we've said, a very strong year and that I would expect would include the second quarter which is upon us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Powers : Hey, guys. Thank you very much. I know you've got a lot of questions already, Bill, but just to round out that last topic on beer supply. I guess is there a ceiling we should think about in terms of how much you're just physically able to ship in 2Q? I think consensus has you shipping around 100 million cases in the second quarter relative to the 85 million in the first quarter. And I guess just given all that you said, I'm just trying to understand or dimension whether that kind of step up is doable in broad brushstrokes or in the back half? And then, I -- what I really wanted to ask about was for Garth, just -- you ran through a number of items, very helpfully that will kind of weigh -- explain the beer margin trajectory sequentially and what will weigh on beer margins over the remainder of the year. If you could provide any more detail there, may be a rank order just in terms of the items we should be focusing on is having the biggest impact there, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Thank you to both. William Newlands : Yes, you bet. So, let me start with the first half, and then Garth will cover the second half. The one thing that we haven't mentioned today, but it's an important one is -- but we did mention it in prior quarters. Our Obregon, opening of the extension of Obregon was delayed roughly a quarter last year -- at the end of last year, because we weren't able to construct during COVID. So, that is certainly going to help our inventory position as we move forward as that's now up and running. It's not running as efficiently as it will once we get everything locked and loaded because it's just a normal startup. But it's certainly helping the situation and we certainly expect to be able to meet consumer demand during our key summer selling season as I said earlier. We're being -- we're working very carefully with our distributor network and our retail partners to make sure that we are able to meet the demand. Admittedly, the demand has been robust and continues to be very strong, but we are expecting to be able to meet that demand, and certainly, Obregon is a big helper in that area. Garth, you want to take that out? Garth Hankinson : Yes. Just to follow-up on the margin question. So, as we stated in Q4, really, it's those three big drivers of depreciation, inflation, and mix, and those are really kind of equally weighted in terms of the impact on margins. So, on the depreciation front, that was -- we have an increase of about $65 million this year, and that's comprised of Obregon full year [indiscernible] in the glass joint venture [ph], depreciation as well as some other things. Inflation, I think we've covered, and the fact that it's more in the second half of the year as our hedges kind of roll-off. And then mix, I think mix is also something that's going to impact us again more as we go through the year because we started the year really with kind of one SKU in Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #1, Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2 was just launched at the beginning, and then we launched Limonada here in June. So, there will be a more mix impact as we go through the balance of the year as well. But really it's equally -- the impact is equal across those three buckets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : Thank you. And hi, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in the queue. Up to recently [indiscernible] penetrate most from these spending household about 15% for the right kinds were to a record as a test was not pleasing [indiscernible]. So, now with new bolder flavors, Seltzer and brown/black [ph] targeting specifically Hispanic, we are seeing household penetration within Hispanic going up to 25 to 35. So, my question is do you see that as a risk to your portfolio of Mexican beer? And if not, why? And what are you doing to reach more Hispanic consumer with your current Seltzer portfolio? Thank you. William Newlands : Certainly. Well, as you know, we are very fortunate with our Mexican beer portfolio to have the strength of brands that we do. These are iconic, authentic brands from Mexico that our Hispanic community is very much behind. And we continue to see strength and growth. As I've said you, I think -- not to you, but I've said in prior calls, we continue to see opportunities with Modelo/ The household penetration with Modelo despite the rapid growth of Modelo is still not at the level of Corona as an example. We're also seeing over-development in the Hispanic community with our Corona Hard Seltzer. So, we are reaching into that community by again meeting new occasions and meeting new consumer needs with those particular products. So, we are very comfortable with the growth profile that we see in the Hispanic community with our iconic portfolio from Mexico and we think the Seltzer element is going to be an important and hopeful part of continuing the relationship with the Hispanic community, recognizing that we're also doing a great job of expanding those brands into the non-Hispanic community as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Stirling from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Trevor Stirling : Hi, good afternoon, Garth, and Bill. Two quick questions from my side, please. As you sit today and you compare with three months ago, have anything changed to change your point of view either for F22 or the outlook? I think the second thing related to that, given the cadence of inflation you talked about given the aluminum spot price staying as high as these and those hedges rolling off, historically, you've had that 1% to 2% pricing algorithm. Do you think that might need to change 12 months out? William Newlands : I'll take the price part, Garth. Maybe you take the first part. Relative to the price, we continue to believe 1% to 2% is going to be our long-term expectation. We think that balances appropriately the dynamics that occur with price sensitivity when you raise your price and recognizing, it does obviously help you cover any inflationary effects during the course of the year. So, we're pretty comfortable, that algorithm of 1% to 2% is the right answer, that balances all of those factors and we would see that continuing well into the future. Garth Hankinson : Yes, in terms of the first part of that question, the Q1 changed our point of view for the full year. I would say that at this time, it's too early for us to make any changes to our outlook for the year given one-quarter end. The one thing that I would highlight, right, as Bill noted in his script, depletions in our beer business exceeded our expectations as well as the expectations of our distributor, our retail partners. So, that's something that we'll watch very, very closely as we move through Q2 and through the balance of the year. And look, when -- as we go through the year and we do see changes to our business, we'll be sure to update you all on our guidance expectations. But as of right now, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we provided and reaffirm today with a bit of a tick-up on our EPS related to the share repurchase program. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. William Newlands : Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. I think it should be clear, the fiscal '22 is off to a strong start, providing us with continued momentum as we head into our key summer selling season. Our powerful collection of consumer connected brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain traction and we are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. Our robust cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and we look forward to updating everyone throughout the fiscal year, as we expect to make continued progress during fiscal '22. In closing, I'd like to wish all of you a happy 4th of July and hope that your celebrations with family and friends include our fantastic beer, wine and spirit products. Thank you, again, everyone and have a good summer. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Josh and good morning and welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill. William Newlands : Thank you Patty. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2 and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However, the fundamentals of our business remains solid and consumer demand for our brands particularly our core beer portfolio remains strong. This gives us confidence to increase our EPS guidance for the year which we outlined in our press release earlier today and Garth will review in more detail shortly. In addition, we repurchased a significant number of shares in Q2 at prices that are favorable as we believe Constellation\u2019s stock is undervalued at current levels. We've received some feedback from investors on this topic in recent weeks and we will address key themes that emerge from these discussions in our remarks.  As we walk through our Q2 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year there are several key takeaways we would ask you to keep in mind. Number one, the momentum of our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers as we are the leading share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer market. The majority of our growth continues to be driven by Modelo Especial supported by strong consumer demand for Corona Extra and Pacifico and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that Modelo Especial in particular has a long runway for growth given the steadily increasing household penetration for this brand among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity.  Now we've admittedly had some supply challenges this fiscal year driven by several external factors, the most relevant being the ongoing robust demand for our beer brands. We do expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4. Despite these challenges we continue to be on track to deliver a better than expected year for our beer business. In fact, our strong performance today gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9% to 11% net sales growth and 4% to 6% operating income growth for fiscal 2022. Our view is reinforced by recent 12 week IRI trends showing the Constellation\u2019s beer business is significantly outpacing the high end and total U.S. beer industry.  Point two, as it relates to our Hard Seltzer business and building off our last point, we are unique in our position versus our competitors in this space as our primary growth is coming from our core beer portfolio and we're not reliant on the growth of Hard Seltzer and ABA\u2019s to achieve the medium term growth goals for our beer business. The Hard Seltzer landscape has shifted considerably in recent months therefore we've lowered our growth expectations for Corona Hard Seltzer resulting in a sizeable obsolescence charge taken for Q2 which includes our view of the total impact for the fiscal year. But let's be clear, we continue to see the Hard Seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector in the beer market and we continue to believe it's important to participate in and gain our fair share in this segment to complement the growth of our core imported beer portfolio and to maintain our position as a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. Going forward we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers. I'll have more to say on this topic in a moment.  Number three, while our wine and spirits business was challenged in the quarter by underperformance of several mainstream brands due to tough COVID comparisons, our recent route to market transition and supply chain challenges for our imported wine brands we continue to see the benefits of our premiumization strategy take hold. We are performing well in the high-end of the wine segment which represents the vast majority of expected industry growth over the next several years and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC. Number four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, strategic, disciplined, and consumer led approach with a focus on high growth segments aligned with consumer trends. Our innovation agenda is designed to complement our organic growth and we're developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business while further premiumizing our portfolio into margin accretive price points. Over the years we've been able to extend some of our brands into new spaces recruiting new drinkers and expanding occasions and we've achieved a healthy balance between both from the core and from innovation.  Number five, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged since I assumed the role of CEO almost three years ago. Since then we've made significant progress in reducing debt and achieving our goal of returning 5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2023 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In fact, to date this fiscal year we have repurchased 1.4 billion of our shares and when combined with our dividend we have achieved nearly 60% of our 5 billion goal. To be clear, our shareholder value equation is based on outsized growth combined with return of dollars to shareholders. One of the most important capital allocation priorities is to continue reinvesting in our beer business to keep up with robust demand for our products. Despite initial challenges associated with the build out of a third brewery in Mexico, we have moved on to other capacity alternatives in the country. Our expansions in Nava and Obregon helped ensure we have adequate production capacity for the medium-term and will create much needed redundant capacity that better enables us to manage through unexpected events like we've experienced these past two years. We continue to work with the Mexican government to solidify plans for a new brewery in Southeastern Mexico with adequate water supply and an available talented workforce.  Now let's move on to a more fulsome discussion about our performance within the quarter. During the quarter the McDowell brand family posted depletion growth of 17% for the quarter and single handedly drove total import share gains in the IRI channels on a dollar basis. As the number two beer brand in dollar sales in the entire U.S. beer category, Modelo Especial is the only major beer brand growing household penetration and is leading the way as the number one share gainer among high end brands. Modelo Chelada has become the number two brand family in the Chelada space posting depletion growth of more than 50% for the second quarter. Corona Extra continues its growth trajectory as the second best to share gainer and the number one loved brand in the import category driven by a return to growth in the on premise which currently represents approximately 11% of our beer business brand.  In addition to the comments I made earlier about our Hard Seltzers I'd like to discuss industry trends and our refreshed approach to this sector of the beer market going forward. In the short to medium term we believe that there will be consolidation within the Hard Seltzer/ABA space primarily due to the chaos of skew and brand proliferation with too many new entrants that don't have the velocity or consumer demand to warrant shelf space. We also believe this sub category will evolve beyond low calorie, low carb offerings and open up to more distinctive consumer value propositions that include things like more flavor, different alcohol bases, and functional benefits. We've already started to innovate in this way with distinct products like Refresca and Limonada. We've also discovered that consumers are looking for more robust taste and flavor in their Seltzers. As a result, we will be altering the flavor and taste profile of our Seltzer portfolio to better align with the changing consumer preferences while also introducing single serve packages to better serve the growing convenience channel, our largest trade channel. And we have a solid line up of innovation that we have yet to introduce.  We have several great examples of our innovation strategy at work within our wine and spirits portfolio. This business continues to drive growth from recently launched innovations including Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, the Prisoner Cabernet and Chardonnay all of which are amongst the top 10 innovations across high-end wine in IRI channels during the quarter. And our wine and spirits innovation pipeline is ready to go with further consumer led new products as we head into our peak selling period including the expansion of our Svedka Ready to Drink platform and the introduction of Woodbridge Wine Seltzer\u2019s and boxed wines.  In addition to driving growth through innovation we're making progress with our core wine and spirits portfolio despite the previously mentioned challenges. We continue to take pride to further premiumize our mainstream portfolio as these steps are critical to maintain brand equity and to improve profitability which will serve our brands well over the long-term. We're putting points on the board in a number of areas where we're outperforming the U.S. wine market. Our high-end super premium plus portfolio grew net sales double-digits during the quarter. In on premise channels our investments are paying off with enhanced wine offerings at major restaurant chains. We're thriving in critical emerging channels like three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer which continued to drive high-end growth where we are outpacing category performance at key accounts such as Instacart, Amazon, and Albertsons with the resurgence of online shopping due to the COVID pandemic. For example, Constellation\u2019s fine wine share has expanded significantly in the latest 12 weeks due to the robust growth of the Prisoner on Instacart and Robert Mondavi Winery online.com. In fact, e-commerce and DTC sales are up nearly three to four times versus 2019 and they comprise roughly 3% to 5% of our business versus 1% pre-pandemic. Going forward we will continue to focus on becoming a category leader in e-commerce and DTC as we believe these channels will make up a significant portion of our mix over time and will continue to be an opportunity for high-end growth.  I would also like to provide you an update on our U.S. harvest which is about 70% complete at this point well while our production facilities, wineries, and tasting rooms remain untouched by recent wildfire activity. This quarter our ventures activities included investments in adaptogen infused Hop Wtr and Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's artisanal Dos Hombres mezcal. Hop Wtr is a non-alcoholic calorie free sparkling water infused with adaptogens and nootropics to provide the perfect balance of function and flavor for health conscious consumers. The non-alcoholic segment of total beverage alcohol grew almost 40% in 2020 in dollar sales through IRI channels and according to IWSR research 60% of consumers are switching between non-alcoholic or low-alcoholic and full strength drinks within the same occasion. Dos Hombres is an award winning hand crafted mezcal brand created by breaking bad co-stars who have developed an exceptional liquid that receives frequent praise from both the industry and consumers. The overall U.S. mescal category grew 14% in 2020 according to IWSR and super premium mezcal priced above $30 per bottle is projected to be the largest and fastest growing segment within the category. Moving on to Canopy growth. We're encouraged by the recent introduction of the cannabis opportunity in Administration Act draft bill which was introduced by Senators Booker, Wyden, and Schumer in July. More than 90% of Americans are in favor of cannabis legislation for medical purposes and two thirds of those are in favor of legalizing for recreational use as well. In fact, nearly two out of three Americans already have legal cannabis access as 37 states have legalized for medical use and 18 states for adult use. While we're optimistic about Federal Legislation within this Congress, Canopy is now waiting for this reality to materialize. Canopy\u2019s U.S. business grew 91% year-over-year in the most recent quarter driven by robust consumer demand for their CBD and CBG products including Martha Stewart branded products, quarto  beverages, storage and baked  products, and BioSteel's new RTDs. Over the coming years revenue for Canopy\u2019s U.S. business is expected to grow significantly as it benefits from increasing distribution and new product introductions. Once THC permissibility becomes a reality in the U.S. Canopy expects their U.S. business to make a substantially greater contribution to their results. Canopy has scaled in multi-state route to market plan ready for legalization and has leveraged Constellation's distributor relationships to fuel their U.S. non-PHD business with more opportunities in a world post Federal permissibility. Overall we're comfortable with Canopy\u2019s progress and we're looking forward to the growth and legalization prospects for the business. In closing I'd like to reiterate our main takeaways for this quarter. First, continued strong demand for our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers led by their number one share gainer in the beer category Modelo Especial which we feel has ample runway for growth well into the future given the steadily increasing household penetration rates among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. The short-term supply disruption to our imported beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects as we expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4 and we're on track to deliver a better than expected year for our beer business.  Second, we continue to see the Hard Seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector within the beer market. Going forward we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we can offer meaningful points of differentiation in unique value to consumers and we have some upcoming innovation in this space that we're optimistic about. Number three, we continue to see benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy take hold. We are performing well in the higher-end of the wine segment and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC. Four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, disciplined, and consumer led approach focused on high growth segments aligned with consumer trends to complement our organic growth while developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business at margin accretive price points. And fifth and certainly not least, our shareholder value equation continues to be based on the outsized growth combined with the return of dollars to shareholders and let me reiterate our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged.  We remain committed to our goal of returning 5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2023 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong operational performance and cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in Q2 aligned with our commitment which contributed to the increase in our EPS guidance for the year. At the same time, we remain committed to continuing to reinvest in our business with an emphasis on our beer business to keep up with the robust demand for our products. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth. Garth Hankinson : Thank you Bill and hello everyone. Q2 certainly reflected another strong quarter of marketplace performance for our beer business. Due to continued robust consumer demand for core beer portfolio we now expect to exceed our initial top line and operating income targets for our beer business. Additionally, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter and through September we've repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.4 billion. As a result, we have increased our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target and we now expect to be in the range of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity and earnings impact and reflects the increase in beer operating income guidance and decrease in the average -- in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding based on shares repurchased through September partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2022. Now let's review future performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of nearly 12% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on premise channel. Depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 driven by out of stocks due to ongoing robust consumer demand as well lost shipping days for some of our distributors due to severe weather events including hurricanes and wildfires. We estimate that these factors hampered Q2 growth by approximately two to three points. As Bill mentioned on premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 6% of our depletion volume in Q2 fiscal 2021 as a result of the on premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will also be flat in Q3. Wholesaler depletions continued to outpace cases shipped during Q2 resulting in a lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. To rectify this gap, shipment case volume is expected to exceed depletion case volume throughout the second half of the fiscal year resulting in a gradual improvement of distributor inventories during Q3 and Q4 as inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year. Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin decreased 530 basis points versus the prior year to 37.2%. Benefits from favorable pricing, mix, and foreign currency were more than offset by unfavorable COGS, increased marketing investments, and higher SG&A. The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that include the following. First, a Q2 obsolescence charge of $66 million. As a result of our production constraints earlier in the year we pre-built Hard Seltzer inventory in advance of the key summer selling season based on our best estimates for fiscal year 2022. Due to the overall slowdown in the Hard Seltzer category in the U.S. some of that growth is not going to materialize in the fiscal year resulting in excess inventory. Second, increased brewery cost driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased headcount, and incremental spend related to capacity expansion. Third, a step up in depreciation expense largely due to incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon. And finally, as expected increased material costs predominately driven by increased commodity prices and inflationary headwinds on pallets, cartons, and aluminum. These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption.  Marketing a percent of net sales increased 150 basis points to 9.9 versus prior year as we return to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19 related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Lastly, the increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $12 million in legal expenses as well as higher compensation and benefits. As mentioned earlier, we are increasing full year fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income guidance for our beer business. We are now targeting net sales growth of 9% to 11% reflecting the strength of our core beer portfolio and pricing actions that are higher than initially planned. Furthermore, we are now targeting operating income growth of 4% to 6% which implies operating margin in the low to mid-point of our stated 39% to 40% range. Please note that the updated guidance includes all obsolescence charges and legal expenses incurred in the first half of the fiscal year.  We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by several cost headwinds. However, the mix and magnitude of these headwinds have changed from our original assumptions presented at the beginning of our fiscal year. First, we're still estimating a significant step up in depreciation expense which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started late which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started later in the year versus plan. As such we are now estimating total beer depreciation expense to approximate $250 million, an increase of approximately $55 million versus last year or a $10 million decrease versus our original planned estimate. Second, we still expect substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components to continue during the second half of our fiscal year as commodity prices continue to rise specifically across aluminum, diesel, and pallets resulting from a rather volatile inflationary market. And third, due to the growth moderation within the Hard Seltzer market as well as lower ACB levels across the category on new items, we do not expect our Hard Seltzer skews to meet our originally planned volume expectations which results in a positive mix benefit versus our original estimate. Conversely due to the slowdown in the Hard Seltzer sector excess inventory resulted in a fiscal year-to-date obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million. Please note that these losses cover our Hard Seltzer obsolescence exposure and as such we do not expect to take any additional obsolete charges in the back half of the fiscal year for Hard Seltzers. From a marketing perspective we continue to expect full year spend as a percentage of net sales planned in the 9% to 10% range which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. Looking ahead to Q3 I'd like to remind everyone of the difficult buying overlaps we will encounter as we're facing a 28% and 12% growth comparison for shipment volume and depletion volume respectively. Additionally, we expect to reform our normal annual brewery maintenance during Q3 which will result in a less throughput versus Q2 as we have to shut down production for a few days. As such we are estimating low single digit shipment volume growth for Q3.  Moving to wine experience, Q2 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 18% on shipment volume down to 36%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 15% driven by organic shipment volume growth of nearly 6%, favorable mix and price, and smoke tainted bulk wine sales. Robust mix driven by the Prisoner brand family Meiomi and Kim Crawford accounted for approximately nine points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth. Shipments were negatively impacted by port delays for our international brands and route to market changes which also impacted depletions. Depletion volume declined 2% during the quarter and was additionally impacted by the challenging overlap in consumer pantry loading behavior especially for our mainstream brands that experienced robust growth during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year we feel as though most of these challenges are behind us and expect shipment volume and depletion volume to generally align in the second half of fiscal 2022.  Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 620 basis points to 19.7% as mixed benefits from the existing portfolio and divestitures combined with favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend, higher COGS, and margin dilutive smoke tainted bulk wine sales. Higher COGS were driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and increased transportation costs. The unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulted from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a frost during our harvest season earlier this year as well as decreased production levels at our wineries in California due to the 2020 U.S. wildfires. These headwinds were partially offset by lower grade raw materials and other cost savings initiatives. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower SG&A spend in Q2 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging impacting operating margins.  For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24% which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. From a Q3 perspective keep in mind that we are lapping unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million in the prior year resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. We expect this favorable overlap to be partially offset by a continued increase in transportation costs and incremental unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the New Zealand frost. Also, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result of the wine and spirits divestitures. As such we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q3 fiscal 2022.  Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in approximately $170 million up 7% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation benefits, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $245 million driven by increase in compensation and benefits. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% to approximately 96 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We now expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. This slight decrease versus our previous guidance reflects early redemption of higher interest rate debt as well as $1 billion of senior notes issued in July at attractive rates.  Our Q2 comparable basis affected tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 21.8% versus 16.9% in Q2 of last year primarily driven by the timing of stock based compensation benefits and higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 19%. This increase is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate on our core earnings than originally estimated. I would also note that we expect stock based compensation tax benefits to be weighted towards Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year estimate at approximate 21%. We also now expect our 2022 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 192 million reflecting an impact of our September year-to-date share purchases previously discussed.  Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CAPEX, we generated free cash flow of 1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2022 which is flat to prior year reflecting strong operating cash flows offset by an increase in CAPEX. CAPEX totaled $353 million which included approximately $295 million of beer CAPEX primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CAPEX guidance of 1 billion to 1.1 billion which includes approximately 900 million targeted for Mexican beer operation expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, this reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CAPEX spend previously outlined.  In closing I want to iterate that while we had our fair share of challenges during the first half of our fiscal year resulting in several puts and takes impacting our results, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and consumer demand for our products particularly our imported beer portfolio remains robust providing us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. And with that Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : . Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys, so on the beer topline front, first just a detailed question given the volatility here and the tough comp in Q3, can you give us an update on how September depletions are trending so far and also for the quarter are you expecting depletions to still be above that low single-digit shipment rate that you mentioned or is that tough with the difficult 12% depletion comp? And then second, the longer term question is, you raised your revenue guidance for this year how much of that is underlying demand strength and depletions maybe versus shipments and perhaps getting more supply into the balance of the year versus pricing and on the pricing front you've sounded more aggressive in terms of pricing expectations going forward publicly, a) I guess, is that correct and b) is that more just to combat higher commodity costs or is it more confidence in market share gains or that the consumer environment is conducive to taking pricing care? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure, Dara. Let me take a swing at that and if I miss anything Garth can fill in behind. So relative to depletes in September, we expect those to be fairly consistent with year-to-date trends. We're just about wrapped up for September. Keeping in mind that's going against the 20% increase that we had during September of last year. So, that's a pretty powerful start to the quarter. We do expect that depletions are going to continue to be above shipments for the reasons that Garth noted in his remarks. So we would expect that depletions would be above it for that window of time. The pricing environment remains relatively strong. As we've said, we expect to be slightly ahead of our usual algorithm driven more by taking to pricing on some skews that we had not anticipated earlier in the year, more than we're doing anything unique to take additional pricing where we -- over what we had already planned. Garth anything you want to add to that? Garth Hankinson : No, I will just say on the depletions for the quarter, depletion growth will absolutely outpace shipment growth in the quarter. But on an absolute basis, the shipments will outpace depletions which helps us get into a better position from an inventory perspective. William Newlands : Yes, keep in mind, as we've said, we have our inventory levels at our distributors below what we would like to see and what they would like to see on an ongoing basis. So we would be expecting to fill some of that as we get our inventory levels back to normal position by the end of the fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, thank you. I actually had a question on your guidance as well. I just -- in thinking through it and thinking about the mid points of your new beer guidance for the full year, this does imply a pretty big step down in the second half. For instance, your new guidance implies around 4% to 4.5% beer shipment volume growth, 3% off income growth, and then beer margins of 39% for the second half, and that compares to your beer margins of 40% in the first half, which did include the $80 million obsolescence charge that you pulled out. So, I guess, I'm trying to understand your level of conservatism with your new FY guidance especially with margins given you mentioned there's going to be no more charges in the second half. You highlighted you plan to take in incremental pricing and then there are a few other net positives Garth that you called out. So just wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything or maybe what\u2019s changed there? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Thanks, Bonnie. I mean look let me try to give you the walk on margins right and you noticed -- as you noted, we've got some headwinds and we've got some tailwinds, right. And so just on the tailwinds, obviously, we said in my opening remarks we've got a bit of a benefit on depreciation just starting later than expected in the year and so that's a net positive. As Bill just articulated, we're taking more -- we're taking increased pricing across more skews than we had originally planned, so we'll be above our range there. So that's a net positive. We also have a mix benefit of Seltzers and again a net positive there and then the increase in core beer outlook is a net positive. So, those are all the headwinds. But we still have -- those are all the tailwinds. But we still have the headwinds that we've been talking about all year long, right. So, even though depreciation is coming in less than expected, we still have an uptick in depreciation in the second half of the year. We still are facing increase in commodity prices, including aluminum, diesel, natural gas, wood those will continue in the second half of the year. Now we think that the guidance we provided takes into account all of those cost increases, so we feel we have those covered. But again, I mean, we just continue to have these puts and takes and we feel confident that in the margin outlook that we provided. Keep in mind too that even though we're going to have a mix benefit from Seltzers, we still are going to sell Seltzers and those are margin dilutive as we've noted previously. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I have two questions. One is a real quick one, just on the self-service formulation, still a bit -- I know you probably don't want provide too many details until it is in the market, but will this change the calorie or the sugar levels, so just curious on that? And then my broader question is Modelo is clearly doing very well. We see that in the data with non-Hispanic consumers. But as we look at some of the numerator data and we look at different cohorts, what we notice is that Corona has kind of leveraged to some of these demographics, so Modelo is doing much better so we are seeing some of those numbers in period. So just wanted to get a sense on incrementality of Modelo when you think about Modelo and Corona together and do you ever think that maybe there's a different merchandising scheme you can use instead of putting both brands right next to one another to kind of reduce some of that cannibalization? William Newlands : Sure. So relative to your first quick point there won't be radical change in the core formulation of our Seltzer layout. Relative to Modelo and Corona, obviously, there's interaction between those two brands as you would expect. However, as we've said before, Nik, and I'm sure you're quite familiar our household penetration on Modelo is still significantly below where Corona is to say nothing of it is below other brands that it competes against. So while it is a true statement that as Modelo grows or as Corona grows it does eat into some of our brands, we still see it as largely positive as we see that growth profile. And as we have talked before, Modelo, it continues to grow velocity, there's a lot -- still a lot of runway to expand distribution. Household penetration which I touched on just a second ago, remains a massive opportunity for that. And we only started advertising to the non-Hispanic community about three and half years ago. So, we're really just getting started on Modelo and the opportunity that presents itself there. So, well you continue to see some interaction and clearly, I think, the idea of separating those at retail to some degree has some opportunity. I think overall, we're still focused on expanding our presence of both of those brands. As you probably saw Corona Extra had a very good quarter. And it just shows the ongoing strength of the core Corona franchise in addition to exceptional performance by Modelo. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. I wanted to know a little bit about Corona Extra since you called out the 5% depletion growth for that brand and how that kind of shakes out between on premise recovery versus track channels or sorry, I should say I'm off premise? And then I was hoping you could also talk a little bit at Nielsen /IRI versus what you guys saw in terms of off premise trends in total, including on track outlets? And then finally, do any kind of update on Pacifico, just continually intrigued to hear about progress you are making with that brand? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. So probably 50% give or take of the growth profile that we saw in Corona Extra is the reopening of the on premise. As we said in prior calls, we were down as low as 3% of our business a few quarters ago during the sort of the peak of the initial COVID pandemic issue. That's now up to 11% and clearly with the Corona being one of the most loved brands that exist in the category, the increase that you would expect to see an on premise has been important. But don't underestimate, Corona actually has done very well at retail as well. Relative to Pacifico, we continue to feel like Pacifico is another great opportunity. It's like a baby Modelo. It's developing in a very similar way to what Modelo did say 20 years ago with extensive growth profile on the West Coast and it is starting to filter East. As you know, we're investing more against Pacifico than we have historically. We have a little bit of challenge in this quarter with Brown Glass, which had some impact on Pacifico during the quarter as it did with Modelo Negra as well. But those are ongoing supply chain challenges that we're working our way through. It does nothing, nothing to slow down what we expect to be another superb brand for us as time goes forward in Pacifico. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi, thank you very much. Just on Hard Seltzers. You had originally planned on investing pretty significantly behind the launch this year. Are you getting any savings from those investment plans now that the category has slowed or are those locked and presumably that can be a good story going into fiscal 2023? In addition, you had mentioned that you had plans to double capacity for your ABA\u2019s and so how are you thinking about flexing that capacity towards beer, obviously you're looking at building a new brewery in Southeast Mexico, does this get to delay that new build out over time because you have capacity? Garth Hankinson : Yes, yes, thanks for the question. So on the capacity piece first, right as we announced last spring, we were investing in 5 million hectoliters worth of ABA capacity that is moving forward as planned and should come online earlier in our fiscal year 2023. That's still an important initiative for us because it's built outlined in his prepared remarks. Well the Seltzer category has slowed the ABA segment within beer continues to be a dynamic and meaningful part of the high end and it's one that we need to need to compete in. And by having dedicated ABA capacity that frees up capacity for our core Mexican beer portfolio. So that goes on as planned. And then furthermore on the investment that you referenced in the first part your comment and your question, we did indicate that we going to spend $60 million this fiscal year behind Corona Hard Seltzer. Most of that spend was slated to be spent in the first half of the year. So that has been spent and that, which wasn't spent is being redirected to invest behind our core Mexican beer portfolio. William Newlands : The only other thing I'd add to that on the last part of your question was about whether or not it causes any delay in what we would do to invest in the Southeast. As I said, we're continuing to work with the Mexican government. We feel the Southeast is highly likely to be where we put our next brewery position. And as we said, because of robust demand we're going to continue to invest to support our business. So, we would not expect to see any radical change of what our timeframe is all about. Demand has been higher than expected. We need to create some redundancy in our system as we've noted on prior calls and our brewer in the Southeast will be an integral part of that strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. You may proceed with your questions. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could comment please on intra quarter trends in on premise, whether you saw an evolution or a softening there around the delta variant? And as well, perhaps from an industry perspective, are you observing any changes in consumer alcohol preference across kind of TBA, and across category switching as consumers central back out and deposit in restaurants? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. We saw a lot of variation in on premise and at the risk of saying yes, no, yes, no, and yes no it is largely depended on where you were geographically and what was going on in particular markets. So, while we would sit here and say, State X is coming up and we're seeing more on premise if you saw a wave of COVID challenges and in another market, you saw stuff go the other way. So what that basically I think there was an over overarching answer to that question, it was really on a localized basis that you saw many of the movements within the quarter. Again, in the aggregate, on premise was better than it was in the prior year and it continues to be increasing as a percentage of our business but it's still not quite where it was before the pandemic. So, hopefully that helps. It's very hard to give a real aggregate of the thing because it's really made up of a lot of individual answers rather than something being an overarching trend across the marketplace. I think relative to your question about across category, I think the overarching thing that you see there is the premiumization trends continue, whether you think about it in ready to drinks or ABA\u2019s, you continue to see people premiumizing, you see it in the wine business where the higher end of the wine business continues to outperform the mainstream sector of the business and you continue to see that in spirit. So, I think that is an over overarching trend, that you see. You also see what we found for many years now, which is consumers are more interested in having and array of beverages depending on the exact occasion in which they are consuming product and are less likely than they used to be to consume only one type of product at any anyone occasion than what was perhaps the case historically. So hope that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. Bill, just picking up on the last question, but really kind of lasering in I guess a little bit on wine and broadly for the industry, because there's been some discussion in the marketplace about the recent slowdown and it's not limited to the on premise and we have seen the Nielsen data. So your point is extremely well taken, the premiumization trends are still in place, obviously broadly based across total beverage alcohol but even on a two-year average basis this is -- we're seeing the trend slowdown here. So, I'm not sure how much more you can add to your comment previously. Do you view this as transient at this point on this deceleration we're seeing in the category, is there a bigger maybe bit more difficult to quantify dynamic going on around ready to drink beverages in a way there hasn't been with wine before, if you could comment on that? And Garth just sort of a cleanup up, but I think important, the 30% operating margin target in the wine segment, is that still the target and is fiscal 2024 over the next couple of years, is that sort of enough of a timeline line to take out the stranded overhead, so your comments there would be helpful? Thank you, both. William Newlands : I think you got to keep in mind relative to the higher end of the wine business, you're also seeing some what I'll call channel evolution and things like three tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. Those are for us three to four times what it was in 2019 and you're seeing that as sort of 3% to 5% of our business today where it was 1% before. So some of what you're seeing in that is a difference in the way the consumer actually acquires and it may or may not be reflective of some of the IRI/Nielsen data because it's not picked up in those channels. Some of it is with three tier e-commerce, but certainly the direct to consumer channel is not. So, you've got some of that dynamic in place and of course, almost all of that tends to the higher end. That's where that consumer purchasing behavior occurs. So, I do think there's ebbs and flows on all of those things. I think you saw probably more consumption behavior at home during COVID so you're probably seeing a little bit of more challenging comparable versus prior year. So, I think as we get hopefully back to a bit more normalcy, I think you'll continue to see what the long-term trend is which is that the higher end of the business continues to outperform, and then it's a strong growth of play for that sector. Garth. Garth Hankinson : Yeah. On the wine margins, certainly the target margin for wine is still 30%. As we've said all along that it was going to take us about two years post divestiture of the low end for us to be able to achieve that 30% operating margin. So, by the time we get to the end of our fiscal 2023 wine should be in that zip code. Obviously the progress on that is underway. We're making some good progress as we've said before in order to get there. There's a number of initiatives that that we have to make progress on, that's pricing mix footprint optimization, making smart design to value choices. And like I said, we're making good progress and we're confident that we can get that 30% by the end of 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. You may proceed with your question. Robert Ottenstein : Right. A couple of questions. First, obviously the low inventories hurt depletions. Can you give us a sense of where you think depletions would have been if you had full inventory levels and I'm hearing it hurt Corona most, can you verify that? William Newlands : Obviously, that's a little bit of a tough question to answer, because unlike a year ago where we were very selective a what we produced this year we've been producing all skews. We've just had trouble keeping up with the demand. Our best estimate would probably be in the 2 to 3 percentage points that we lost in this process. But again, in most instances the consumer is looking for our brand, they may have an issue out of particular point time finding a skew, but they don't have trouble finding our brand. So, I think that's probably the way to think about it. Robert Ottenstein : Great. And then second question, as you kind of do a diagnostic on what happened with Corona Seltzer, I think I heard you say that flavor was an issue, that the consumer wants more flavor. So, as you think about it, was it a question of the taste not being differentiated or is there an issue with having a brand that's associated with the beer or are there other factors in addition to obviously the sector slowing a little bit, just like to hear a little bit more of your diagnostic on the situation? William Newlands : Well, I would put more emphasis on your very last point, which is the sector changed a lot versus what everybody anticipated. I think we were probably a bit on the conservative event compared to some of the competition as to what they expected going into this year where some of them were predicting in excess of 50% growth, we projected less. But even as it was, we were wrong. So that is the fundamental issue. When you combine that with the fact that we pre-produced, which again at the time was about production scheduling and our judgment was the right thing to do at the time, that in hindsight did not work out for us as well either. But you got to keep in mind, despite all of that, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall growth profile. It is additive to our growth, it is not the majority of our growth. The majority of our growth continues to be the robust demand against our core beer portfolio, and that's where we expect it to continue to be. So, now relative to the formulation, we just -- we obviously do a lot of consumer research and we track consumer perspectives and we have found that consumers are desiring a bit more flavor and a bit more differentiation within their Seltzer preferences and we plan to address those consumer needs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Sean King : Great, thanks for the question. Thinking longer term on the margins front and some of the long-term exposures you have and hedges you have in place, is the second half fiscal 2022 the right way to be thinking about margins for 2023? William Newlands : Okay, I think the right way to think about margins over the near and medium term is consistent with our long-term growth algorithm, which is that we're going to achieve margins in the range of 39% to 40% and as we say in every call, those are best in class margins and we're not apologetic about those. In any given fiscal year margins might be slightly higher than that due to tailwinds and in some years they might be slightly lower than that just due to too many headwinds. But the right way over the medium term is to think about those in the range of 39% to 40%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question. Nadine Sarwat : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to circle back to Pacifico and you had called out the Brown Glass challenges that you faced. So obviously that brand saw weaker Nielsen off trade trends this quarter and I noticed that you didn't call out its depletion figures in the release. So, could you provide this and maybe give us some color as to if there were other issues outside of the glass issue you already called out? Thanks. William Newlands : Sure. We had mid-single-digit depletion growth in that brands during the quarter. And obviously it was constrained. We would have expected it to be higher without any supply chain issues that revolves around Brown Glass. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to the depletion in shipments commentary. You said depletion should outpace the low single-digit shipments you have guided in the 3Q which would imply a sequential acceleration in 3Q from the 12% on a two-year stack that you achieved in the second quarter. So given that you're facing a tougher comparisons, as you do depletion the same amount of our 12% in the third quarter of last year, is that acceleration on the two year coming mostly from on premise and at home decelerating, but still growing, is that the way we should be thinking, in other words, should we think about the depletion growing around mid-single-digits when you said, I think you said it emphatically that the third quarter depletions would outpace shipments as well? And then related to -- and just a clarification on the pricing front, should we think that you will have about 2% price mix realization already in 3Q and what are you seeing playing out so far? Thank you so much. William Newlands : Sir just on Q3 shipments and depletions. What we said in terms from a growth perspective, shipments will grow in the low single digits and depletions will grow higher than that. We furthermore said that on a volume basis, depletions -- shipments would outpace depletions and therefore we made progress in returning inventory to more normal levels by the end of our fiscal year. On the pricing question, what we said on that was is that our typical pricing algorithm has us gaining one to two percentage points per year. Given the pricing environment that we're in this year, we're able to be a little bit more aggressive on products that we wouldn't otherwise take pricing on. And so we're going to be -- we're going to take pricing on those skews and as a result, we will be slightly lump above our 2% this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. You may proceed with your question. Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. So, I'd like to come back on the Seltzer category. So first, what is the gross  for the category and really I am interested in the rationale behind it and thinking about the next let's a year or so? And then as you mentioned, there will be a consolidation with the elimination of lower velocity SKU, do you see a risk potentially for the Corona Seltzer, the white can as that SKU has been severely underperforming the category, so do you see a risk here that you could lose ACV? And finally, how are you planning to gain the fair share of the Seltzer category especially as Mexican brand I mean, Top Chico is really becoming more national beginning of next year and they are also launching a margarita flavored, more flavor than that SKU, so would like to understand how you will play that? William Newlands : Sure. If I understood the first part of your question correctly, I mean, keep in mind that the beer category has been roughly flat at a time when we are up roughly 8%. So there is a significant delta between what the overall category is performing and what we are performing. We're radically outperforming the category. Relative to our desire in the Seltzer/ABA space, there's a number of things. First of all, we're going to focus our attention on where we think we bring differentiated products that are distinct. Given what we have today, I would use Refresca and Limonada as two examples of that that meets specific needs and are not what I would describe as need to products. We also have as we noted in our scripts some innovation agenda items that we think are going to be distinctive and will bring unique value to the table as well. So, we continue to believe this is going to be additive portion of our growth, but certainly not the largest portion of our growth that will continue to be our core beer portfolio. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist. You may proceed to your question. Bill Chappell : Thank you. Sorry to belabor the Seltzer questions. But I mean I guess two things, one simple, one bigger picture. I mean, two quarters ago like you said, you have a lot of market research, you and everybody else was very bold up about the market and it seems like it was a soft summer. But it didn't seem like the category was a fad or it's over. But in kind of redirecting, marketing and advertising and moving to kind of focus SKUs, it seems that is what you're kind of saying so, I guess, is that what you're saying, I mean do you see this as kind of a small niche permanently and everybody was kind of wrong, it was going to be a bigger place or is this just a pause for the category? And then the second question is with you directing kind of advertising marketing towards your core beer portfolio, does that result in -- I know it's small, but Seltzer falling off a cliff over the next two quarters and creating kind of headwinds for your growth on beer? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Sure. Relative to the category, our view of it is this, we still think that the overall ABA space is going to be a growth category. Whether or not the Seltzer sub segment of the beer category is -- how much of that is going to be driven by the Seltzer sub segment remains to be seen. Quite frankly, clearly it is going to be a lot less than what everyone anticipated coming into this year. But again, for us, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall play. So, we are not entirely reliant on success in the Seltzer category. In fact, we expect to achieve our algorithm through our core beer business.  Relative to the question of will this put a damper on our growth in the beer business, if Seltzer is challenging, not really. I mean the fact that we are able to raise our guidance is largely driven by the fact that we're able to make more beer. And we're able to make more beer because we're making a little less Seltzer and that is margin accretive and it's a very high growth category. So I realize there is a bad side and good side to that answer. But the reality is, it's not inconsistent with what we've always seen, which is our core business portfolio of beer from Mexico continues to radically outperform the industry and we continue to be the leader in the high end and the high end growth. So, is it going to be any different going forward? I think it's a little bit remains to be seen. We're going to have a little bit more of a watch and see efforts than we had before. I think everyone got a little bit excited about Seltzer. And frankly, the category has slowed significantly. So I think we will probably do a much better job of being guarded in terms of our expectation around that while continuing to leverage our outstanding portfolio of core beer brands. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any closing remarks. William Newlands : Alright. Thanks very much. And thank you all for joining our call today. Despite some challenges impacting our results this quarter, as you can see, we remain very confident on the strength and underlying fundamentals of our business. Our beer business in particular continues to be a tight growth driver within the industry while we continue to see the benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization take hold. We remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, which provides us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January so we hopefully wish everyone a safe, happy, and holiday season. Please remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations, and please remain safe. Thanks for joining the call. Operator : Thank you. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. That concludes today's conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following prepared remarks, the call will be placed for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time.  I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I\u2019m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.  As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.  Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now, here\u2019s Bill. William Newlands : Thank you, Patty, and happy new year to everyone on the call. I sincerely hope you were able to enjoy a safe and happy holiday season with family and friends. Calendar year 2021 was another challenging year given the continued effects of the pandemic, a host of global supply chain issues impacting nearly every industry, inflationary pressures, and severe weather events. That said, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the determination shown by our team at Constellation throughout the year. They\u2019ve worked relentlessly, navigating a myriad of evolving dynamics to deliver a very solid performance year to date and in Q3, putting us on pace for another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal 2022. That said, I\u2019d like to highlight a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our Beer business delivered a very strong performance in Q3 while lapping tough comps in fiscal 2021. We continued to see robust consumer demand, yielding a high-single digit depletion growth. We extended our leadership position as the top share gainer in the high-end of the U.S beer market behind the strength of our Modelo and Corona Brand families while improving our inventory position. Our strong performance to date gives us confidence to increase top and bottom line guidance for our Beer Business in fiscal 2022. Second, we continue to see significant runway for growth for our core imported beer portfolio in the years ahead, and we\u2019re investing in the next increment of capacity additions required to sustain our momentum as this represents one of the most compelling value-creating opportunities for our company and our shareholders. Third, our Wine and Spirits business has made solid progress in transforming both its brand portfolio and financial profile. Q3 marked another step along our journey as we continue to shift to a higher-end wine and spirits business focused on delivering increased revenue growth and margin expansion. While our Wine and Spirits business continues to navigate through a series of headwinds impacting its year-to-date performance, our increased focus and investments behind our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio, margin accretion innovation, and e-commerce initiatives continued to gain traction and are enabling an increase in our net sales guidance for the business in fiscal 2022.  And finally, our strong overall total company performance in Q3 gives us confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Garth will provide additional details relative to our financial performance and fiscal year guidance in just a few minutes. Today, we are also excited about our announcement of a new agreement with the Coca-Cola Company in the United States to bring the Fresca brand into beverage alcohol through manufacturing and distributing a new line of Fresca Mixed Cocktails. Fresca is currently the fastest-growing diet soft drink in Coca-Cola\u2019s portfolio, and over half of Fresca consumers already use it as a mixer with spirits. Building on this great foundation and in alignment with emerging consumer preferences around convenience, flavor, and a preference for high-quality products, we plan to launch Fresca Mixed later this year starting with cocktails using real spirits and inspired by recipes created by Fresca fans from around the globe. With that, let\u2019s talk in more detail about our performance in the most recent quarter. Our Beer business posted depletion growth of more than 8% in the third quarter, outpacing the high-end of the U.S beer category. Modelo Especial continues to be our most significant growth driver, with depletions increasing over 13%. That is more than 5 million cases relative to the same quarter last year. It remains the brightest star in our portfolio as the top share gainer across the entire U.S beer category and IRI channels while maintaining its position as the number-one high-end beer brand. Our Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the number-one Chelada in the U.S beer market and maintained its explosive growth, posting 35% depletion growth in the third quarter. We continued to build on this extremely successful innovation platform with a new entrant, Modelo Chelada Pi\u00f1a Picante, which was launched in August and is already a top share gainer among imported brands. Corona Extra sustained its reinvigorated growth trajectory and positioned as the second-fastest import share gainer and the number-three high-end brand in IRI channels with 11% depletion growth versus prior year. Similarly, Corona Premier continued its strong performance with 8% depletion growth which accelerated through distribution gains as supply conditions improved. From an innovation perspective within the Corona Brand family, Refresca and Refresca Mas are back in production and contributing nicely to growth in our ABA portfolio. Meanwhile, Corona Hard Seltzer remains a top seltzer brand in IRI following the dramatic slowdown in the seltzer category. We\u2019re making good progress to enhance our flavor profiles and we\u2019re on track to roll out the restaging of our variety packs, Tropical Mix pack and Berry Mix pack in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. And we are diligently working to address the brown glass shortage that is acting as a headwind this year, especially for our Pacifico brand which continues to see strong demand and has a long runway for growth ahead. Overall, our outstanding performance gives us confidence to increase guidance for our Beer business as we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth in fiscal 2022.  To fuel the continued growth of our imported beer portfolio, we plan to deploy an increased level of investment over the next four fiscal years to support construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as to expand and optimize capacity at our existing Nava and Obregon operations. Garth will give you additional details on that momentarily. Now, moving on to our Wine and Spirits business, we remain committed to our vision to become a full and innovative high-end wine and spirits business with distinctive brands and products delivering exceptional consumer experiences.  In an effort to make this vision a reality, we recently reorganized into two distinct commercial teams within the business, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands, and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands; while each team has their own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to our goal of accelerating performance by increasing revenue growth and expanding margins. Our fine wine and craft spirits business is delivering solid growth this year driven by brands like The Prisoner Unshackled, Robert Mondavi winery, and High West as well as strong gains in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce, hospitality, and international businesses. Our mainstream and premium business is focused on maintaining share in the mainstream wine segment while delivering and continuing to deliver growth through premium segment brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, in line with our consumer-driven premiumization strategy.  While we\u2019ve experienced recent headwinds on mainstream brands like Woodbridge, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, and SVEDKA, IRI trends for these brands have improved since overlapping the peak of the pandemic supported by an increased focus on more relevant branding, strategic pricing, and innovation. Throughout our wine and spirits portfolio, we\u2019ve launched several innovations that are creating momentum and driving growth, including Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, both of which were among the top five share gainers in their respective price points in IRI channels this quarter. During the quarter, we also launched multiple initiatives. First, the Editor\u2019s Collection, an exciting collaboration between our Simi Winery and the Hello Sunshine Book Club, the Book Club community founded by media mogul and innovator, Reese Witherspoon. Second, SVEDKA\u2019s ready-to-drink vodka soda mix pack and third our new Woodbridge three-liter box; we\u2019ve also experienced successful market expansion for our Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection spirit barrel aged wines. Within our DTC portfolio, we\u2019ve launched exclusive SKUs for the Robert Mondavi Winery and The Prisoner Saldo red blends as well as High West Midwinter\u2019s Night\u2019s Dram and their ready-to-serve Manhattan and Old Fashion Cocktails.  Within the three-tier e-commerce landscape, Constellation continues to outpace total US wine market growth by double-digits. In fact, Meiomi sales in the three-tier e-commerce channels increased 27% versus the prior year. Currently, about 10% of Meiomi\u2019s sales come from three-tier e-commerce which is the highest level among leading U.S wine brands in IRI e-commerce channels. While we advanced our strategic agenda in wine and spirits, we continued to address a number of headwinds that have impacted our year-to-date performance. We continued to lap last year\u2019s COVID pantry-driven loading where we experienced outsized growth. However, upcoming comparable growth rates are less challenging.  Throughout the year, we\u2019ve experienced out-of-stocks and other operational challenges related to our SAP implementation, a difficult domestic and international logistics environment, and our route-to-market transition of 70% of our distribution to Southern Glaciers wine and spirits. The encouraging news, these issues are all stabilizing. We are rebalancing our inventories and expect more standard service levels for the balance of the year. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising organic net sales guidance from 2% to 4% to 4% to 6% for fiscal 2022.  And before I close, just a couple quick notes on Canopy Growth. Clearly, recent results have been disappointing and there are meaningful near-term challenges facing Canopy and the overall cannabis market in Canada as store openings have been slower than previously anticipated due to the pandemic. However, we continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant growth opportunity in the CPG space over the next decade given the predicted U.S market size of roughly 100 billion post-legalization, which is double the size of the spirits market and approaching the size of the beer category. We\u2019re encouraged by Canopy\u2019s innovation agenda, with more than 40 new SKUs launched globally during their recently reported second quarter. In addition, Canopy purchased the right to acquire Wana Brands upon a U.S triggering event which includes U.S federal legalization of cannabis. Wana Brands is the number-one share of the gummy market in Canada with more than 40% market share and the largest multi-market presence in the U.S gummy market. The gummies category is one of the fastest-growing segments in both the U.S and Canadian cannabis markets, accounting for over 70% of all edibles purchased. Wana\u2019s asset-light licensing model approach will allow them to scale quickly in the U.S and provide Canopy a highly-distributed brand upon U.S legalization. In closing, I would like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Our Beer business continues to deliver impressive performance. Its growth remains ahead of the high-end of the U.S beer market in IRI channels and we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth for fiscal 2022. We remain confident in the robust longer-term growth prospects of our Beer business, and we\u2019re securing our ability to capture the significant value creation opportunity by expanding and optimizing our production capacity over the next four years. Our Wine and Spirits business continues to move toward its long-term revenue growth and margin expansion vision which is further enabled by the clearer strategic focus of its newly-configured fine wine and craft spirits and mainstream and premium teams. And in spite of an ongoing challenging environment, our strong overall total company performance gives us the confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the year. We look forward to continuing to build a portfolio of products that consumers love and delivering another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal 2022. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Q3 was another quarter of strong execution by our Beer business. This continued strength, coupled with tax favorability enabled us to deliver 8% comparable basis diluted EPS growth for the quarter excluding Canopy. As a result, we have increased and narrowed our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $10.50 to $10.65 versus our previous guidance of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings, includes an increase in Beer operating income guidance, and reflects a decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2022. Now let\u2019s review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with Beer, net sales increased 4% driven by shipment growth of 3% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant inventory rebuild in Q3 of the prior year which generated 28% shipment growth.  Depletion growth for the quarter came in above 8% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and explosive growth of Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on-premise channel. Again, keep in mind the difficult volume overlap we encountered during quarter as we faced a 12% depletion growth comparison driven by robust inventory replenishment at the retailer in the prior year. On-premise buying accounted for approximately 12% of the total beer depletions during quarter and grew strong double-digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and was only 8% of our depletion volume in Q3 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. Selling dates in the quarter were flat year-over-year, and please note that in Q4 there is one additional selling day. Cases shipped exceeded cases depleted as distributor inventory levels began to rebuild during the quarter. Inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year as shipment volume is expected to continue to exceed cases depleted for the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving on to Beer margins, Beer operating margin decreased 130 basis points versus prior year to 41.3%. Benefits from favorable pricing and marketing planning were more than offset by unfavorable costs.  The expected increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following. First, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that on average are in the mid to high single-digit range predominantly driven by wood pallets, aluminum, steel and cartons. Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging where possible. Second, increased brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased headcount, incremental spend related to capacity expansion, and annual brewery maintenance that was performed during the quarter. As a reminder, the annual brewery maintenance took place during the fourth quarter last fiscal year. And third, a step-up in depreciation expense largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon completed earlier this fiscal year.  These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels.  Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 130 basis points to 8% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Additionally, we continue to expect full year spend as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. For full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales growth to land in the 10% to 11% range and operating income growth to land in the 6% to 7% range reflecting continued the strength of our core beer portfolio. As previously communicated, we expect price increases within our beer portfolio to land slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. However, we anticipate this incremental pricing favorability to be partially offset by unfavorable net sales mix primarily driven by a shift in package types and return of on-premise draft SKUs. We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by cost headwinds predominantly driven by significant step-up in depreciation and increased inflation across numerous cost components as the inflationary environment resulting from economic supply chain and other by-products of the pandemic continues to be dynamic and variable. We now anticipate these elevated inflationary pressures to persist well into fiscal year 2023 and expect inflation on the commodity spend component of direct materials to land on average in the high single-digit to low double-digit range next fiscal year.  We will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to address these evolving conditions through our commodity hedging program, cost saving initiatives, and balanced price adjustments. However, due to a persistent and tough inflationary environment and incremental depreciation driven by our capital expansion plans, operating margins could land below our stated 39% to 40% range in fiscal 2023.  Let me reiterate that these are still best-in-class operating margins within our industry which reflects the strength of our core beer portfolio and efficiencies of our operations. We will continue to refine our outlook for fiscal year 2023 and will provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April. Moving to Wine and Spirits, Q3 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 25% as shipments declined approximately 39%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 3% driven by shipment growth of approximately 3%. Favorable price, incremental sales of crates to Opus One, and small wine sales, all partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletions declined approximately 7% during the quarter and continue to be challenged by port delays for our international brands and distributor route-to-market changes in transition markets. Additionally, depletions faced a difficult overlap, especially for our premium and luxury brands which experienced robust growth during Q3 of the prior year. However, we expect depletion growth to accelerate during the fourth quarter driven by the continued strength of our higher-end brands led by The Prisoner Brand family, Meiomi, and Kim Crawford, a robust innovation agenda, and an easier buying overlap versus a year ago. From a shipment perspective, we expect shipment growth for the fourth quarter to decelerate versus Q3 as we continue to right size distributor inventory levels for our mainstream brands.  Moving on to Wine and Spirits margins, operating margin increased 140 basis points to 25.4% as decreased COGS, mix benefits from divestitures, and favorable price were partially offset by increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales and unfavorable mix from the existing portfolio. As expected, lower COGS were driven by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower rate for raw materials, and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The net favorable fixed cost absorption resulted from lapping the unfavorable impact of $20 million in the prior year which was a result of decreased production levels due to the 2020 US wildfires. This benefit for the quarter was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulting from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a late frost during their harvest season earlier this year. Marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year due to the loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related cancellations and/or postponements. As a result, marketing as a percent of net sales for Q4 is expected to be lower than the prior year. For the full year, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 10% range. For full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales and operating income to decline 21% to 22% and 23% to 25%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is now expected to grow in the 4% to 6% range versus our previous guidance of 2% to 4%.  It is important to note that the increase in our top-line guidance is mainly due to incremental shipments to support our route-to-market transition earlier this fiscal year and revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are one-time in nature and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in future years. As such, going forward, we remain confident in our medium-term top line growth algorithm for the wine and spirits business 2% to 4%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we expect significant cost increases for the business including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures on product, freight, and warehousing costs. However, in order to mitigate some of these cost headwinds, we intend to take incremental price that will be staggered throughout the first half of calendar 2022. We will continue to work through the puts and takes of our full year fiscal 2023 outlook and will provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April. Now let\u2019s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year to date corporate expenses came in at approximately $162 million, down 6% versus Q3 year-to-date last fiscal year. The decrease was predominantly driven by compensation and benefits due to the reversal of an accrual for performance share units which will not be earned due to not achieving the threshold level of earnings performance from our Canopy investment and a favorable foreign currency event. These tailwinds were partially offset by an increase in consulting services and T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $230 million reflecting the year-to-date compensation and benefits favorability. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 8% to $88 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to land towards the midpoint of our previous guidance range of $355 million to $365 million. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 14% versus 17.7% in Q3 last year primarily driven by the timing and magnitude of stock-based compensation benefits partially offset by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximate 19.5% versus our previous guidance of 20%. This half-point decrease primarily reflects the impact of increased stock-based compensation tax benefits received during the quarter. Additionally, stock-based compensation tax benefits were weighted toward Q3 versus our previous expectation of Q4 resulting in a sequential rate increase to our implied Q4 tax rate which is now expected to approximate 23%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 reflecting a 3% increase in operating cash flow offset by an increase in CapEx spending. CapEx spend totaled approximately $600 million which included approximately $500 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion which includes approximately $900 million targeted for Mexico beer operations expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. As Bill mentioned, our Beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S beer industry driven by robust consumer demand and it is essential that we invest appropriately to support the expected ongoing growth momentum for our exceptional beer brands. As such, we have updated and increased our brewery expansion investment plans in Mexico. Total capital expenditures for the Beer business are now expected to be $5 billion to $5.5 billion over the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 time frame with a majority of spend expected to occur in the first three years. In total, this investment will support an incremental 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of additional capacity and includes construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as continued expansion and optimization of our existing sites in Nava and Obregon. Please note that this investment includes the previously-disclosed beer CapEx guidance of $700 million to $900 million annually during the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 time line to support a 15 million hectoliter buildout between our Nava and Obregon facilities. As a reminder, our existing brewery footprint currently supports 39 million hectoliters between Nava and Obregon. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate our medium-term growth expectations for our Beer business. As Bill and I outlined, we expect continued momentum and thus continue to target top line growth in the 7% to 9% range over the next three to five years which includes one to two points of price and implies buying growth in the mid to high single digit range. This expectation provides us with the conviction to support incremental capital investments in Mexico. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : So on beer depletions, another strong result. It was the best two-year average we\u2019ve seen in recent history. So in regards to Q3, can you discuss the underlying strength behind the business and maybe specifically, the market share performance which we saw improve in track channels? And then also, on a go-forward basis on depletions, how sustainable do you think those trends are? Perhaps give us an update on December. You sounded bullish on fiscal Q4 and any updates specifically on December and any thoughts around Omicron variant impact and if that could pose any risk to your business as we look at the on-premise channel or overall to the business. Thanks. William Newlands : Sure, we\u2019ll try and up pack that, Dara. Obviously, we had a very, very strong Q3. As you saw, we saw acceleration during in IRI channels during the quarter as both a couple of things happened. First of all, acceleration of our brands; Modelo was up 13% depletions in the IRI take-out was up in the high-teens in the most recent four-week trends. Corona Extra has just been tremendous for us. It\u2019s been great to watch and see that iconic brand do as well as it has. So we\u2019re very excited about both of those. To your question about December, our year-to-date is up almost 9% in depletions, and I\u2019m very pleased to say December was ahead of that trend and certainly it puts us in position to deliver the fourth quarter and the year that we had anticipated. Certainly the COVID scenario is different. You do see more consumers consuming more meals at home than what we probably saw before the start of the pandemic, and you do see a lot of variations depending on the individual market. Clearly, the on-premise is the one that gets nailed in these type of instances, and again, there\u2019s a lot of variability there.  But consumers are going out more than they did certainly a year ago, and we\u2019re all very hopeful that this particular variant of the virus comes and goes more quickly. It certainly appears that those who are heavily vaccinated have had less overall experience and concerns around that, which ultimately should help the entire country and our business as well as people continue to go out in the marketplace. As you know, we have a Chief Medical Officer who continues to guide us on these important topics so that we make sure we not only keep our people safe, but do everything we can to meet consumer needs while we\u2019re at it. So all-in, we think that we hope we\u2019re progressing against that, but we\u2019re very excited about the position we currently hold across our business and certainly are bullish about how the rest of the year and the close of the fiscal is going to go. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good morning, and happy new year. In your prepared remarks, Garth, you noted that beer pricing is going to be I think you said specifically slightly ahead of your historical average. But as we observe the broader pricing backdrop across beverage alcohol as well as packaged food and beverage, it seems like the consumer is able to absorb a fair bit more pricing than we\u2019ve seen broadly historically. So can you just kind of comment on your appetite to take incremental pricing and perhaps your views around your brand\u2019s price elasticity specifically given your premium pricing? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, thanks, Vivien. And as you know, our typical range for price increases on any given year is kind of in that 1% to 2%, so what we do is we go through the year, we\u2019re looking at our portfolio, we\u2019re looking at the competitive set and we\u2019re looking at individual markets. We take our price increases on a brand-by-brand and on a market-by-market basis, and so we do this as I say in a very disciplined approach. Given the current economic environment this year, we\u2019ve determined that we can take more pricing than we typically have, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us to say we\u2019re going to be slightly above the 2%. Keep in mind we have to make sure that we\u2019re balancing the right level of price increases with what\u2019s going on with our consumer. As you know, we have a consumer set that skews a bit more Hispanic than some of our competitors, and in times of economic downturn, if you will, or weakness, they tend to get hit a little bit harder and they recover a little bit slower, so we want to make sure we\u2019re not leaving any pricing on the table. We want to take as much as we can but we also don\u2019t want to take so much pricing that we impair the performance of our brands or impair the growth of our brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi. If I could just follow-up, Garth, on that, I think you explained how you take pricing in the market-by-market those sorts of things, but it seems pretty clear from everything that we\u2019re seeing as it relates to inflation that the pricing you have in place now is covering it. But can you maybe just talk a little bit further out? It feels like that\u2019s also likely to be the case for next year, so if you could just give some context on pricing for next year? Garth Hankinson : Sure, and thanks for the question. Look, we\u2019re in the middle of our annual planning process, and so we\u2019re taking a look at what we think we can cover next year. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we continue to think that inflation is going to be a big factor for us next year and we still intend to take significant amount of pricing. Where that falls within our range that remains to be seen, but that pricing that we do get hit as I said in my script, it\u2019s likely not to cover all of our inflationary headwinds next year, but just like we did this year, we\u2019re going to look at this on a market-by-market basis, brand by brand basis and we\u2019ll take as much pricing as we think the consumer can absorb. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, and happy new year. I actually just wanted to make sure I understand the different puts and takes for beer operating margins next year. You did mention you expect beer of op margins to likely be below your 39% to 40%, so just maybe wanted to make sure we understand the key drivers of this. First, I think you mentioned the higher cost pressures including depreciation expense, so could you guys maybe quantify a few of these buckets further for us? And then should we assume you\u2019ll be able to generate your typical high single-digit Beer top line growth next year, with maybe possibly better-than-planned pricing that you just mentioned partially offset by negative mix. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so in general, or not in general, but we are sticking to our long term or mid-term growth outlook that is, so as I said in my script, we continue to target over the next three to five years in Beer to have top line growth in that high single-digit range, and as we\u2019ve said historically, we think the right way to think about our margins is between 39% and 40%. However, we\u2019ve also said that in any given year depending on market dynamics or what\u2019s going on in the business that we could fall above or below that range. So I think what I referenced in my comments is pretty consistent with what the we said previously. We\u2019re still, as I said, we\u2019re still in the process of going through our annual planning process, so we\u2019ll give a more update on margins as we close out the year and move into next year. But it is a tough inflationary environment. As I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing inflationary and commodity pressures that are in the high single-digit to double-digit range, and again, we\u2019ll absorb as much of that as we can with pricing and with a robust cost savings initiatives that we have in both wine and spirits and in beer, and we\u2019ll alter our hedging strategy to take care or to take advantage of weakness in commodity prices as we see some weakness, as we recently have in aluminum and heating oil.  So those are all things that we\u2019ll do to try to offset inflationary pressures, but we\u2019ll have more details on the actual margins and outlook for margins at our Q4 earnings call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Good morning, and happy new year. I guess my question is around the brewery, the new brewery in Veracruz and maybe just tying, Garth, back to the 39% to 40% margins over time for Beer. I guess given that the distance that that brewery will sit relative to the border, is there any negative mix implication I guess to margins over time as you begin to produce more beer there, or are there other offsetting factors that would sort of mitigate that? Garth Hankinson : Yeah, thanks, Bryan. Yeah, so we\u2019re still going through the planning process there, but we do think that there are some offsets. So you\u2019re right, it\u2019s further away from the border than say Obregon or Nava. However, it does open up some really interesting shipping lanes to the Eastern half of the US going across the Gulf of Mexico, so we\u2019re looking at those now to see what the impact is. We also, as we\u2019re thinking about building the brewery up, what products we\u2019re going to put into that brewery and what\u2019s the level of complexity, what brands are we going to put in there, can it be highly efficient so that it offsets any margin impact. So still a lot of work to be done on that. I would expect we will have more details on that in our Q4 earnings call as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. Can you just expand on the Fresca partnership, how it came about, envision the timeline of the rollout? I know you said this year, but pace of rollout and how distributed you think this can get, and whether you envision doing more partnerships with the Coca-Cola Company, can you go outside of the U.S? So just a little bit more perspective. Thanks so much. William Newlands : Sure, Chris. This particular partnership around the Fresca brand was one that was very exciting to us. Fresca hits on a number of key consumer attributes, everything from convenience to flavor, and is the hottest diet soda in their portfolio. So the idea when you consider that more than 50% of Fresca consumers already mix it with spirits, it seemed like a natural one for us, and certainly, they felt the same way.  So we\u2019re very excited about the potential for this. Obviously it starts in the United States. We\u2019re still putting a lot of finishing touches on exactly how and what this will be as we get later in the year and certainly we\u2019ll give you a lot more information about that as we get closer to the time where we will launch this product. But certainly, this opens a very interesting door and one that\u2019s exciting, I think, for both companies. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. I know we\u2019ve covered a lot. I wanted to ask about Corona depletions because the brand has had building momentum, getting up to double-digit depletions this quarter. So I think when I\u2019d asked it previously, you didn\u2019t have a great sense for how much of this was driven by on-premise recovery versus the brand performing better in take-home channels, and if it\u2019s the latter, kind of what\u2019s really been driving that change in momentum for the brand. So would love any additional color on that you can offer. Thanks. William Newlands : Sure, Lauren. We\u2019ve noted a number of things as it relates specifically Corona Extra. First of all, as retailers have begun to address their shelving opportunity, we\u2019ve taken advantage of that and improved our distribution profile versus what it had previously been. Second, our marketing effort is doing extremely well and it has been very, very well-received, and that\u2019s driving consumer demand. So we\u2019re very excited about that particular element. And we\u2019ve said this many, many times before, but it remains as true as it ever has been. Corona is one of the most-loved brands in the beer landscape, so I think one of the things that you\u2019ve seen a little bit of in this particular time frame is that the consumer is returning to many of those iconic brands that they love and trust, and Corona is really at the top of the list. We still saw in off-premise continued growth, as you\u2019ve seen in the IRI channels that that continued to develop. On-premise has not gotten itself all the way back to where it was before the pandemic, but as we\u2019ve always said, on-premise was a little bit smaller in the total profile of the Corona brand than it is for some other industry players. So overall, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about it, and certainly, we\u2019re going to continue the great work and the advertising sector. We have a very robust plan for advertising in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re sure that\u2019s going to continue to bear excellent results for our brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nik Modi : Yeah. Hi. Happy new year. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick follow up, and then my question. Just if you can give some perspective around the double-digit inflation, just kind of some of the builds there and what\u2019s driving that. And then the question is, EBI recently announced they\u2019re going to be launching a Corona non-alc beer, and I was curious if you guys have access to that innovation here in the US given how quickly that segment has been growing. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, thanks, Nik. I\u2019ll take the first part, and then Bill can respond to the second. So just on the inflationary front, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing sort of a wide range of increases year-over-year from kind of low to mid-single-digit for things like corn and hops and glass, which obviously is a big driver of our cost build-up. But then you\u2019re seeing some really large increases on things like cartons, which is up in kind of the mid-teens and wood pallets which is up sort of over 30%. And then there\u2019s a number of other line items that range sort of in between those two bookends. So all of that is driving what we expect to be high single-digit inflation overall across for the beer portfolio. William Newlands : And Nik, relative to your question about the particular launch, the IP would certainly be available to us in the United States, but keep in mind that the regulatory environment of what you can put in as additives in the United States is very different than it is in Canada and it would remain to be seen whether or not that would fly in the United States. So it\u2019s sort of a yes and a who knows on that particular answer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is open. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could give us your updated view on the hard seltzer market, and in particular, the interaction between hard seltzers and beer and Corona specifically and maybe further thoughts in terms of where you look to take that business going forward. Thank you. William Newlands : Obviously, Robert, there was a lot of change in the seltzer business over the course of the last calendar year, and certainly, the growth profile has slowed substantially. We still think that there\u2019s going to be some growth in that particular segment. As you know, we have both reformulated and repackaged some of our variety packs which we\u2019ll be bringing out in the first quarter of 2023. We still think that that\u2019s going to be an important part of the overall beer sector, and we\u2019re going to participate in it.  So we are optimistic that that\u2019s going to continue to see growth, albeit it\u2019s probably significantly lower than what everybody anticipated say a year ago, and so it remains to be seen. Most predictions have proven to be challenging, so we\u2019ll not over-predict the question. What we will say is we think we\u2019re putting the right products in the market that have the right flavor profiles that are going to attract consumers going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King of UBS. Your line is open. Sean King : Hey. Good morning. Sort of related to Bryan\u2019s question, but how should we think about the capacity expansion CAGR to 2026 with the long-term beer algorithm? Is it safe to say that the capacity will be exceeding the utilization based on the 7% to 9% growth model, and I guess is incremental capacity typically more flexible or automated because part of your success in this company has been the high utilization of the capacity that you have in place, so just curious on your thoughts on that. William Newlands : Yeah, certainly. One of the challenges that we\u2019ve also identified in prior calls and it remains true today is we said we want to create some redundant capacity. Some of the challenges that we\u2019ve had is we\u2019ve had some one-off events that have caused us some inventory challenges. We think it would be highly beneficial to have some redundancy in the system and part of our expansion plan not only gets after, as Garth pointed out, high single-digit growth profiles for our business for the foreseeable near-term future, but also gives us some redundancy. So in the event that there are any external factors that are in play, it should have less impact on us going forward. We continue to maintain the 7% to 9% growth profile going forward that we\u2019ve consistently said, and certainly we believe that our brands are going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. So this is about investing in growth and it\u2019s one of the very best value creation opportunities for our shareholders in our judgment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy : Great. Hey, good morning, everyone. Bill, I was hoping you could spend a moment on your decision to split the Wine and Spirits segment into fine wine and spirits from mainstream and premium brands. Just the factors driving that decision, how you expect it to drive improved results. And then more broadly, taking a step back, your openness to further divestitures through this reorganization, not drive the results you\u2019re looking for in the segment? Thank you. William Newlands : So I think our thinking around that was in many instances, it\u2019s very different approaches to how the consumer buys and engages with the fine wine and craft spirits sector. That area tends to be higher DTC. It tends to be higher on-premise, and in many cases it\u2019s a little bit of a different skill set. And we realized by segregating those two things, it would give us a chance to both maximize the potential in the mainstream and premium sector as well as maximizing our potential at the very high-end where some of those different and evolving channels are becoming more and more important to us. I think both understand our strategy which is we want to grow our business, we want to improve our margin position to best of class margin structures, and we\u2019re well on our way to doing that. But our view was this was an opportunity to maximize the potential to do that. It also matches up very nicely with how many of our distributors go-to-market where they separate their portfolio and their sales organizations in fine wine and craft sectors and mainstream and premium. So it also matches our organization with the route-to-market approach that many of our distributors take. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks, everybody, and good morning. Maybe circling back on Bonnie and Bryan\u2019s earlier line of questioning on Beer margins and just round it out, if I could; as depreciation presumably ramps further alongside the CapEx build over the next few years, do you think you can get back to that consistent 39% to 40% range beyond fiscal 2023 as you catch up on the current inflation dynamics, or is there a risk that the depreciation build could keep you at least toward the lower end of that range for the next couple years. That\u2019s just kind of a follow-up, clean-up? And then I guess relatedly, as the incremental CapEx commitment just runs through the cash flow statement, just any commentary you have on how you think about capital allocation in terms of how it may impact M&A or further return of shareholders over the next couple years alongside that ramp. Thank you. William Newlands : You bet, Steve. Garth and I have been very consistent about this now for years, quite frankly, of saying 39% to 40% is what we expect to do on a consistent basis. There will be individual years and times where we exceed that when things go in our favor, and there may be occasions where based on certain headwinds we fall slightly below that. But as Garth in fact pointed out earlier today, these remain best of class margins and we very strongly believe 39% to 40% is a very appropriate long-term algorithm for this business. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, and just to put a final point on that, as I said, you\u2019re right, depreciation will ramp up but we\u2019re going through the process right now. We\u2019re looking at the impacts of what\u2019s the right sort of capacity to have or capabilities to have in our breweries and optimizing that. We\u2019re looking at optimizing our transportation. So to the extent that we have any news on that, then we\u2019ll share it with you at our Q4 earnings call. As related to capital allocation, with this increased investment, nothing changes. We continue to have the best portfolio in terms of growth and in terms of margins. That growth and margins generates a significant amount of cash flow. That cash flow allows us to continue to prioritize investment grade rating, return capital to shareholders, and to invest in the growth of our business. So our capital allocation strategy hasn\u2019t changed.  And then the last piece of that is acquisitions, and we continue to say that acquisitions will be used as a portfolio gap filler, and in large part, we\u2019re going to use our venture fund to fill those gaps. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Nadine Sarwat of Bernstein. Your line is open. Nadine Sarwat : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick follow-ups, if I may. First regarding the Fresca agreement, could you give us a sense of the economics of the agreement, what would the impact on margins be, and what edge do you think you and Coke can bring into win in an already-crowded space.  And then the second one on Pacifico. I know you mentioned brown glass bottles. What sort of initiatives do you have in place to mitigate this negative impact, and when can we expect Pacifico to return to its previous growth profile? Thank you. William Newlands : Sure. Relative to the brand, we will be buying concentrate from the Coca-Cola Company and manufacturing, marketing and selling that brand through our network. We\u2019re very excited about it, frankly, because of the strength of the Fresca brand. It\u2019s, as I said earlier, it\u2019s a growing brand. It\u2019s a brand that\u2019s already used. More than 50% of the users use it as a mix with an alcoholic beverage. We think it\u2019s a natural play while also recognizing the low-cal and great flavor characteristics of that individual brand. So we\u2019re very excited about that. We are making progress on brown glass. I think it remains to be seen when we will be back to full competition and obviously it had some bearing on our ability to deliver in the quarter. As we said, brown glass has been a drag against otherwise outstanding results. We expect as we get into the new fiscal year that that will balance out quite a bit and that we will see Pacifico get back to the double-digit growth profile that we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last several years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Happy new year. Just to ask the margin question a little bit different, if I may. Given the new top line depreciation, why not giving guidance on an EBITDA basis?  And related to that, can you please unpack the Beer operating margin assumption for next year landing below 39? If you\u2019re assuming no additional pricing which you normally take I believe October/November and it only would impact the fourth quarter of 2023, and then if there\u2019s any nonrecurring impacts of the depreciation of that on any of the hedges. And as a follow-up on the guidance for fiscal fourth quarter, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re implying any impact of the new variant above and beyond what you were expecting, so but if you can give us comfort on what you\u2019re seeing on the trade and the ability for the distributors to get the beer on shelf and also on-premise. Appreciate those commentary. William Newlands : Let me answer the second part first, and I\u2019ll have Garth answer the first. As we said, we have had a very strong start to our fourth quarter. Our depletions in the Beer business are up ahead of our year-to-date trends in the month of December, and we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to deliver what we\u2019ve said around fourth quarter and the overall fiscal year.  Garth, do you care to take the first one? Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so just on the EBITDA point. Yeah, so of all, that\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s actually something that we think about, do we want to provide that level of detail, very much in a frontal up-front way. Again, as we go through sort of the planning process here and we look at the impacts of inflation, we look at the impact of depreciation, we look at the effects of our capacity expansion to the extent that we think that\u2019s a meaningful way to show our financial results, then we will add it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please make sure your phone isn\u2019t on mute. Laurent Grandet : Oh, sorry. Sorry. Good morning, everyone, and wishing you all a very happy new year. I\u2019d like to talk back on Fresca. I mean, first, will that be reported that brand will be reporting to the Spirits or Wine and Spirits segment or Beer segment? And at what level of margin should we think of, should we be concerned about the level of marketing you would have to spend to launch the brand? I remember you said to launch Corona Seltzer which was a much more known brand, you have to spend about $14 million. So I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about the margin we should think of for that brand. Garth Hankinson : Well, relative to the whole Fresca story, we will bring that to you in our next earnings scenario when we are much further along on the exact launch planning and launch timing, and we\u2019ll give you a more fulsome view of what we plan to do. What we would say, as we said in our release today, this will be going through our distribution network which will largely be driven by the gold network on the beer side and in some states it will go through the wine and spirits network, depending on the regulatory environment of the particular state. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Newlands for any closing remarks. William Newlands : Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your joining our call today. Despite the challenges faced thus far driven by the continued effects of the pandemic, some global chain issues, and a volatile and dynamic inflationary environment combined with severe weather events, we\u2019re on track to deliver again another strong year of financial performance. Our Beer business continues to remain extremely solid as consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust, while our incremental capacity investments in Mexico will position us to capture the ongoing growth opportunities we see within the higher-end of the U.S beer market well into the future.  Additionally, our Wine and Spirits business continues to move towards its long-term revenue growth and margin expansion vision. Overall, we remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful selection of consumer-connected brands which provides us with strong momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.  As a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we\u2019ll be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again, everyone, for joining the call, and I wish you all a safe, happy, and prosperous new year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year 2022 Q4 Full Year Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Year-end Fiscal '22 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal '22 year-end call. Before I get started this morning, I'd like to comment on the announcement made earlier this week relating to the proposal from the Sands family to declassify Constellation's dual share class structure. According to the family's filing, the proposal brings significant benefits that will accrue to the company and its shareholders, including increasing market demand from investors who prefer single-class structures. The proposal is under consideration and will be negotiated explicitly by the Special Committee of our Board of Directors, and any agreement reached with the Sands family will require the approval of that Special Committee as well as our full Board of Directors. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the proposal, it would require the approval of holders of a majority of our Class A common stock that do not also hold shares of our Class B common stock. I'd like to remind everyone that the Sands family proposal was not made in connection with a corporate transaction. Constellation does not intend to comment further on the proposal unless and until a definitive agreement is reached, the proposal is abandoned or otherwise deemed advisable in connection with any further public disclosure by the Sands family. With that, let's proceed with the discussion of our excellent results and our guidance for fiscal '23. As I reflect on our performance for fiscal '22, I'm extremely proud of how our team pulled together to deliver a year of double-digit organic net sales growth and strong cash flow generation. Our team accomplished this while battling through year 2 of the pandemic, including various supply chain challenges, adverse weather events, rising inflation, rapidly shifting consumer preferences and a host of other issues in the surrounding environment. Through it all, we stayed true to who we are and remain laser focused on our consumers and building brands that people love. We launched our consumer-led innovation while continuing to invest in future capabilities needed to win long-term. We continued to deliver on our commitments to return value to shareholders and to serve the interest of all stakeholders by making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. In fact, earlier this morning as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship, we announced our new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by fiscal '25 and to restore 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from critical watersheds and improved water accessibility in disadvantaged communities where we operate in each case by fiscal '25. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to frame up what we believe are key takeaways from our performance in fiscal '22 as we head into our new fiscal year. First, our strong overall performance continues to be headlined by our Beer business, which delivered its 12th consecutive year of volume growth. Our beer portfolio led by our Modelo and Corona brand families posted net sales growth of 11% and added 30 million cases of high-end growth, extending its leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market. Second, our Wine & Spirits business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the fiscal year. Our enhanced focus on consumer-led premiumization in Wine & Spirits continue to yield benefits as our high-end brands outpaced the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category primarily driven by Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner. Third, we continue to execute against our stated capital allocation strategy, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in fiscal '22. We continue to demonstrate this commitment with this morning's announcement of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which, when completed, will bring us to about 75% of our $5 billion goal. Our continued strong performance in fiscal '22 and the investments we continue to make in our core business provide a nice springboard for another successful year ahead. Now let's dive a little deeper into our business performance in '22 and our outlook for the year ahead. One outlook of our success -- one hallmark of our success has been our beer business over the years has been the strength and continuity of leadership. Earlier this year, we announced that Jim Sabia assumed the role of President of our beer business. As many of you know, Jim has played a key role in the success of our beer business for many years, and we look forward to further building on the momentum under his leadership. Jim succeeds Paul Hetterich, who will continue to work with our beer operations team in Mexico to support our ongoing brewery projects in Nava and Obregon as well as the construction of our new brewery in the state of Veracruz. Paul has been a driving force behind the success of our economy, including our beer business for more than 35 years. I look forward to continuing to work with Paul, Jim and the rest of our beer team to accelerate traction of our high-performing beer portfolio in fiscal '23. There are several industry trends that provide a solid platform for our portfolio growth in the year ahead. Total beverage alcohol servings per capita are expected to remain stable with growth of about 1% to 2% annually based on population growth expectations. Premiumization in the beer category is projected to continue with the high-end segment taking share from the mainstream segment. Mexican imports, primarily driven by the Constellation portfolio, are expected to continue to drive traditional beer growth and will continue to be a key driver of gains in the overall beer segment. Significant growth is projected in the flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits, wavered malt beverages with all categories exhibiting strong future growth prospects. The on-premise segment has rebounded and is expected to continue to recover to drive incremental category growth. And finally, 3-tier e-commerce and digitally influenced sales have proven sticky for beer with revenue and share growing significantly. In fact, this channel is forecasted to deliver over-indexed growth relative to other channels. Each of these trends, combined with Hispanic demographic tailwinds that work in our favor, either aligns with the core strengths of our beer business, or our areas where we're investing to build capabilities needed to more fully compete and win. We have one of the most focused and highly efficient portfolios in the industry with a long runway for growth ahead. Our inventory position has been rebuilt, and we have plans to invest aggressively behind our brands in fiscal '23. We also got some exciting new consumer-led innovation on the way. Modelo Especial is the #2 beer brand in dollar sales in the country and has significant distribution runway over the medium-term to facilitate mid- to high single-digit total annual volume growth in the off-premise. Modelo Especial currently under-indexes with non-Hispanic consumers, but have strong momentum in group household penetration, 7% to 20%. I wish it was 70, but it was 20 with these consumers in the past 2 years, yet there's still significant opportunity to close the awareness gap in order to drive further household penetration. For reference, Modelo Especial currently has only 80% of the household penetration of Corona Extra. We believe increasing total market penetration for Modelo Especial to Corona Extra levels will enable access to more than 2 million incremental consumers. Modelo Especial is the #5 draft brand in the entire category, yet it only has 11% national distribution. This distribution opportunity, along with the velocity the brand delivers, makes Modelo Especial draft our biggest on-premise priority. In the F&B space, our Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the #1 Chelada in the U.S. beer market. For Modelo Chelada, we're forecasting double-digit CAGRs in the medium term driven by extended channel distribution with new pack sizes, formats and flavors. Current awareness levels from Modelo Chelada are low relative to other flavor categories and large competitors.  We expect to improve awareness and accelerate growth of Modelo Chelada through maximizing social and digital media investments to broaden our demographic reach to general market consumers as well as Spanish language TV to stay connected to core Hispanic consumers. Within our Chelada lineup, we're aiming for additional growth for a product line that grew over 30% last year, has tripled in size over the past 5 years and where we own almost 50% of the market nationwide. In fiscal '23, we're introducing a 12-ounce, 12-pack of Lim\u00f3n y Sal and a new Chelada flavor, Naranja Picosa, an orange and chili flavor. We're also extending the Modelo brand into new spaces to bring authentic Mexican flavor to both lighter beer styles and favored cocktail-inspired beer. Modelo Oro is a premium, sessionable light Cerveza with low-calorie and carbs rolling out in 3 test markets, Charlotte, Fresno and Houston. This is a full-flavored beer that fits an active lifestyle. Another product aimed at the low-calorie crowd is Modelo Cantarito-Style Cerveza, a beer with fruit juice that mimics a popular Mexican beverage. It's rolling out in Atlanta, San Diego and Arizona and celebrates the strong Mexican culture and heritage we see throughout the U.S. Shifting gears. We're excited by the resurgence of Corona Extra, which continues to be one of the most loved brands in the U.S. beer market. While modest growth is projected for Corona Extra in fiscal '23, this brand has overindexed brand equity, indicating higher growth potential, both for the master brand and broader brand family, including younger and multicultural consumers, where we see significant opportunity to increase buy rates. Corona Extra also has a fairly high household penetration, yet it still lags behind some large competitors. Distribution opportunities also exist for Corona Premier as there are still significant effective distribution gaps versus Corona Extra. And while buy rates continue to grow for Corona Premier, it still trails behind competing brands, indicating a significant opportunity to increase velocity. Premier is currently underdeveloped in the can format relative to its competitors, as experience indicates that cans are the preferred format for light beer drinkers. And we see a significant unlock with the launch of new packages and format sizes. Finally, consumers have embraced Corona Premier in the on-premise, and our craft focus this year is designed to accelerate that trend. For the Pacifico brand, we're forecasting 10% to 15% total annual volume growth in the medium term from distribution alone. We're prioritizing growth in key DMAs for Pacifico to expand off-premise points of distribution in key cities, particularly in the West and Midwest regions of the country, which will be supported by digital media to reach target legal drinking age Gen Z consumers. We'll also activate consumer and customer-specific national accounts retail programs as well as steel marketing and sponsorship to support targeted investment markets. Pacifico had the hottest draft volume trend in the category during the last 52 weeks, followed closely by Modelo. That trend, along with planned unique activations, positions Pacifico to continue to gain awareness with consumers. We've been increasingly focused on upping our game in the spirits-based RTD space with unique and compelling new brands. Last quarter, we announced a new agreement with the Coca-Cola Company for the U.S. market to create a new to state-of-line of spirit-based ready-to-drink cocktails using the well-loved and fast-growing FRESCA brand. FRESCA mix will debut this fall in bottled strips and tequila Paloma labels. In support of our collective fiscal 3 portfolio initiatives, we will continue to leverage our efficient sponsorship of UFC, the college football playoffs as well as numerous NFL, NBA and MLB teams. You'll see a significant increase and media investments to drive sustained awareness and consumer demand. Overall, we plan to recruit new drinkers through advertising, investments in digital media and localized programming. In addition, our portfolio initiatives will be enabled by increasing adoption of our Shopper-First Shelf approach, which continues to drive results and gain traction. We completed 14,000 shopper-first shelf sets last year, our highest total to date. As you can see, our beer portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on compelling category and consumer trends by leveraging our core brands' competitive advantages for existing and new platforms to deliver our medium-term net sales growth target of 7% to 9%. Now let's move on to our Wine & Spirits business. Despite the confluence of factors impacting this business in fiscal '22, including a major distributor transition, migration to SAP, inflationary headwinds and COVID related to logistics and supply chain challenges, this business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the year. Marketplace performance for our higher-end brands continued to outpace the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category primarily driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company. And our increased focus on our higher-end price segments yielded benefits as our fine wine and craft spirit portfolio achieved double-digit net sales growth driven by the Prisoner Wine Company and High West. Our innovation efforts also produced excellent results with growth contributions coming from Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate Sauvignon Blanch which together both held the top 2 slots among new high-end products introduced over the last 2 years as well as the Prisoner [Indiscernible] extensions, High West ready-to-serve packed and Woodbridge's buttery chardonnay in 3-liter box. Heading into fiscal '23, our strategic focus includes commitment to continued premiumization, margin expansion, accelerated growth in DTC channels and continued growth in our international business. Our innovation strategy will be focused on prevailing consumer trends of premiumization, digital, betterment, convenience, sustainability and enhanced flavor profiles. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year, which includes the launch of SVEDKA Gin, Meiomi Red Blend, Kim Crawford, [T-Wine Spritz], Unshackled Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and [Indiscernible] combo ready-to-serve cocktails. Today, we announced 2 small additions to our Wine & Spirits portfolio to complement our premiumization efforts in wine with Constellation's ambition to be the #1 player in fine wine and among the top 5 in ultra-luxury and icon wines. We have acquired the highly acclaimed Oregon wine brand, Lingua Franca. This demonstrates our commitment to building a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3-tier eCommerce while building our fine wine portfolio with a diverse collection of best wines from top wine regions around the world. We also acquired the remaining portion of Austin Cocktails, which began in 2018 as Constellation Ventures focus on female founders. Austin Cocktails is a leader in the fast-growing premium RTD segment of the U.S. beverage alcohol market. It currently is distributed in 28 states and posted depletion growth of 135% in calendar '21 as RTD trends continue to rise to popularity among consumers. Overall, we expect fiscal '23 to be a dynamic year in our Wine & Spirits business. A tighter focus on higher-end brand strengthens the business and strategically positions it for future success. Before I wrap, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on our investment in Canopy Growth. We continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. and we're encouraged by the work Canopy is doing to further sharpen its strategy, rightsize its operating expense structure and capital investments and achieve profitability in Canada while strengthening its competitive positioning in the U.S. In their most recent quarterly results, Canopy maintained the #1 share position in premium flower products in Canada and drove record performance for its BioSteel and Storz & Bickel product lines. We are encouraged by recent Canadian Government changes to beverage equivalency regulations, allowing consumers to purchase cannabis beverages in greater quantities.  And in the U.S., Canopy's THC strategy is anchored by strategic relationships with 2 profitable MSOs, Acreage and TerrAscend, both of which are positioned in high-growth northeastern markets. Canopy continues to progress their U.S. THC strategy by establishing a scalable footprint, best-in-class products and national distribution networks required to unlock the U.S. market upon federal legalization. In closing, I once again want to thank our team as well as our valued distributors and retailers for your efforts in delivering another strong year of performance, and we're just as excited about our prospects for growth in the year ahead. Our Beer business, led by our core iconic brands and consumer-led innovation, is poised to continue extending its leadership position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Our continued focus on premiumization in the Wine & Spirits business is producing results, and we have plans to further focus our Wine & Spirits portfolio towards the higher end in fiscal '23. We remain committed to our previously stated capital allocation strategy, and we remain on track to deliver our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '23. And finally, I'd like to leave you with this. We operate in a very dynamic and seemingly ever changing environment. But over the years, one thing has remained constant. IRI recently came out with its annual rankings of CPG growth leaders, and Constellation was recognized for being one of the top performers yet again. In fact, Constellation has been recognized as an IRI growth leader more than any other CPG company in our peer set over the last 10 years. That's something we're extremely proud of, and we look forward to continuing to keep this momentum going into our new fiscal year.  And with that thought, I would like to turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results in '22 and our financial focus for '23. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 marked another year of solid financial performance and shareholder value creation despite a myriad of headwinds forming our fortitude and resiliency. Our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation allowed us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders for the year. Additionally, as Bill mentioned, this morning, we announced that we are entering into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR agreement to repurchase $500 million of shares during Q1 of fiscal 2023.  Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes the $500 million share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. Once we complete the ASR in Q1, we will be approximately 75% of the way toward achieving our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2023. More on fiscal 2023 in a minute, but first I want to review full year fiscal 2022 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 11%, landing in the upper end of our previous guided range driven by shipment growth of approximately 9% and favorable price, which, as expected, landed slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. These tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix primarily driven by a shift in package types and the return of on-premise draft SKUs. Depletion growth for the year came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the strong return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the fiscal year and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre COVID and was only 6% of our depletion volume in fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. When adjusting for 2 extra selling days in the year, the beer business generated approximately 8% depletion growth. As previously guided, cases shift continue to exceed cases depleted during the fourth quarter, which resulted in distributor inventories returning to normal levels at fiscal year-end. Moving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 110 basis points versus prior year to 40%. Benefits from favorable pricing, marketing as a percent of net sales and mix were more than offset by unfavorable costs. The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following : first, the previously announced obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million due to excess inventory of our hard seltzer SKUs resulting from a slowdown in the overall category; second, increased brewery costs driven by incremental head count, labor inflation in Mexico and increased spend related to capacity expansion; third, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that, on average, landed in the mid- to high single-digit increase range, predominantly driven by wood pallets, cartons, steel, corn and aluminum.  Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging where possible. And lastly, step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 main hectoliters at Obregon completed in early fiscal 2022. These comp headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels in fiscal 2022 versus last year. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9.2% versus prior year. Moving to Wine & Spirits. Net sales declined 19% as shipments declined approximately 34%. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 9% mainly driven by shipment growth of nearly 3%, favorable mix, increased pricing and small tainted bulk wine sales related to the 2020 wildfires. Organic shipment growth was largely driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner partially offset by a decline for some of our key mainstream brands. Depletions declined approximately 6%, mainly driven by SVEDKA, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Woodbridge. These declines were partially offset by the robust growth of our higher-end brands, led by the Prisoner Wine Company of 16%; Meiomi and High West, up 13%; and Kim Crawford, up 9%. Shipment growth was ahead of depletion growth for the year, mostly reflecting impacts from our distributor transition. During the coming year, we expect to rightsize inventory levels in the business. Operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 22.7% as mix benefited from the divestiture and favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend as a percent of net sales and increased costs. Higher costs were driven by increased freight and warehousing costs partially offset by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower break raw materials and cost savings initiatives. Marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year largely due to a loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal 2022 corporate expense came in slightly higher than our previous guidance, finishing at approximately $238 million, up 4% versus last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher consulting, T&E spend and increased depreciation. These headwinds were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits and a favorable foreign currency impact. Interest expense for the year decreased 8% to approximately $356 million primarily due to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. Our full year comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 17.5% versus 18.2% last year primarily driven by a higher level of stock-based compensation benefits. Effective tax rates on our 4 businesses came in lower than expected during Q4, driving tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance. Moving to fiscal 2022 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash. CapEx totaled approximately $1 billion and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $850 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. Pivoting to our full year fiscal 2023 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal 2023, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50, which excludes Canopy equity and earnings. For fiscal 2023, the beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, reflecting 1 to 2 points of pricing benefit within our Mexican product portfolio, which is in line with our typical pricing strategy and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies operating margin to approximately 38%. As previously discussed, the implied decline in operating margin is predominantly driven by gross margin compression as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, we are expecting elevated inflationary pressures to continue throughout fiscal 2023 and estimating inflation on the commodity spend component of raw and packaging materials to land, on average, in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, including the impact of hedging where allowed. These significant inflationary pressures are expected across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel. Second, similar to fiscal 2022, we are expecting incremental brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico is estimated to range between 5% and 6% as well as incremental head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives. Third, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, we are estimating a step-up in depreciation expense as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $295 million or an increase of approximately $45 million. And finally, we expect margin headwinds related to incremental logistics costs in fuel and freight rates for both rail and truck, which is expected to drive an increase in the low to high single-digit range. As previously stated, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda to help partially offset these headwinds, along with expected favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production models. As it relates to beer marketing spend for fiscal 2023, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range.  Shifting to Wine & Spirits. For fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business is targeting net sales to decline 1% to 3%. While this range is outside our medium-term growth goal for the business, it is an anomaly driven by the significant overlap we have from our distributor transition as well as revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are anticipated to be onetime in nature, and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in fiscal year 2023. Excluding these impacts, we expect an underlying Wine & Spirits business to return to its targeted goal of 2% to 4% net sales growth next fiscal year. On the bottom line, we expect operating income to increase in the 4% to 6% range. This implies operating margin to approximate 24.5%, which represents almost 200 basis points of margin expansion. This margin expansion reflects benefits from price, mix and cost saving initiatives to help more than offset significant COGS inflation headwinds mostly related to freight and packaging. Cost saving initiatives include optimizing the Appalachian mix across our portfolio and decreasing the weight of our glass bottles, which also has positive environmental impacts. This is a good spot to update everyone on our Wine & Spirits operating margin expectations in the medium term. Since we provided original targets back in 2019, the operational environment has changed considerably. Inflationary pressures have got significantly worse, driving increased freight and warehousing costs in fiscal 2022 and are expected to continue well into fiscal 2023.  Additionally, while we continue to remove stranded costs from the business, we strategically decided to reinvest more of these savings back into the areas of businesses that are driving growth. Specifically, in DTC, e-commerce, our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio and consumer-led products that are fueled by category tailwinds. As such, we've updated our operating margin goal to reflect these impacts and now expect medium-term operating margins to migrate to a range of 28% to 29% and EBIT margins at approximately 30%, reflecting a leading margin structure for our industry. Before we move on to guidance for the rest of the P&L, I'd like to highlight the new additions to our wine spirit portfolio that Bill mentioned earlier. As part of the evolution to the high end, we acquired Lingua Franca as well as the remaining interest in Austin Cocktails from our ventures portfolio, 2 businesses positioning categories with significant growth tailwinds behind it. From a finance perspective, these transactions collectively, along with My Favorite Neighbor, which was fully acquired in fiscal 2022, were almost entirely self-funded through the sale of one of our successful venture investments, which generated a significant return on investment. Other fiscal 2023 guidance assumptions include the following : corporate expenses to approximate $230 million, interest expense to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million and a comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings of approximately 20%. The increase in our tax rate is mainly driven by a lower level of anticipated stock-based compensation benefits versus fiscal 2022. Rounding up the P&L, noncontrolling interest is expected to approximate $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately $198 million. This share count assumes we execute a $500 million of share repurchases in Q1. We plan to repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. However, we do not know the timing of cadence, and as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, this EPS guidance range does not reflect a prolonged impact from the volatility associated with the ongoing headwinds we've been experiencing on fuel prices and other commodities as the sustained impact of the recent geopolitical events remains unclear. Thankfully, we have no employees who live or work in Russia or Ukraine, and we have minimal commercial disclosure to this part of the world. That said, our thoughts and prayers are with those being impacted by this growing humanitarian crisis, and we wish for a quick resolution to this conflict and return to peace in the region. Turning to cash flow. We expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion targeted for Mexico beer operations expansion. To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal 2022 alone, our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation capabilities enabled us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders as part of our overall goal of returning $5 billion by the end of our fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation priorities augment our organic growth strategy to enable strategic reinvestment where we see category tailwinds. We believe this strategy, combined with excellent execution and returns to shareholders, positions us to be a top-tier shareholder return generator for many years to come.  With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. I wanted to talk just a little bit about Corona. I was actually surprised that in your prepared remarks, you talked about expecting more modest growth in Corona Extra in '23. But the momentum on that brand has been so strong this year, my understanding of anecdotes around performance during the Super Bowl period has been tremendous. So just curious why expecting things to slow down a bit in '23. Bill Newlands : Well, Lauren, we're actually very optimistic that we'll continue to see strong Corona Extra performance. Obviously, as you point out, it was a very pleasant situation for us this past fiscal year, and it significantly outperformed than we expected. But we also have a lot of other priorities in the Corona brand family, as you know. As I stated in my remarks, we expect Premier to be a heavy focus both in the on-premise as well as building out our distribution capabilities in the off-premise. So we're just trying to be sort of aware that we're going to have a lot of overall work across the family, but we expect to continue to see Corona Extra be a continuing growth driver in our overall business. Operator : Our next question is coming from Dan Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So I wanted to focus on beer margins First, just how much visibility do you think you have on the fiscal 2023 beer margin guidance given there's a number of moving pieces? There's also tremendous external volatility including how hedged or locked in on contracts you are on some of your key commodities and might. And what might be some of the bigger risk points in terms of margins? And then second, just on the pricing front, playing devil's advocate, why not be more aggressive than the long-term 1% to 2% algorithm? I'm just having a hard time believing that $1 incremental per case cost on beer is going to be that much of a factor in a trade down decision relative to consumers seeing much, much higher dollar pressure from other areas, whether it's grocery, gas or electricity costs. So just your thoughts around why not being more aggressive on pricing, particularly given the market share volatility and if you're seeing any signs of trade down so far? Garth Hankinson : Thanks, Dara. I'll take the first part of that question on margin and then Bill will comment on pricing. So as we started selling in the second half of last year, the inflationary environment, obviously, have gotten a little bit deeper and more protracted than anyone expected. And so that's why we were focused in January as to the facts we're going to be facing some additional headwinds this coming year. Typically, we're seeing inflationary increases on a year-over-year basis in that kind of low to mid-single-digit range. And this year, we're expecting them in the high single digit to low to mid-double-digit range. You're seeing that across things like glass, which is our biggest component in beer, which is up 6%. Cartons are up 17%. Crowns were up 26%. Wood pallets are up 35%. So costs are definitely under pressure for sure. That being said, we think that we're fairly well positioned as we enter into the year. To be very proactive around this, we've gotten more aggressive with our hedging policy or our hedging practices, I should say. We typically enter a year somewhere hedged in the neighborhood of sort of 50% to 60% on any given line. But this year, we've taken a more defensive posture to make sure that we're really protecting the P&L. As we enter the year this year, we're hedged at about 75% on aluminum, 70% on natural gas, 60% on the core and 90% of diesel. So we're in a pretty good spot. That being said, as you articulated, there's a lot of volatility around commodities, and that's where we're watching as we go through the year, and we're being opportunistic to layer and even been further hedges as we see weaknesses on a day-to-day basis. So we think we're in pretty good shape. But certainly, there's still some exposure just given the depth and the duration of the inflationary environment we're currently in. Bill Newlands : So relative to your question on price, we certainly understand the question, a lot behind it. So let me remind you how we price. We price on a SKU-by-SKU basis, market-by-market basis, and we're going to continue to do it that way. We also are probably a bit more judicious on price, and perhaps we could be. The reality is we need to be sensitive to our consumers. It's a challenging time for consumers across many, many industries. And it's our view that this is not the time to try to put extra burden out on one of the critical things that many people have in their basket, which happens to be our beers. So we're a bit probably more judicious than we might be able to be, but we think this is in the long-term interest. We always say it's a whole lot easier to keep your consumer than to lose them and have to reacquire them. And that's part of what drives our thinking. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : Maybe just a little bit of a follow-on question to Bill, what you were just mentioning. I was just hoping to get some color from you on the consumer and sort of the spending behavior so far this year. I certainly know your products are premium, but curious, are you seeing any signs of down-trading pressure? And then could you talk about how well you think your portfolio will hold up if or when we enter a recession? I know Bill, in the past, you kind of mentioned your portfolio is pretty defensive. So I'd just be curious to kind of hear you revisit that for us. Bill Newlands : You bet, Bonnie. Fortunately, so far, things are holding up very well. One of the things that I've seen over the course of my career in the alcoholic beverage business, is many, many times, when there is recessionary environments, consumers are still interested in our category and almost view it as a small luxury that they can still experience where they might pass on buying a new refrigerator or something that's a bigger purchase. If they're having personal challenges, they still want to engage in some things that they enjoy in their life. And fortunately, our category is one of those. So so far, this continues to hold. And I think it speaks directly to my answer to Dara a minute ago, which is trying to be sensitive to our consumer and to make sure that that we continue to provide our great products to them at pricing that's reasonable given a tough environment. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. ChrisCarey: Just one follow-up on the pricing and then related question. Are you planning on pricing on Corona? Or is that all going in Modelo and the other SKUs? Can you just maybe comment on where the pricing is going to be going in? And then just specifically on Modelo, I think you said mid-single digit to high single-digit in the off-premise. Can you maybe review expectations for on-premise penetration for this fiscal year? And just in general, where you see that as far as kind of innings of developing the on-premise for that specific offering? Bill Newlands : Yes, you bet. So I'll just remind you what I said earlier, which is we look at pricing on a SKU-by-SKU basis and a market-by-market basis. So it's not any individual brand, let's say, where we focus on pricing. It's really on a SKU by SKU, brand by brand. And so there's not in generality, as to your question, on a particular brand. Relative to Modelo, as I also stated earlier, one of our biggest arteritis is really on-premise draft. We're the #5 player in on-premise draft. We're only 11% penetration nationally in that particular format. That's a great opportunity for us to expand our reach, particularly on Modelo Especial. And interestingly enough, it was only beaten out of its growth last year by Pacifico, which I guess is not the worst thing. But certainly, Modelo, we think, has a great opportunity to continue to expand its reach, particularly as we continue to see much greater penetration in non-Hispanic households that's going to be both the on-premise and the off-premise numbers that both you and I quoted earlier. Operator : Thank your next question today is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Garth, can you maybe talk about the logic behind doing an ASR versus just buying in the open market over the course of the first quarter? Garth Hankinson : Sure. Thanks, Kaumil. Look, we're going to use the same approach this year that we used last year, which is we're going to use all sort of the tools that are available to us to buy back the shares that we need to buy back in order to meet our obligations. So last year, we used an ASR in the second quarter. We also took advantage of a 10b5 and 10b18 program. So we're going to do that for the -- we can optimize the timing of the -- of our repurchases as well as appropriately dollar cost averaging, dollar cost average out here to make sure we get the best value for this. And we opted to use the ASR in the first quarter because we're going to get the benefits earlier in the year. And also, I think that it's a good time for us to buy it. Operator : Thank your next question today is coming from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Vivien Azer : I just wanted to offer, I think it's really reassuring to investors how consistent you guys have been in terms of the commentary on capital allocation today. So thank you for that. In terms of my question, I also wanted to focus on pricing in the health of the consumer but perhaps pivoting to the Wine & Spirits business. Clearly, you guys have done a ton of work to premiumize your portfolio. So given the portfolio evolution in Wine & Spirits, how does that change your thinking around your ability to take price there? Bill Newlands : I think it largely depends on the sector of the wine business in which we're discussing. As you know, mainstream is actually down, although we're gaining share in a down market. And that's the way we think about it. Let's gain share in the mainstream of the business. On the other hand, as you move up the price ladder, you're seeing significant acceleration, and many of our brands are performing extremely well, and it does give us some opportunity to increase our pricing and doing probably even a better job of covering some of the inflationary increases that we see in the beer business.  So I think you should expect them to see a bifurcated answer where we need to be sensitive to what the marketplace is giving us in the mainstream but there's probably some opportunity as you look at the premium and up sections to be a little bit more aggressive in the pricing arena. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : So just a quick housekeeping item, and then I have just a real question. Just, Bill, if you can just comment, given the rules around ASRs and material nonpublic information, can I presume that Constellation is not sitting on some news regarding a large M&A transaction? So that was just a clarification. And the real question is any update on how March depletions look. Some of the channel work that we did suggested some very strong results that look to be an acceleration sequentially from what you guys showed this February quarter. So any thoughts on that would be helpful. Garth Hankinson : Nik, this is Garth. I'll take the first part, and then I'll turn it over to Bill. I think it speaks for itself that Constellation is fully aware of and comprise all of our obligations under state and federal securities laws. And relative to your question of how March was, Nik, we're pleased that it's at least consistent with our annual algorithm despite huge comps that we faced in March of last year. So we're pretty pleased that we got off to a good start. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So Garth, I had a question about just the Wine & Spirits margin outlook medium term. And one thing just in terms of, I think you gave kind of 2 sets of numbers. One was 28% to 29% operating margin and then the other was approximating a 30% EBIT margin over time. And just are those different? Or are we just saying that we still think we can get back to the 30% margin? I was a little just confused about the language there. Garth Hankinson : Yes, sure. So on the operating profit margin question, yes, so we are coming in at 28% to 29%. The difference between operating margin and EBIT is the addition of our -- what we take in from equity earnings and Opus One. Operator : Your next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Nadine Sarwat : I want to touch on Corona Hard Seltzer for a little bit. So that brand continues to underperform the broader seltzer market. So what's your strategy going forward with the brand? And then maybe taking a step back, a broader question related to this. What lessons have you learned from launching Corona Hard Seltzer? And how is this going to influence your approach to rolling out innovation in the future? I think you called out a number of those in your prepared remarks. Bill Newlands : Obviously, the seltzer market has developed very differently than what we had anticipated. And frankly, it's been more of a challenge than what we had anticipated as well. As you know, this year, we're doing a number of things. We're repackaging, as we said, in prior quarters. We are getting much more focused on where we bring differentiated products rather than me-too products into that particular sector. But we still feel that, that's going to be a growth segment of the overall beer business, and we're going to participate in it. So relative to lessons learned, I think a couple of things are always important. It's important to test. We're obviously doing tests as it relates to our Modelo franchises to make sure that we have consumer propositions that are best of class and that are going to win with consumers. And we're going to continue to operate under that approach going forward. Operator : Our next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. RobOttenstein: Terrific. Just kind of swinging back to the question on seltzers and taking it a little bit broader. Clearly, a lot of the excitement on that segment is gone. From your perspective, is there actually a silver lining in that such that retailers and distributors will spend more time, energy on your brands, and that should be something that you should benefit from going forward? And then connected to that, are you starting to get a little bit more of the shelf space that you guys have earned given the tremendous brands and velocity that you've had and the fact that you've been undershelved in the past? Bill Newlands : Robert, you definitely put your finger on a benefit of the scenario that the seltzer business has not been quite what we expected, which is -- it's very mix-accretive. So the more beer we sell, the better the mix. So that's the flip side of the seltzer business for us is not developed quite the way we had anticipated, as you point out. I think you make a very good point relative to shelf space. One of the things that occurred during the pandemic is many retailers just didn't redo their shelves to the degree that we would have expected or that you would see on a typical annual basis. And there's no question that the growth profile of our overall portfolio not only demands but really should have more shelf space. So this is going to be a critical part of what our sales organization is driving for this year, is to broaden our reach and package sizes and depth within stores.  I mentioned the Shopper-First Shelf initiative, which we actually had a pretty good year on last year. We expect to extend that this year. It's good for the category, it\u2019s good for us. So a lot of work will be done on that very topic this year, as you point out. And we think it will be in everyone's interest, ours plus the retailer, to give our brands more shelf space. They've earned it. Operator : Our next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. First, a housekeeping question on the Sands proposal, which Bill, I think you can't comment on, when do you expect the Board to vote on that proposal before potentially putting it out to the Class A shareholders? And then the broader question, Bill, just your perspective on the slow start to the year for the U.S. beer industry.  So your data looks good. The results were obviously very good today. The Nielsen data continues to look good in the month of March for Constellation and probably even is a bit better, given some of the noise we understand in the Nielsen data in the last week of March. But I just wanted to get your perspective, more broadly, on what you think is driving that. I think there's some year-over-year comps at play, the seltzer slowdown, as you commented. But anything you're seeing that's potentially sort of concerning that you're watchful of, particularly around the consumer that may sort of play out here as it pertains to your portfolio? So your thoughts there would be helpful. Bill Newlands : You bet. So just relative to your question about the Sands proposal, we've been advised that transactions of this nature typically takes 60 to 90 days. Beyond that, it's really out of our hands. The management is not involved in the discussion, the discussions between the Sands family and the special committee of the independent directors of the Board. So I don't have the exact answer to that question, believe that by 60 to 90 days is very typical. So we shall see. Relative to the start of the year, I think everybody recognized January was a bit of a tough month. It was for every -- I think everybody in the industry. A little bit of that was where New Year's fell, there were weather events, Super Bowl got pushed out an extra week versus what it was the year before. But I think the exciting part for us is it was a very, very strong February, and as I responded to Nik 2 questions ago, March has been very strong as well in the start of our fiscal year. So I don't think there's anything that's overarching as an issue within the category but certainly not as it relates to our business. We continue to be very pleased with how our brands are performing. And as Garth pointed out in his prepared remarks, we've gotten our inventories back in the right position. So brands like Pacifico, which we were a little challenged for a while on brown glass, we have gotten through that. Some of those kinds of things, which were sort of detrimental to an otherwise very strong performance here, we've now fixed. So we're in a much better position heading into this fiscal year than we were last year where there were just a lot of extraneous things that were not helpful to us. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Andrea Texeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I just wanted to double-click on the opportunity to improve mix with the shift to on-premise. You had, I think, 3.8% price/mix expansion in the quarter. Can you still have around -- my calculation\u2019s around the 100 basis points tailwind? And do you expect this to be -- price/mix to be embedded in your guide around 400 basis points? I just want to double check that. And on Wine & Spirits, I think Bryan, Vivien asked good questions regarding the outlook. Is there any reason why it was a bit disappointing? I know you're making a lot of investments to premiumize the portfolio. But anything to kind of give us more comfort that besides the Opus One impact, what is impacting there and if there is a better outlook towards the long term? Bill Newlands : Sure. Let me touch on the second piece first. We're still very pleased with the development, particularly at the higher end of our Wine business. As Garth pointed out, we had 2 or 3 one-off items that were a bit challenging based around the distributor transition that occurred last year and some sale of smoke tainted wine from prior years. If you would exclude those things, we're in a growth profile for our wine business, and that's being driven by the higher end. The work that Robert Hanson and the rest of the team have done to refocus our attention towards the high end in the growth sector of the wine business I think is exactly what we expected to do. It's the strategy we began and undertook a couple of years ago, and we're continuing to execute against it. So despite the significant headwinds, as I said earlier, in the mainstream sector of the business, we're very pleased with how things are developing at the higher end. And we're comfortable that our longer-term algorithm of 2% to 4% in the wine business will be achieved sooner rather than later. Garth Hankinson : And relative to your first -- the first part of your question, if I understood it correctly, you're pointing out that, in Q4, we had sort of a 4% points of pricing and whether or not that's going to continue. Our outlook for next year assumes that we're going to get our -- more in line with our typical 1% to 2% pricing. So that's sticking in line with our normal outlook. Operator : Our next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great. I actually wanted to follow up on both those those 2 questions and your answers there. So on the beer side of things, the 1% to 2% pricing outlook, you're saying that that's inclusive of any mix impacts. I want to clarify that. And then on the wine, Bill, given the decision to reinvest stranded overheads towards additional growth, as you think about that 2% to 4% objective, are you biased, over time, higher within that range because of accelerated reinvestments? Or is the takeaway that the -- just sort of the cost of achieving that top line has just gone up a tick because of -- probably because of mainstream dynamics, but just your perspective there. Bill Newlands : I think relative to the second piece of that, there's no question that there's obviously been an inflation, which is making a bit of that more challenging than what it had been prior. But I would like to point out something related to what Garth said in his prepared remarks, which is we've been very judicious, and thank you, Vivien, for your comment about our careful capital allocation. But I think this is a great example of it, we made 3 small purchases in the Wine & Spirits business almost entirely funded by the sale of one of our venture businesses, which was sold at a significant increase versus what we paid. So again, I think this begins to reflect a very judicious view of how we think about capital allocation and it\u2019s very consistent with what we've promised externally. We do believe that we are going to see significant success going forward, particularly at the higher end of the business. I think the only thing that's going to potentially challenge that or be a challenge to it is where the mainstream business goes. As I said earlier, that's in the category that's been declining, and we're gaining share. So we're still winning in that category, but it's a tougher segment of the category. Certainly, we expect high single digits growth profile or even better at the higher end portion of our business. And you're seeing that in brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner and High West. So I think, over time, you're going to be pleased with what you see in the profile of our wine business. And this year will be a continued step in that direction. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Newlands for any further or closing comments. Bill Newlands : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm extremely proud of what our team accomplished in fiscal '22. We delivered strong financial results, continued to launch consumer-led innovation and reinforced our efforts to making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. Our beer business extended its leadership position with its 12th consecutive year of volume growth, and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum in fiscal '23. Over the medium term, we continue to see a strong runway for growth, supported by favorable industry trends for our portfolio and our ongoing investments in brewery capacity expansions. Our Wine & Spirits business also delivered solid performance in fiscal '22 with organic net sales growth and gross margin improvement. We are enhanced -- focused on consumer-led premiumization continued to yield benefits as our high-end brands outpaced the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category.  Overall, we remain bullish on the future performance of our business, in our ability to deliver value for our shareholders, as reflected in our announcement of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program.  Again, I thank you all for joining today. We look forward to speaking with you in late June during our next quarterly call. And before then, we hope you will certainly choose some of our fine products for your Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day celebrations. Thank you very much again. Have a great day, everybody. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for opening remarks. Please go ahead, Patty. Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Q1 Fiscal '23 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started today, I wanted to take a minute to recognize Patty, who, after 15 years with Constellation, has elected to retire next month. We appreciate Patty's commitment in helping shepherd our Investor Relations function since joining the company in 2007. And on behalf of all of our team here at Constellation, we thank Patty for her many contributions to our success over the years, including managing our relationships with a number of folks on this call. We wish her the very best in retirement. Effective July 1, leadership of our IR function will transition to Joe Suarez, who joined Constellation last November as Vice President of Investor Relations. Joe previously served as Managing Director at Teneo, a global CEO advisory firm. Prior to his time there, Joe also served in a range of commercial, governance, finance and investor relations roles for a couple of major players in the global resources sector. We look forward to the continued success of our Investor Relations function under Joe's leadership. With that, let's move on to a discussion of our first quarter results. We're off to a strong start in our new fiscal year, thanks to the solid fundamentals of our business, the disciplined execution of our strategy and the relentless commitment of our Constellation Brands team as well as that of our distributors and retail partners. Our performance in Q1 fiscal '23 continued to build momentum in 3 key areas tied to our long-term goals. First, our beer business once again delivered industry-leading share gains with Modelo Especial and Corona Extra taking the #1 and #4 spots among share-gaining brands across track channels. The business achieved an important milestone, having reached more than 5 full points in shares gained over the last 5 years. Coming back to Q1. Our beer business delivered net sales growth of 21% and added nearly 15 million cases in incremental shipment volume. As anticipated, these significant increases were partly driven by the lapping of supply challenges as a result of severe weather impacts in Q1 fiscal '22. For clarity, ships and depletes in our current quarter were roughly equal on an absolute basis. Importantly, our shipments mainly were underpinned by continued strong demand for our authentic Mexican beers, our consistent and balanced approach to pricing and the effective ramp-up of new brewing capacity from our organic growth investments. Second, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category in tracked channels, where we gained share supported by strong performance of our higher-end brands. Our Wine & Spirits business grew net sales by 2% and saw overall U.S. depletions increased by over 1% with the premium wine and fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio achieving 8% and 16% depletion growth, respectively, with brands like Meiomi, the Prisoner, High West and Casa Noble delivering double-digit depletion growth rates; and third, our sustained and strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to continue to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to invest behind the momentum of our beer business with a focus on growth and flexibility, and we exceeded our planned $500 million accelerated share repurchase activity with an additional $800 million in buybacks. In fact, we have now fulfilled the share buyback portion of the $5 billion goal in cash returns to shareholders that we promised. Now let's discuss in more detail our beer business performance. We maintained our #1 position as the #1 supplier in high-end beer in the U.S. and achieved depletion growth of almost 9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and our growth profile target. As for Memorial Day, which celebrations took place within the quarter, we were the #1 share gainer for that holiday, capturing 1.5 share points of total beer and 2.3 points of high-end beer in the U.S. tracked channels. In the on-premise, our beer business achieved a 30% depletion growth rate across the portfolio and delivered double-digit growth for the Corona and Modelo brand families as well as Pacifico. As mentioned, Modelo Especial remains the number one share gainer in tracked channels, adding over 1.2 points in incremental share, nearly double the incremental share of the second largest gainer. Overall, Modelo Especial delivered the total depletion growth above 15% for the quarter. Our Modelo Chelada brand family grew in line with our medium-term double-digit CAGR expectations, achieving over 39% depletion growth in the quarter. The national release of our new Lim\u00f3n y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped this popular flavor of our Chelada brand delivered the 15th largest share gain across the entire U.S. beer category in tracked channels. And although it is still very early days for our other Modelo innovations, we are encouraged by the initial data we're seeing in test markets, particularly for [Oro] (ph). We continue to be encouraged by the sustained healthy growth of Corona Extra. This brand delivered over 4% depletion growth for the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, was the #4 share gainer in the U.S. beer market in tracked channels. We continue to expect modest growth for Corona Extra in fiscal '23. And Pacifico delivered depletion growth of more than 20% for the quarter. We continue to expect Pacifico to grow in line with our medium-term 10% to 15% total annual volume growth forecast in fiscal '23. All in, our beer business delivered strong net sales growth for the quarter and this, in turn, supported a double-digit increase in operating income. Looking ahead, we're confident that our beer business remains well positioned to deliver against our net sales and operating income growth targets for fiscal '23 despite the ongoing inflationary pressures affecting consumers. We'll continue to take appropriate pricing and cost management actions to ensure we maintain both the growth algorithm of our brands and our industry-leading margins. We'll also continue to support our consumer-led innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year. which will include the launch of our Fresca Mixed vodka spirits and tequila Paloma flavors in early September. And we continue to make progress with our brewing capacity additions including our new brewery to be built in the state of Veracruz. During the quarter, we were pleased to have formally announced the location of our new brewery with the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as well as with both the Governor of the State of Veracruz and the Mayor of the city of Veracruz along with federal, state and municipal authorities. The new brewery will be located in the port of Veracruz, one of the most prominent seaports in the region and will have ample access to water and necessary resources and a highly capable workforce as President Lopez Obrador himself has stated. We look forward to continuing the remarkable journey of our strong performance of our beer business with a focus on both growth and flexibility as we deploy the investments needed to meet steadily rising demand for our products. Now let's move on to Wine & Spirits. Our strategy to increasingly focus on higher-end brands, aligned with ongoing consumer-led premiumization trends, continues to enhance the commercial performance of our Wine & Spirits business. The premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio all significantly outperformed their corresponding categories in tracked channels. Meiomi, the Prisoner and Kim Crawford remain the driving forces behind our premium and fine wine growth with continued share gains in tracked channels and strong increases in depletions. And in craft spirits, our High West and Casa Noble brands delivered dollar sales growth ahead of the competition. We maintained share in mainstream wine with Woodbridge primarily driving that performance. Our innovation efforts also continued to produce excellent results with Meiomi Red Blend becoming the second largest new product growth contributor in the wine category in just over a quarter since its launch. And we are seeing incremental growth from the expansion of our Wine & Spirits brands into international markets with particularly significant gains of more than 60% in international shipment volumes for our fine wine and craft spirits products. As with our Beer business, we continue to closely monitor the state of consumer and remain disciplined in our approach to ensure we balance both pricing and growth across our Wine & Spirits portfolio as economic conditions further evolve. That said, while consumers are reporting increasing concerns about the economy, these concerns have not yet translated into significant behavior change for beverage alcohol shoppers, particularly for our major brands. In total, beverage alcohol servings per capita in the U.S. have remained and are expected to remain stable with growth of 1% to 2% based on population growth expectations. Against that backdrop, we are encouraged by the continued strength of our high-end beer and Wine & Spirits brands in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive additional growth for both businesses over the medium term. To that end, we are accelerating our investments in digital capabilities to further support future growth. These investments will be focused on securing the talent and enhancing the technologies needed to further optimize our marketing efforts and reinforce our leading position in 3-tier e-commerce and DT sales as well as unlock value from enhancements to our procurement, supply chain management, plant operations and back office activities. Online beverage alcohol sales remain over 4 point times the pre-COVID rates and we are seeing great traction with our DTC and 3-tier e-commerce efforts, having outperformed the competition by 3.5 points in these channels over the first quarter. We are now planning additional investments as part of these efforts this fiscal year and expect the total impact of this digital business acceleration program to ultimately result in incremental earnings to be realized over the coming years driven by more effective marketing as well as more efficient supply chain, procurement, data and analytics and operations platforms. Garth will provide additional details in just a few minutes. Beyond the growth, we continue to expect from our businesses which will be further supported by our digital business acceleration program. We also continue to believe that our ownership position in Canopy represents a compelling opportunity in developing -- in a developing industry with significant long-term growth potential. Within that context, we think Canopy's focused on premiumizing its cannabis-branded portfolio to improve performance in Canada is appropriate. And we are also supportive of its efforts in the U.S. to strengthen the distribution of its emerging CPG brands and build a competitive THC ecosystem as Canopy continues to gain traction. Canopy's agreements with Acreage, TerrAscend, Wana and Jetty, position it to quickly scale operations across the U.S. upon federal legalization. We continue to support Canopy through our strategic relationship sharing our experience and capabilities to support the continued advancement of their U.S. strategy, specifically in the areas of commercial sales, marketing and operations. And as announced yesterday, part of our holding in Canopy's convertible debt will be transitioned into equity, which will reduce Canopy's debt while maintaining our share of equity ownership without putting additional capital at risk. On a separate note, earlier today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a proposal to eliminate our Class B common stock. After an extensive review and analysis by the special committee and with the special committee's recommendation, our Board agreed that it is in the best interest of the company and all Constellation shareholders to eliminate the Class B common stock. Under the proposal, owners of our Class B common stock, which are primarily the Sands family, would convert those shares into Class A common stock and receive $64.64 per share in cash, which equates to a total amount of $1.5 billion. The transaction requires shareholder approval, including approval of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock not held by the Sands family or their affiliates, executive officers of the company or Directors that also hold Class B common stock. Once shareholder approval is received, we expect that the proposal would deliver a number of corporate governance and other benefits, including the elimination of the higher vote Class B common stock, including the associated voting control of the Sands family and a reduction in the concentration of voting power; a simplification of the company's equity capital structure to better align the voting rights and interests of all shareholders; a broader appeal of our shares to a larger base of investors who prefer single voting class common stock structures; operating cost savings associated with executive salary and certain benefits as well as administrative savings from maintaining the Class B common stock. We expect the executive salary and benefits cost savings will be about $15 million to $20 million per year using the $17.5 million midpoint of that cost savings range and our current trading multiple of approximately 21x PE. That equates to roughly $300 million of value on a tax-effective basis. Other corporate governance benefits include a rotation of the lead independent Director position on the Board at the next available normal cycle opportunity. And finally, a shift to majority voting in uncontested elections from the current plurality standard for our Board of Directors and the adoption of a Board anti-pledging policy. We will be seeking the approval of shareholders at a special meeting, and a proxy statement, including all details of the proposal will be available ahead of that special meeting. In the meantime, the announcement we made this morning related to the proposal can be found on our company website, cbrands.com. And at this point, we will be unable to comment further or provide additional information on the proposal during today's call beyond what is available in that announcement. In closing, I once again want to recap the 3 highlights I shared earlier on our performance in the first quarter of fiscal '23. First, our beer business continued to achieve industry-leading share gains, driven by our high-performing Modelo Especial, Modelo Chelada, Corona Extra and Pacifico brands delivering overall strong financial results with double-digit growth for both net sales and operating income. Second, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category and tracked channels, particularly through the strong performance of our higher-end brands and also grew net sales in the quarter. And third, we continued to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities, including through the $1.3 billion return to shareholders and share repurchases through June and dividends for the first quarter of this year. We are now at over 90% of our $5 billion promised goal. We were very encouraged by the continued strength of our business in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive sustained growth over the medium term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Garth, who will give you more detail of our financial results in the quarter. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 is off to a great start. We're executing against our business strategy, and we're on track to achieve our targeted financial performance goals for the year. Our beer business achieved double-digit net sales and operating income growth, and our Wine & Spirits business is progressing as marketplace momentum accelerates for the portfolio. In addition, our strong cash flow results enabled us to accelerate and complete our share buyback as we repurchased 5.3 million shares for $1.3 billion through the first 4 months of our fiscal year. As a reminder, one of our key capital allocation priorities has been to return $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases by the end of fiscal '23. To date, we've completed the share repurchase portion of this commitment well in advance of our year-end target. As such, we are now forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 186.5 million for fiscal 2023, which includes share repurchases through June only. As is typical, since we do not know the timing and cadence of future share repurchase activity, any additional share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. Now let's review Q1 fiscal '23 performance in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 21% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 17% from ongoing robust demand for our core portfolio and favorable price. As a reminder, we're seeing a favorable shipment volume overlap versus last year's Q1, which was impacted by supply shortages and missed shipping days as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico. Depletion growth for the quarter came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. Q1 shipments were generally aligned with cases depleted as distributor inventories remained at normal levels. The on-premise channel grew more than 30% in Q1 and now accounts for approximately 13% of our depletion volume versus 11% in Q1 fiscal 2022 when the on-premise channel continued to be somewhat affected by the pandemic. Moving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 40.2% primarily driven by the expected impact of inflationary headwinds, leading to increased COGS for transportation and material costs, including pallets, cartons, steel, corn and aluminum. Additional factors include higher depreciation and brewery costs associated with planned capacity additions at our Obregon production facility in Mexico. These headwinds were partially offset by the favor overlap from 2 items : one, fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels compared to last year's Q1 driven by the weather events I just mentioned; and two, decreased obsolescence primarily related to hard seltzers. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9% versus prior year. We continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for the year. For full year fiscal '23, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for the year. Throughout the remainder of the year gross margin will be negatively impacted as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, elevated inflationary pressures will continue throughout fiscal 2023 across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel. In addition, we'll see increased logistic costs for fuel and freight rates for truck and route. Second, we're expecting incremental brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico as well as increased head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives at both Nava and Obregon. Third, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, the step-up in depreciation expense will continue as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year. Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q1 fiscal '20 net sales increased 2% driven by a combination of increased shipments and favorable price and mix. Q1 depletion growth was driven by double-digit contributions from Meiomi, the Prisoner brand family, High West and Casa Noble. Operating margin decreased 330 basis points to 19.6% as mix and price benefits, combined with a favorable inventory adjustment, were more than offset by higher COGS driven by inflationary headwinds, including higher material costs for grapes and glass, as well as increased transportation and warehousing costs. SG&A and marketing increased as a percent of net sales versus the prior year primarily driven by increased head count and marketing initiatives to support key growth areas of our business. For full year fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business continues to expect net sales to decline 1% to 3% with an increase of 4% to 6% in operating income, implying operating margins of about 24% for fiscal '23. Despite unit Q1 margin results, we expect to achieve our Wine & Spirits margin goals for the year through a combination of the following initiatives that are primarily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect ongoing premiumization and mix improvement driven primarily by our fine wine business and the timing of the vintage transition for these products. We have planned incremental pricing actions beginning in the second quarter. A strong New Zealand vintage coming online is projected to drive volume and enhanced margins. And finally, we expect to see benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. This is a good point to provide additional detail regarding the digital business acceleration initiative that Bill outlined a few minutes ago. Constellation is already an emerging digital business today with impressive progress in key areas such as DTC, 3-tier e-commerce and digital marketing. The digital business acceleration effort will help to create a more cohesive digital strategy and is an entirely new way of doing business that is designed to enable us to become best-in-class initially in the areas that include procurement, end-to-end supply chain planning and marketing optimization. The implementation of our new SAP platform last year enabled a framework for us to proceed with this initiative, which is expected to add $35 million to $40 million in corporate expense this year. As a result, our initial corporate expense guidance increased from $230 million to a range of $265 million to $270 million. We expect to start to see some benefits from these investments later this year. Our fiscal 2023 EPS comparable guidance of $11.20 to $11.50 remains unchanged despite the lower share count. Corporate expenses as a percent of net sales remains at about 3%, which is at the level that had been trending during the SAP implementation. In fact, the Q1 increase in corporate expense of approximately $7 million was primarily driven by investment spending for our digital business acceleration initiative. You can expect to see the majority of the remaining fiscal 2023 spend for this project to occur in Q2. Comparable basis interest expense for Q1 increased slightly due to higher average borrowings, and we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.2x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. During Q1, we entered into an agreement that amended and restated our senior credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our existing revolving credit facility from $2 billion to $2.25 billion and extended its maturity to 2027. In addition, we issued senior notes and subsequently repaid the 2018 3.2% senior notes and the 2013 4.25% senior notes that were coming due next year. We believe that this was the appropriate action to take in a rising interest rate environment. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $562 million, which represents a 7% decrease versus prior year driven by a 73% increase in CapEx investments to support planned capacity expansions and related activities in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments targeted for Mexico beer operations expansion. In closing, our excellent performance and strong business fundamentals demonstrate that we are committed to generating net sales and operating income growth while returning value to shareholders. Our path to impressive Q1 results were paved by great execution in growing our core business and supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and operations. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Just 2 questions for me. One is as we think about the -- assuming that the shareholder proposal gets approved and there's the $1.5 billion outlay, how would we finance that? And are there any offsets to offset the incremental cost of financing? And then second is just as we think about the incremental -- the accelerated investment in digital, should we think about that as being part of the kind of the cost base going forward? So is it a multiyear investment? Or you're just having a good year and you figured you'd spend -- you'd sort of pull forward some of the expenses. So really those 2 things, how we think about offsetting the incremental cost, I guess, of the $1.5 billion; and then how to think about the digital investments. Garth Hankinson : Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So I'll take those in that order. First, on the funding of the $1.5 billion. First of all, we're in a very enviable position given the strength of our balance sheet and given our investment-grade rating. We're -- obviously, given the timing of this proposal, we're still thinking through exactly how we're going to fund the $1.5 billion, but likely will include some new debt and may or may not include some of our existing debt that we have available to us under the revolver. So there will be more to come on that as we move forward. That being said, whatever we do, we do remain committed to our investment-grade rating, and we intend to remain within our targeted leverage range and can do so as we support this commitment. On the digital business acceleration cost, so -- this is -- this will be a multiyear program that's in place. What the spend will be in future years? We will work on that as we move through this year and into next. But this is not a pull forward per se, this will be incremental investment, and so you'll see more about that, as I said, as we move through this year and into next. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : All right. So I guess the key question this morning that we're hearing from investors is on your full year guidance and why you maintained it despite the significant outperformance in Q1 and also thinking about the significant repurchases. So I guess we're all trying to understand your level of conservatism, especially considering it implies that your beer shipments only grow about 3% for the balance of the year despite what I think is pretty darn good momentum behind your brand. So what are we all missing? I mean maybe you guys could sort of lay out for us some of the key puts and takes to help us better understand this. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Bonnie. So Bill and I will probably try to tag team a little bit in response to your question. So I would say, first of all, Q1 was on our estimates for the quarter, keeping in mind, as we stated, as we entered the year that this year would be a bit lumpy just like last year was a bit lumpy as we've been overlapping the production issues we had last year. So you'll continue to see some of that lumpiness. For the balance of the year, I would say that we continue to expect that we're going to have strong depletions, and we will continue to have shipment growth that is in line with our long-term algorithm. So the business will continue very much going forward in a very strong manner. As it relates specifically to the guidance, I kind of alluded to this in my scripts, while we did get a benefit from the share repurchases, obviously, from retiring more shares and reduced share count, we also introduced today the incremental spend on the digital business acceleration initiative. And those 2 things kind of net out against one another. And for that matter, as we look again to the balance of the year, it's just a little bit too early for us to make any adjustments given that we're still monitoring macroeconomic conditions as well as what those economic conditions, including inflation, have on the consumer. Bill Newlands : Yes. The only thing, Bonnie, that I would add to that is I always try to look at what our depletion rate looks like and to make sure that you're seeing the consumer takeaway. And as we stated, we're gaining significant share in our beer business. We're gaining share in almost every sector of our Wine & Spirits business. Both of those were very positive within the quarter. And don't get confused or fuddled, if you will, by the lumpiness of the shipment timing because, last year, as we know, because of weather-related events, was a bit unusual. And so therefore, the overlaps in particular, quarters of this year will be a little different. I look at the depletions, and our depletions were very strong, yielding share-gaining performance within the market. More importantly, we are continuing to see strong consumer demand throughout the year. And certainly, the consumers continues to be interested with our business despite an understanding that there's -- it's going to be an interesting year relative to questions around inflation and around recession. But we remain very confident in the performance of our business, and I think it was reflected in the quarter we delivered. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So maybe we could just take a step back and talk about how you think your business is positioned if we do move into a recession and a period of weaker consumer spending both looking at past cycles and what you've seen so far this cycle. And second, maybe just an update on June depletions. Have you seen any trade down impact on your business so far? So maybe first conceptual and then be a bit more concrete. What are you seeing near term? Bill Newlands : Sure. well, let's deal with a few facts that I think are very strong and supportive of our business. We are finding that 7 out of 10 shoppers who purchased beer have that as a planned purchase before leaving their home. I think that's very strong. It speaks very well to our business. We then look at a thing like buy rate. And buy rate, the way we discuss buy rate is equal to the number of trips times the spend that occurs during the trip. And that's actually up versus pre-pandemic levels and is actually accelerating in Q1 for beer versus the prior 3 months. I think those are very strong indications of the strength of our portfolio, particularly when you look at the share gains that both Garth and I have alluded to up to this point. June looks consistent with our yearly algorithm. I think it was another very solid month, and it's consistent with what our expectations are for the year, as we've said it earlier. So just to recap. Modelo continues to be on fire. We're continuing to see strong results in Corona Extra. Once we get over the supply chain issues in Pacifico -- you saw a very, very strong quarter in Pacifico. So our anticipation is that we are going to continue to see a very solid year in our beer business as the year progresses, recognizing there's a lot of unknown variables that are going to go on relative to the economy. Operator : Your next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC. Unidentified Analyst : This is Philippe [indiscernible] on for Nik. Question on pricing, on beer pricing. You came in a little bit before expected and your 1% to 2% target for the full year. We are -- how are you thinking beer pricing will evolve in the balance of the year? And do you think the narrowing price gaps versus domestic beer could be a benefit, potentially accelerating your market share gains going forward as we get into a more uncertain macroeconomic environment? Bill Newlands : So our -- we've been very clear that our long-term algorithm on pricing is 1% to 2%. As you know, last year, we were slightly above that result. And frankly, we think that it is particularly important to keep the consumer in mind as we make choices around our pricing algorithm. Our current algorithm works very well for us. And it's fairly flexible. And the benefit of that approach is it does provide the flexibility as we watch and see how things develop over the course of the year. So what I can assure you of is we are closely monitoring what is going on both from an inflationary standpoint as well as pricing, and we'll be ready to adjust our approach if that proves to be necessary or appropriate. But what I would say is it's not going to change our long-term algorithm. We still believe that 1% to 2% over time is correct for our business and helps us maintain our consumer base, which ultimately, at the end of the day is what it's all about. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Just to start, Bill, just a clarification. You said that depletions are consistent with your yearly algorithm. Were you referring to the beer growth algorithm of 7 to 9 or the volume component within that algorithm? So that's just a clarification. And the main question is I hear you in response to the resilience of the consumer. I was wondering if you could just maybe frame consumer risk within your portfolio. For example, do you see relatively higher consumer sensitivity in Modelo versus Corona, given different demographic exposure? And maybe just offer some thoughts on how you could evolve your strategy, as you just noted, should you start to see a change in the consumer habits. Bill Newlands : Sure. So to answer the first question, it's both. Depletes and volume, we expect to be roughly equal over the course of the year. Because there is growth, shipments are always a little bit higher because you're working off a bigger base. So there's always a bit more shipment in any year because, unfortunately, we have a strong growth profile within our business. Premiumization rates, and I think this is an important one also relative to our portfolio, are continuing to hold. In fact, in beer, 59% of dollars are now in the high end. You remember just a few years ago, when we were predicting that we'd pass 50%. It's continued up to 59.5% as of this point in time, which is up 1 point -- 1.1 points versus prior year. You're also seeing similar activity in the wine business, where the premiumization that's occurring is continuing to occur there as well. All of those things speak very well to the sustainability of our growth profile for our business. And as we've said before, there's still plenty of room for growth within all of our franchises. But using Modelo as an example, Modelo is still growing substantially in a lot of secondary markets where there's a lot of distribution opportunity as well as gaining share in markets that have more sustained and long-term strength. So we're very comfortable that we have a long and sustained runway for growth across all of our brands, and certainly, the facts are backing that up. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. So I guess I'm trying a few different questions. From an industry volume standpoint, Bill, you've spoken very clearly to the strength of your brand momentum in your portfolio. But industry-wide in beer, I mean my understanding is there's historically a pretty strong correlation between gas prices and beer consumption. And so I think some of the industry data that's out there or anecdotal has been that there has been a deceleration in industry volume in recent weeks. So I was just curious if you could comment on that. If you guys are not seeing that, if you think something different, if you don't think there's a relationship with gas pricing. I'd be curious that broader industry perspective would be helpful because I have no doubt that within that, your brands are in a great spot. Bill Newlands : Certainly, it's something that we're all watching. One of the benefits that you've seen in at historical times of recession or recessionary style trends is alcohol beverage tends to be an affordable luxury, and therefore, it tends to continue to be consumed during that window of time. Let me give you an exact fact around beer-drinking households. It holds an essential status for many, many consumers. In fact, if you look at 172 edible categories, beer ranks 15, about -- and therefore, what it says is the consumer is consistently wanting to continue to participate in this category. That doesn't mean that there won't be short-term impacts because of gas prices and other inflationary pressures. But overall, it tends to be a category that is -- that is a stable for a lot of people, and that's probably particularly true for our Hispanic consumer base, which, as you know, we over-index with that consumer base. So I think it speaks pretty well to our position at least of being able to work our way through a recessionary environment pretty -- in a pretty healthy way. Operator : Your next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Nadine Sarwat : Two questions for me, if I may. The first, could you just help us understand exactly why the Q1 price mix was above that longer term 1 to 2 that you mentioned? Is that the phasing of pricing? Is there a mix component we're not taking into account or perhaps some distributors taking pricing? Color on that would be appreciated. And then my second question on Canopy Growth. I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks that you remain committed to that investment. But the company does continue to lose share in Canadian recreational cannabis, continues to face challenging -- challenges reaching profitability. U.S. scheduled legalization is looking increasingly less likely, at least in the short term. So could you maybe provide more color as to what gives you conviction that this business can meaningfully improve in the long term? Bill Newlands : Sure. Let me take the first part of that because you are correct. If you look at the data, it certainly shows that the pricing scenario at the moment is above the 1 to 2 algorithm. There's a number of things involved in that. One is it only reflects tracked channels. So that's a piece of it. It is partly mixed. As you see different sizes and different products and different subcategories within beer affecting it, you see different scenarios. It's partly retailers making choices about hitting specific price points, which, in some instances, will drive the percentage higher but doesn't reflect the change in our pricing strategy. As I said earlier, I think this all goes back to our algorithm being particularly important and particularly flexible in our ability to see what's happening in the market and adjust as necessary as part of it. But all of those elements weigh into what is certainly some higher pricing than what we have noted in our words. Garth Hankinson : Yes. And on the Canopy question, there's no doubt that over the past couple of years, Canopy has faced a number of headwinds. That being said, we remain very, very positive on the category and very optimistic for Canopy. The reason we feel that way, right, is that, number one, in Canada, we believe that the Canopy team, through its recent announced restructuring programs, have a renewed focus on driving the premium end of that business, which is profitable and that the team up there is on a path to profitability in the near term. In the U.S., we continue to see very good green shoots for the category in general in terms of consumer consumption. Whether you look at retail sales or you look at state-by-state tax income associated with cannabis sales, both are growing very, very quite nicely showing that the consumer is adopting the category. We also really like the approach that the Canopy team has taken in the U.S. If you look at some of the -- some of the options that Bill outlined in his prepared remarks, Canopy's position with Acreage and TerrAscend and Jetty and Wana have them very well positioned to take advantage of the U.S. market once it does open up and once legalization occurs. So that's why we remain -- that's why we continue to have conviction on the category. Operator : Our next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Rob Ottenstein : Great. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the pricing question. And that is if you can talk a little bit about your views about what appears to be happening based on channel checks, trade checks that retailers are essentially taking or increasing their margin given the much higher price increases for other brands and just the fact that distributors, right, have pressures in terms of their costs, and they're likely to want to see higher prices, so if you could talk maybe a little bit about that dynamic. And I think we all understand the long-term algorithm, why that makes sense, but these are extraordinary times. Bill Newlands : They are extraordinary times. And I think the one thing that's important, Robert, in extraordinary times is to remain balanced, sensible and not sort of get caught up in the world wind at the moment and doing things that what I would describe as anti consumer. So that's why we are, again, saying that we are going to be judicious as to how we look at this, balancing the understanding that there are a lot of pressures that our consumers and all consumers are under because of inflationary pressures in the market. You have seen some increase in pricing as one of the prior callers asked that is being taken either at the distributor level or at the retail level to hit specific price points, and it's being reflected. So we're trying to walk the delicate line of what's appropriate, what is -- what can we do to reflect and address the rising costs that we are all facing while keeping our consumer base. We think that's in the long-term interest not only of our company but for the category as well. And as I said, we are going to be very judicious, we are watching it very closely. And as I said earlier, not to repeat myself, but we do have a very flexible algorithm that allows us to address questions in real time, and I can assure you we keep our eye on it almost on a daily basis. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So as we all listen to what you said in terms of like how you exit consumption and depletions, it sounds as if you are -- you're still quite confident as you exit the quarter and enter the Q2, and correct me if I'm wrong on the beer side. So given you cast the guidance for the balance of the year, should we summarize and interpret that you're monitoring how volumes would flow through as you're shipping more than depletion and, at this point, you're helping wholesale that retailers take a larger share of the profits at this point? But if everything goes well in the summer, goes as expected, perhaps you could take pricing as you go into the fall, which is a typical pricing point, a pricing action point. And if you can comment on how you're going to balance because your low single-digit implied shipment volume for the balance of the year? Obviously, it [discouraged] investors. Is there anything we should be noting in terms of like the level of conservatives that you're assuming now? Or is that just a function of again, looking at how your typical consumer will behave, given higher oil prices? Bill Newlands : So let me try to -- hopefully, I'll answer most of those here as I try to answer it. First of all, let me go back to something that I said in my prepared remarks, which is, while it looks like we shipped a lot more than we depleted in the first quarter, that is purely because of the overlap of last year where there was weather events. And the absolute -- on the beer side, the ships and depletes in the absolute were roughly the same, and we expect that to remain over the course of the year. As Garth noted a little earlier, it is going to be a little lumpy because we had a time in the first quarter where we went against weather-related activities. We obviously, in the back half of the year went against times when we were rebuilding the inventories for last year. So it will just be a bit of a lumpy year. Relative to pricing, most of our pricing, as we look at how we do it, is roughly 60% in the first half and 40% in the second half. That's just the way it has worked consistently. So we do have pricing moments. And as you know, we look at it SKU by SKU, market by market. We don't do broad-based pricing answers if it is a very micro view of pricing and how we look at it. So again, that gives us the opportunity to see how the year is developing, what opportunities exist in the marketplace. And we look at that, as I said, on an ongoing basis. So we think that, that remains the best way for us to proceed. It's worked very well for our company over the course of time, and we think it's going to continue to serve us well going forward. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : So kind of the same questions that you've gotten on elasticity and market environment and that on beer but applied to why. Kind of any thoughts or what you're seeing or would expect to see kind of how this environment affects wine sales. And when I think of that -- I know there's as you said, affordable luxury but just wondering if you're seeing consumers go from $25 wine down to $20 wine or if there's a net benefit for the Woodbridge franchise, as more and more people are looking at popular price wine. Just didn't know if you were seeing that or expect to see that and how that would affect your outlook? Bill Newlands : Sure. You bet. So in wine, and I quoted the beer example earlier, in wine, the entry levels of the high end are, frankly, the most robust growth profiles, and that's sort of in that $11 to $25 range. That represents about 28% to 29% of total dollars. And that's also, interestingly enough, it's the exact same number, 1.1 points versus a year ago. I quoted the beer one was also 1.1 points a bit earlier, but that's also up 1.1 points. And of course, that's perfect for us because we've got brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi and Unshackled and various other brands that fit right into that price point. So therefore, it's not surprising that those brands are doing extraordinarily well. As I said earlier, our premium wine and our fine wine and craft spirits businesses had a very strong quarter with strong depletion growth of 8% and 16%, respectively. So we had a very strong start in wine. And certainly, the premiumization that you're seeing continues. It would be a different answer if we talked about mainstream wine where, frankly, it's been more challenged, even though we're very pleased that our Woodbridge brand is gaining share in a challenged subcategory. So overall, it's very similar in style to what I responded earlier in beer, and we're quite pleased that it is. Operator : We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bill for any further closing comments. Bill Newlands : Great. Thanks again. Thank you all for joining our call today. As you could hear, we're off to a very good start to the year. We delivered excellent operating performance, underpinned by strong business fundamentals which provides us with great momentum as we head into our key summer selling season. Consumer demand and takeaway especially for our beer brands, remains robust as I've stated before, and we're well positioned to achieve our targeted financial goals for the year. Overall, we've demonstrated again that we're committed to pursuing our strategic growth initiatives while returning value to our shareholders. In closing, I'd like to wish everyone in the United States, a happy fourth of July holiday weekend and hope your celebrations with your friends and family include some of our fantastic beer, wine and spirits products. Thanks again, everybody, and have a safe and healthy summer. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joseph Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Suarez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning all. And welcome to Constellation Brands second quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I am here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill in line with prior quarters, I\u2019d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now, here is Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Joe, and good morning all. Welcome to our second quarter call. I hope everyone had a good summer and enjoyed some of it with our great products. Before we get started today, I want to take this opportunity to say that our thoughts are with all those affected by Hurricane Ian. Thankfully, all Constellation employees living in Hurricane Ian\u2019s path are safe and accounted for. We are also fortunate to avoid any adverse impact to our operations in the area to this point and we continue to stay in contact with our local distributors, retailers and other partners to best support their needs in this difficult time. Additionally, thousands of people in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have been impacted by this natural disaster. So we are also supporting the American Red Cross with a significant contribution to help provide food, shelter and much needed assistance. We will also match employee contributions to the American Red Cross two-for-one as part of this effort and we hope it will provide at least some comfort to local residents as they work to recover and rebuild. I also want to remind everyone that we filed our proxy statement in connection with the Class B common stock reclassification a couple of weeks ago. We have called a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the reclassification next month on November 9th. At this point, we are unable to comment further or provide additional information on this topic during today\u2019s call beyond what is available in the proxy statement and our other filings with the SEC. All of these filings are available through our Investor Relations website and I urge anyone interested in the special meeting or the reclassification to review these documents. Now, as usual, I would like to start by emphasizing a few key takeaways from our latest results. First, consumer demand for our products remained strong. Consumer led premiumization trends continue across beverage alcohol giving further confidence in the resilience of premiumization as a fundamental driver of demand for our brands. Buy-rate, which captures both the number of trips a consumer makes and the amount they spend per trip increased in the second quarter for both high end beer and total wine categories in tracked channels and buy rate for Hispanic high end beer consumers, which is particularly relevant to our core beer portfolio is also proving resilient. More specific to our brands, our beer business posted depletion growth of nearly 9% that is more than 9 million additional cases for the quarter. And in our Wine & Spirits business, our Wine portfolio gained share and outperformed the entire Wine category in tracked channels, while our craft spirits brands outperformed the higher end segment of the Spirits category. Second, our beer business also continues to outperform the entire category. In the second quarter, our beer business remained the leading share gainer in U.S. tracked channels across the entire beer category and now accounts for 28% of the high end segment. Importantly, we believe our beer business remains well placed to continue to support the steady growth of our brands with inventories across the supply chain at historical norms and production continuing for our operating plans to meet volume expectations for the fiscal year and incremental capacity unlocked from our existing brewery operations in Mexico through optimization and productivity initiatives and the expansion of our breweries at Nava and Obergon, as well as the construction process of our new brewery in Veracruz are all advancing as planned, all of which has given us the confidence to increase the fiscal 2023 net sales and operating income growth guidance for our beer business and continued conviction in our medium-term topline growth and margin algorithm. Third, the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business continues to yield results. Over the past few years, this business has been evolving from a U.S. wholesaler business focused mainly on the mainstream segment to a global omnichannel competitor primarily focused on the higher end. And in our latest quarter, our largest premium wine brands Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino and our largest fine wine brand, The Prisoner Wine Company all delivered solid depletion growth. In our craft spirits portfolio, High West, Casa Noble and Mi CAMPO all achieved strong double-digit depletion growth. In addition, our International and DTC channels each delivered double-digit net sales growth year-over-year and we continue to gain share in three-tier ecommerce. Fourth, our capital allocation priorities remain firm, starting with our investment grade rating. We expect to remain investment grade including after funding the expected $1.5 billion cash payment for the Class B common stock reclassification, given the strong operating performance and cash generation of our business. Moving on to cash returns to shareholders, as of the end of the second quarter, we were over 97% toward meeting our $5 billion goal and we have now exceeded the share buybacks component of our goal by $300 million and upon payment of today\u2019s declared dividend, which we expect to take place next month, we will have fully achieved our goal ahead of our fiscal year-end deadline. Shifting to our third priority of reinvesting to support the growth of our beer business, as noted earlier, our capacity expansions and construction processes continue according to plan. And lastly, our M&A focus remains on small acquisitions to fill portfolio gaps, particularly in our Wine & Spirits business. This included most recently the investment in a minority stake in Archer Roose as part of our focus on Female Founders initiative, which is an accessible premium wine brand focused on offering consciously crafted wines to a new generation of legal drinking age wine drinkers. We are proud to say that five years into our focus on Female Founders initiative, we have fulfilled 76% of our commitment to invest $100 million to Female Founded and Female led startups in the beverage alcohol sector as part of our efforts to enhance social equity within the industry. Now let\u2019s move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer gaining 1.8 points across the entire category and 2.5 points in the high end segment in tracked channels. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of over 10% and was the number one share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category. It continues to strengthen its position as the number two beer brand in dollar sales and is the number one or two beer in 11 states, more than double the number of states from just three years ago. We continue to see further opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of Modelo Especial particularly given the resilience of premiumization trends and our relentless focus on striving to close the brand\u2019s distribution and awareness gaps. Corona Extra maintained its momentum with 6% depletion growth and as the number three share gainer in tracked channels. It remains the number one most loved beer brand with both general market and Hispanic consumers and our La Vida Mas Fina campaign has maintained the number one spot and aid awareness across the beer category. We continue to expect modest growth from Corona Extra supported by distribution gains within certain pockets of the U.S., where it is underrepresented and the brands appeal and growth potential with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers. Pacifico achieved depletion growth of over 37% and was a top 10 share gaining brand in track channels. We continue to see a fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as an emerging brand, particularly as the brand has significant distribution potential when compared to Modelo and even more so when compared to Corona Extra. Lastly, our Modelo Chelada brands posted depletion growth of more than 60% for the second quarter and Modelo Chelada, Lim\u00f3n y Sal was a top 15 share gaining brand in track channels. Modelo Chelada remains the number one brand family in the Chelada space and owns nearly 60% market share of the Chelada segment nationwide. However, awareness for Modelo Chelada is still relatively low compared to other flavor categories and we continue to expect significant growth as we invest in marketing to broaden the demographic appeal and in additional flavors and package configurations to unlock new consumption occasions for this product. All in, the strong demand for our brands in the second quarter supported a net sales increase of 15% for our beer business and this in turn drove a 25% uplift in operating income, which also benefited from the lapping of higher obsolescence charges last year. This gives us confidence to increase guidance for our beer business, as we now expect to achieve 8% to 10% net sales growth and 3% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal 2023, which Garth will review in more detail shortly. That said, it is important to remember that in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, we will be lapping elevated shipments from the second half of the last fiscal year that resulted from the rebuild of distributor and retailer inventories after supply shortages and severe weather-driven shipping disruptions that occurred in the first half of fiscal 2022. So while on an absolute basis, we continue to expect our shipments for the remainder of this fiscal year to be relatively in line with depletions, we believe the more comparable indicator for growth for our beer brands in the second half will be the depletion rate. Looking forward, we are also confident that over the medium-term, our beer business remains well positioned to deliver 7% to 9% net sales growth and 39% to 40% operating margin, supported by the sustained momentum of our core brands, the steady progress of our brewing capacity additions and the continued development of our innovation lineup, including the momentum of our Chelada brands, the recent launch of Fresca Mixed, the expansion of Modelo Oro from select test markets to the entire national market next year and the introduction of Corona non-alcoholic. The new non-alcoholic drinking age consumer is an attractive target as they also consume high end beer, as well as spirits and hard seltzers. So we are excited about the extension of Corona into this segment and we look forward to sharing more details as we approach the product launch. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business is making headway with its vision to become a bold and innovative high end market leader. As noted earlier, the largest premium and fine wine brands and craft spirits brands of our portfolio delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter and relative to the market, the higher end portion of our wine portfolio which includes our premium and fine wine brands outperformed the corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels. Our craft spirits portfolio delivered dollar sales grow significantly ahead of higher end segment of the Spirits category. Our Wine & Spirits business also continues to advance its mainstream strategy through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through the delivery of relevant and innovative products. As we also announced this morning, we continue to further premiumize our business with a divestiture of a portion of our mainstream wine portfolio combined with a couple of select premium brands to the Wine group. When it closes, we believe this transaction will further enable us to focus our portfolio and efforts to deliver the industry-leading growth and margins that we continue to work toward. From an innovation perspective, we have several great examples of recently introduced products that are driving growth within our Wine portfolio. Woodbridge Box was the number two Premium Box share gainer in the second quarter, Meiomi Red Blend 750 was the number two wine SKU, Kim Crawford Sparkling Prosecco was the number four new wine brand and the recent launches of The Prisoner PINOT NOIR and Blindfold Blanc de Noir are respectively seeing early successes in priority accounts and the on-premise. Beyond product innovation, we continue to extend our growth in direct-to-consumer and three-tier e-commerce channels, as well as International markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 15% in the second quarter, as our investments in these channels continue to yield strong performance. We also continue to outperform in three-tier e-commerce delivering dollar sales growth 16 points ahead of the competition in the second quarter. Importantly, we are also outperforming in three tier e-commerce with our beer business, which achieved a seven-point lead in dollar sales growth versus competition in the second quarter. Back to our Wine & Spirits business, International net sales grew 10% versus prior year showing the continued momentum of our brands in the select International markets that we are targeting, Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing our omnichannel and International footprint as we believe these channels will continue to grow as a portion of our mix over time and be an important opportunity for higher end growth. Now let\u2019s move on to Canopy growth. While the impairment of our Canopy investment is clearly disappointing, it is not indicative of the significant long-term market opportunity that still exists for the legal cannabis market, particularly in the U.S., where the market was estimated at $25 billion at the end of 2021 and is expected to nearly double in size by 2026 as more states continue to legalize cannabis. In fact, the companies that Canopy invested in to establish its U.S. ecosystem continued to perform strongly and to scale. We also remain supportive of Canopy\u2019s efforts to restructure its Canadian operations and its plan to further drive BioSteel\u2019s growth, and believe these actions will also strengthen their business and ultimately provide an opportunity to enhance the value of our holding. Before I conclude, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight that we expect to release our 2022 ESG Impact report later this month. The report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our ESG strategy and key initiatives designed to make a positive difference in our communities, safeguard our environment, and advocate for the responsible consumption of beverage alcohol. We will also for the first time be reporting with references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Framework and taking into consideration the recommendations from the task force on climate related financial disclosures. We believe these planned enhancements to our reporting will be valuable steps intended to better align with stakeholder expectations on the information we provide on these important topics reflect our company values and better showcase our ongoing efforts to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our communities, our consumers and our employees. I invite all of our stakeholders to spend some time reviewing the report when it is released, which will be available through our company website. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Number one, consumer demand for our higher end beer and higher end Wine & Spirits products continues to be strong and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of our portfolio and our runway for growth. Number two, our core imported brands continue to outperform the industry. Modelo Especial further strengthened its position as the number two beer in the U.S. market and continues to gain ground as the number one share gainer. And Corona Extra also maintained its momentum delivering solid growth rates and taking the number three share gainer spot in the beer catagory. The strong performance of our brands in the first half of fiscal year now puts us on track to deliver better than expected growth for our beer business in fiscal 2023. Number three, we continue to see the benefits of our Wine & Spirits strategy taking hold. Our largest higher end Wine & Spirits brands are delivering growth and we are also performing strongly internationally with our higher end brands and e-commerce and DTC channels. And number four, we continue to deliver on capital allocation priorities by maintaining our investment grade credit rating, delivering cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, advancing the brewery capacity expansion and construction processes in our beer business to support its continued strong growth and executing on disciplined tuck-in M&A to fill gaps in our portfolio. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our business continue to perform well in the second quarter, delivering another strong set of operating results. We are making good progress against our operating plan and strategic initiatives, and we are now expected to exceed our previously stated fiscal 2023 net sales goals for the beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and our operating income goal for the beer business. Our strong Q2 results were led by 12% increase in net sales driven by growth in both our beer and Wine & Spirits businesses. Additionally, we achieved a 10% uplift in operating income underpinned by significant double-digit increase in the operating income of our beer business. Our strong cash flow results supported dividends and incremental share repurchases in Q2 that put us on track to exceed our $5 billion goal in cash returns to our shareholders by the end of this fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 15% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 12% from strong demand for our core beer portfolio and higher average annual price increases. Q2 shipment volumes were generally aligned with depletion volumes and inventories across the supply chain remain at historical norms. From a growth perspective, depletions for the quarter were up nearly 9%, which was propelled by the continued strength of Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will continue to be flat in Q3. Moving on to beer margins, we continue to experience headwinds driven by the inflationary economic environment, particularly in packaging material cost and shifts in mix. However, beer operating margin increased over 330 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by more -- up by favorable impact from pricing, lower obsolescence charges and lower marketing spend, as well as the favorable impact of fixed cost absorption and strong shipment volume growth. As you may recall, we reported higher obsolescence charges in Q2 of fiscal 2022 due to the slowdown in the overall hard seltzer category during the summer of last year. Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points due to the timing of our media spend. We continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10% range for the full year, as we anticipating -- as we anticipate marketing spend to ramp up in the second half of the year with the launch of new campaigns particularly from our media investments around college and NFL football. Given the strong performance of our beer business, we are now targeting full year fiscal 2023 net sales growth of 8% to 10%, and operating income growth of 3% to 5% for that business. Our updated fiscal 2023 outlook includes a 2% to 3% price increase, which is higher than the previously anticipated 1% to 2% expectation and medium-term algorithm range, as elevated cost continue to create pressure across the supply chain. However, we continue to expect an implied operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal 2023. We anticipate second half operating income margins to be negatively affected as we expect the benefits from our pricing adjustments and cost saving actions will be more than offset by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges will continue to roll off, additional headcount and training, as well as increased depreciation from our brewery capacity expansions, and higher marketing spend as previously referenced. Now shifting to Wine & Spirits, Q2 fiscal 2023 net sales increased over 1% driven primarily by an increase in box sales and favorable pricing, and as Bill noted, Q2 depletion growth was solid for our largest premium wine brands Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino, our largest fine wine brand The Prisoner Wine Company and our largest craft spirits brand High West, Casa Noble and Mi CAMPO. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 19.3%, primarily driven by the continued impact of inflationary headwinds and higher general administrative expenses. The increase in COGS was mainly a result of higher supply chain costs, particularly container surcharges and warehousing, and higher material costs, including grapes and glass, partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of the lapping of the New Zealand frost and the wildfires in the U.S. The increase in general and administrative expense was driven by compensation and benefits primarily to improve marketing effectiveness. Marketing was favorable due to the time -- timing of spend. For full year fiscal 2023, we now expect Wine & Spirits net sales to come in flat to down 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5%. This implies operating margins of about 24% for fiscal 2023. Despite significant inflationary pressures and the inclusion of Cooper and Thief and the divestiture previously referenced by Bill, we continue to expect a considerable improvement in operating margins albeit at a lower point than previously anticipated. As noted in our Q1 earnings call, we expect to achieve the uplift in operating margins in the second half through the following key drivers; consumer led premiumization and mix improvement mainly in our fine wine brands; incremental pricing actions executed in Q2 that will be fully reflected in the second half; a bountiful New Zealand harvest, which will drive volume and enhance margins for Kim Crawford; lowering marketing as a percent of net sales; and finally, continued benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Now let\u2019s proceed with the rest of the P&L. As we also discussed in our Q1 earnings call, increased investment in our digital business acceleration initiative was the primary driver of our higher corporate expense. The majority of the spend in our Digital Business Acceleration Program or DBA for short was incurred in Q2 and we expect to start to see some small benefits from these investments later this fiscal year, followed by larger benefits in FY 2024. As a reminder, the goal of our DBA initiative is to support our aim to become a digital leader and capture value. It is a combination of data, technology and operating models, including evolving ways of working organizational structures and acquiring talent. DBA builds on the implementation of our SAP platform, it was completed last year and we anticipate it will enable us to deliver cost savings and greater efficiency in a number of areas by taking our digital strategy to the next level. The first phase of our DBA program is focused on three key areas, supply chain, marketing and procurement each with their own objectives. The aim of these initial efforts is to maximize efficiency across end-to-end supply chain, to build a world-class procurement function with greater spend visibility and to unlock demand for our products by analyzing and connecting multiple consumer data sources. We continue to expect $35 million to $40 million of spend in our DBA program for fiscal 2023 as part of our total $265 million to $270 million of corporate spend anticipated for the full year. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter was relatively unchanged. However, we now expect interest expense for fiscal 2023 to be between $360 million and $370 million as a result of the July equitization of the Canopy debt securities and rising interest rates. This excludes the impact of any interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration payable in the event the Class B common stock reclassification closes. From a balance sheet perspective, should the reclassification be approved on a Q2 FY 2023 pro forma basis, our net leverage would increase to approximately 3.5 times when considering funding for the premium payment and excluding Canopy equity earnings. We ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3 times excluding Canopy equity earnings. As Bill noted, we have nearly completed our goal of returning $5 billion to cash to shareholders. We will continue towards our goal through planned dividend payouts and opportunistic share buybacks throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. This remains a top capital allocation priority and we now expect to exceed our cash returns to shareholders goal by the end of this fiscal year. That said, we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $186.5 million for fiscal 2023 including shares repurchased in Q2. As a result of the adjustments to our beer business growth outlook for fiscal 2023 and the partial offset from higher interest expense, we now expect EPS comparable guidance to be in the $11.20 to $11.60 range, which represents a $0.10 increase the top end of our prior guidance range. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2023, which is a 4% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flow, partially offset by 23% increase in CapEx investments, as we continue to make good progress on our brewery capacity expansion plans to support the robust growth of our beer business. In addition, our brewery optimization and productivity initiatives have enabled us to utilize incremental capacity from our existing footprint. We now estimate our current total capacity to be approximately 41 million hectoliters, giving us additional production flexibility and enhancing the returns of our prior capital investments. We continue to expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and unchanged CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Lastly on Canopy growth, we recorded a $1.1 billion impairment on our investment, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. This non-cash item was driven by the following factors, the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy stock price recovery in the near-term, Canopy\u2019s previously announced goodwill impairment for their cannabis operations and the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis legalization. In addition, we also recorded a $651 million equity loss from our share of ownership in Canopy, which includes $461 million of Canopy\u2019s goodwill impairment. While disappointing, we continue to believe that Canopy\u2019s focus on premiumizing its cannabis branded portfolio to improve their performance in Canada is appropriate and we also remain supportive of Canopy\u2019s efforts in the U.S. to strengthen their emerging CPG brand distribution and build of a competitive THC ecosystem. In closing, we continue to deliver strong business performance and are proud of the continued progress we are making against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our beer business continues to outshine the market and our Wine & Spirits business is showing the benefits of its strategy to become a global omnichannel competitor in line with consumer preferences, primarily focused on the higher end. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So on the beer\u2026 Bill Newlands : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : \u2026business, there has been a pretty nice halo the last few quarters between scanner data and the reported depletions just as on-premise recovers post-COVID. It wasn\u2019t as much the case this quarter. So can you just give us some detail on on-premise and untracked channels in general in Q2 and what you are seeing there? And then on the beer margin side, obviously a big beat in the quarter versus consensus, that\u2019s great news, but the implied H2 margins of 36% are well below what you saw in the first half, obviously there is some seasonality there? But just help us understand as we think about margins for fiscal 2024. Should we think about it more relative to a 38% full year basis and more relative to 36% the back half, again there\u2019s some seasonality there, but just conceptually how you think about that would be helpful? Bill Newlands : So why don\u2019t -- Garth why don\u2019t I take the first part. So relative to the on-premise, it\u2019s very typical of us to see a stronger Q1 on-premise, because it includes Cinco, which is the single biggest event and occasion for our beer business in the on-premise. On-premise was roughly 11% of our volume in this particular quarter, which was slightly less than it was in the prior quarter. The other thing, I think, it\u2019s always important to look at is, our depletion volume, it has been very consistent with what we look at in IRI trends. And as an example, in our beer business in the most recent IRI trends, the 26-week data showed in totality 7.5% growth and purely the import business showed 9.4% growth. That\u2019s very consistent with our roughly 9% depletion growth in this particular quarter. The other place we will also see strength within our business is in some of the untracked channels in smaller Hispanic, particularly Hispanic accounts, particularly our West, which are not tracked by IRI or Nielsen channels. So, all in, I think, again our depletion growth profile looks exactly like what the take out trends in tracked channels are. And I think, as we have said many, many times, this year in particular that is really the way to look at our business due to the variance that we saw last year in weather-related activities in our and when we shipped and when we did maintenance and things of that nature, which I am sure Garth will touch on here in a moment. Garth Hankinson : Yeah. Dara, on the margin piece. So, one, I would say that, you would expect that this year\u2019s margin profile on a first half versus second half would reflect something if it\u2019s more normal, which we really haven\u2019t had the last couple of years due to sort of production issues that we had to contend with, which led to sort of a rebalancing of our shipments. Again, this will be more, because we are in a more typical production environment, you will see a more sort of normal first half versus second half margin profile. We are expecting margins in the second half to be negatively impacted as I said in my remarks as the benefits from pricing and some of the cost saving actions will be more than offset again by ongoing inflationary pressures. From a material\u2019s perspective, we continue to see some pressure from corn, as well as cans and cartons and glass. As you know, we have a relatively robust hedging policy. But the way that we layer in those hedges and then the way that those hedges then roll off, we saw the greatest impact from those in the first half of the year. So while we are nicely hedged, they just won\u2019t be at the favorable rates if you will, as we were in the first half. And then again as is typical -- and then it\u2019s typical as we are laying out incremental capacity, we will be impacted by incremental costs as we bring on people to train in advance of the capacity coming online. And then, finally, we are expecting to see a significant increase in marketing in the second half versus the first half as we support new marketing campaigns around college and NFL football. For FY 2024, our guidance is continues to be clear on that. We continues to view the right way to think about our margins is in that 39% to 40% range and we are not coming off of that. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, I wanted to pivot to the wine sale this morning, given the continued premiumization focus but you are holding onto Woodbridge, a more value-oriented brand, I think, the view there in the past has been that that brand offers scale. Just a little bit on how the deal came about, whether you can comment, whether you are done and generally pleased with the shape of the portfolio at the conclusion of this transaction? And I think, just kind of taking a step back, just given the change here, and I think, it\u2019s sort of been in some state of transition for a period of time, it sort of begs the broader question, whether the wine portfolio albeit a narrowed down one and more focused on premium -- the premium end of the category, whether you think it still makes sense within the broader portfolio relative to a beer business, much higher growth margins and return on capital. So I\u2019d love to get your thoughts there. Thanks so much. Bill Newlands : Sure. Look, we are very pleased with the progress that we are seeing in the Wine business and the divestiture that you saw this morning again it helps to reshape the portfolio. What I -- the way I think you should think about our total business is we are increasingly focused our attention on the higher end. We have noted that for many, many years as it relates to beer. We have now specifically related that on our Wine & Spirits business as well. As you probably noted, most of the tuck-in work that we have done in our Wine & Spirits business has been focused on craft spirits, as well as higher end wine brands that fill portfolio gaps, all of which focus on the high end, where we believe the growth and margin profile are significantly improved. So I would think about this today as just a further step in the reshaping of our business. As we have said, we are very focused on seeing a growth profile and an improved margin profile on that business, and we believe we are well on our way to delivering that and today is just again one more step in the process of achieving that goal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now live. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. I was just curious on the second half outlook because some of the things - just in terms of the cost structure because some of the things you have called out in terms of rolling hedges and so on. I would have thought, you might have had some visibility into previously. So I was just more curious on the, what\u2019s changed on the second half cost outlook rather than just why second half is different than first half? And then the second thing was, you made a pretty clear statement on the medium-term algorithm still looking for 39% to 40% margins on beer. So outside of the timing shifts that are impacting the second half margins, I was just curious if you can maybe look forward fiscal 2024 and beyond, like, do we get back to 39% to 40% in 2024 or is it a longer rebuild because of where you think that -- those relative hedge positions kind of roll through when we look into 2024? Garth Hankinson : Yeah. So, Lauren, on the first half of that around what changed from Q or from the first half of the year to the second half of the year, and I would say that, really nothing changed in our mind. We give guidance on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis, and we are going to deliver margins in line with where we said at the beginning of the year. Do you want to answer the second half, Bill? Bill Newlands : Yeah. Sure. I think the way that -- I think we will obviously give specific guidance on fiscal 2024 when we get to that timeframe. But I think, what we are seeing is, we continue to see a long runway for growth in our beer business and we think that\u2019s in the 7% to 9% range consistently. We think, we are going to see consistent delivery of 39% to 40% on the margin play. As Garth and I have always said, over the last several years, you have opportunities to be ahead or behind that in any one particular year. This year we are a little behind that algorithm because of a number of factors that we have touched on before. But we still believe that is a solid expectation for the medium-term and we will give specific guidance around 2024 when we get there. But we believe that\u2019s a consistent approach that we are going to be able to deliver on with consistency for the next several years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2026 Bill Newlands : Hey, Bonnie. Garth Hankinson : Hi, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : I was hoping for a little more color on your beer shipments versus depletions. I guess, first, it would be helpful to hear, how your quarter-to-date depletions have been tracking. And then second, you mentioned depletion should outpace shipments in the second half, but just really trying to think through how we should think about your shipment in the context of your new topline guidance, it does imply really any shipment growth in the second half. So, I guess, what I am really trying to understand is given you are lapping some of the brewery maintenance you had last year in Q3 and then you have the rollout of some really strong innovation such as Modelo Oro that will need to be shipped in Q4. So I am just kind of thinking through your new topline guidance and it feels pretty conservative. So I just want to make sure I understand that? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Well to answer your -- first part of your question, Bonnie. The start of the quarter, September was very solid and it\u2019s consistently in line with what we expect our annual numbers to be. So we certainly think we are off to a good start in the -- in Q3. Garth said this at the beginning of the year that it was going to be a very lumpy year. The important part that I think everyone should think about is, our depletion, the actual volume of our depletions and our shipments year-to-date are almost on top of one another. However, because you are comparing to last year and because we had shipping disruptions last year, it looks very different on a percentage basis. One an actual volumetric basis, they are very similar and you are going to see the same thing for the rest of the year. But this is why we have consistently said, the best thing to do to look at the success of our business is the depletion rate and our depletion rate year-to-date on our beer business is in just under 9%, and obviously, that\u2019s why we increased our guidance, because we have further confidence that we are going to outpace the growth profile that we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. So that\u2019s the way, we have consistently urged that people think about it around the depletion rate, because it\u2019s just going to be lumpy this year on the shipment side, doesn\u2019t take away one iota for the outperforming success that our beer business continues to have in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. So I just want to go back to this question, because it does imply though that, of course, you shipped more than you had in depletions in the 9%. So what you are seeing now, we should be seeing shipment volume negative in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, which is that\u2019s what\u2019s implying because we see it at flat revenues. If I understood it correctly, minus 2 to plus 2 giving your guidance and you have pricing. So you are just telling us to assume volumes will decline in the second half. I just want to clarify that. And then another question related to that, given the pressures that you had in commodities rolling over and all the hedges, isn\u2019t it make sense to take another pricing usually in the fall to kind of like offset those pressures? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yeah. Andrea, thanks for the question. So, first of all, just to reiterate with what you said, our shipments and our depletions for the first half of the year have been in line with one another, so we have not over shipped beyond the depletions. The issue between the first half and the second half is strictly due to the timing of shipments related to some production outages or we had to deal with last year. So that\u2019s the differential. As it relates to your point on pricing, as we said in our scripts, we are taking more pricing this year, we update for this year from our normal 1% to 2% algorithm to 2% to 3%. Bill Newlands : The other thing, I think, it\u2019s important to consider is, we have seen significant mixed benefits in our business as well. There\u2019s been a -- because in part from the growth of Cheladas, which are almost entirely single serve or we have added some innovation in different size and pack configurations, but the single-serve pieces of our business, have been very strong. It\u2019s a great example of that\u2019s mix accretive. So in addition to purely the fact that we are going to be taking a bit more price than we had originally anticipated, we also are seeing mixed benefits within the portfolio as well, which will be advantageous. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is now live. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what\u2019s going on with Modelo and Corona. Corona being somewhat stronger than we would have expected, Modelo still very strong, but slightly slower than it has been in prior years. Is there anything going on there in terms of the interaction between those two brands or the brand families that we should be aware of? Bill Newlands : No, Robert. I don\u2019t think so. I mean, again, when we look at the kind of growth profile that Modelo Especial using that as the example. In any of the volumetric trend timing, we are growing in double digits all the way along and that becomes, obviously, that the bigger it gets the more double digits is a very enjoyable proposition. We are very excited admittedly about Corona Extra. Corona Extra has grown a bit ahead of what we had expected. But I think that speaks to the just the long-term belief amongst both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers in that brand. It\u2019s the most loved brand. We continue to benefit from that. And we continue to advertise against that business very heavily. So I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into the fact that Modelo was continues to grow double-digit, but it\u2019s slightly less than the last double-digit. I would view it as we have a comprehensive brand portfolio whether you talk about Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, the Chelada business, Pacifico, that just continues to radically outperform and that in combination allowed us to raise our expectations for the beer business for the year. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you. Bill Newlands : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, guys. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : I just wanted to ask a question about, I guess, beer inventories and given that you have had more supply this year and it seems like you\u2019re in-stock levels are better in assortment. Has it just being more in-stock with your -- with a full array of assortment is that, how much of a benefit has that been to depletions? Bill Newlands : Well, obviously, any time you have all the packages and you have all the availability that you expect, it certainly is beneficial. What I must say is our team has did an outstanding job of making sure throughout the challenging time, when we had some product outages to make sure that we had availability of the brand. Brand size switching, meaning package size switching within the beer business is very strong, because most consumers come into the store planning to buy a Corona or a Modelo, and therefore, will adjust their package size selection based on what\u2019s available. We have seen that through in-depth consumer research. So, yes, it certainly helps some because it provides the wide array of selection that we own to consumers. But it doesn\u2019t change the algorithm radically, because as you have seen, we continue to show high single-digit volumetric and double-digit topline growth within the business, almost throughout the entire thing. The other thing that I would say though, where you do see some real change by availability is Pacifico. We have said a couple of quarters ago, we had some challenges around brown glass, which significantly impacted Pacifico, but didn\u2019t really change, in fact some of you on the call asked questions about that, are we concerned the Pacifico\u2019s growth profile is what it once was and it comes roaring back with 37% and the IRI data shows over 50% take out increases. So I think it shows and confirms what we had said to you on prior quarters is that Pacifico is a tremendous potential brand for us going forward and it is a great example to your question of in instances where you -- we have had some challenges on inventory, what can really happen in the strength of our inherent brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Kaumil, perhaps, your phone is on mute? Bill Newlands : Talk to us, Kaumil. Kaumil Gajrawala : I am sorry about that, guys. Bill Newlands : There you are. Garth Hankinson : Carry on. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can we talk a little bit about the price increases, you are looking for a little more pricing perhaps than you had expected for, are they in place, what\u2019s the magnitude? And then on price gaps, you gave pretty compelling reasons in previous quarters on why you are going up perhaps less than the market, given kind of our outlook for inflation, most of which has come through. So can you maybe talk about kind of this new outlook and what has changed? Bill Newlands : I think there\u2019s two or three things that fall into that equation. You are correct, we have raised our expectation from 1 to 2, 2 to 3. I think there\u2019s several things that are in play there. We have been very excited by the buy rates that we have seen across our business one. We obviously are doing our best to cover as best we can some of the inflationary pressures that Garth noted in his remarks. But we really haven\u2019t changed how we do pricing. We do our pricing, SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market, all the way across the Board. But it will probably come into that 2 to 3 range, which again is up from what we expected. I think, an important part and I touched on a couple of questions ago is, we are also seeing mixed benefits, which does flow through in terms of how it presents itself when you have things like single serves doing better, which is a better mix item for us, you see Chelada which are all almost all single serve being a better mix item for us. So you have got a combination of, yes, we are going to take a bit more pricing. Yes, you are seeing better mix in the overall equation and yet we are still doing it the way we are doing it, which is SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market. And I believe it\u2019s remains judicious, we always keep the consumer in mind as we think about what we are doing relative to pricing and that certainly isn\u2019t going to change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good morning. I want to touch on\u2026 Bill Newlands : Hi, Vivien. Vivien Azer : \u2026cannabis, Bill. Hi. I wanted to touch on your comment on safe banking. I mean, I fully agree rate like so hard to know, but in the base case assumption is that Republicans flip the house. It seems like there\u2019s maybe better than a 50% chance that they could pass. Historically cannabis indicated that the Constellation Board sensitivity in your lender sensitivity is the key determinant in terms of their ability to close their purchase obligation on acreage that would certainly be meaningfully accretive to their bottomline and in turn, how you guys are reporting that business. So could you just offer any updated insights on how the Board and your lenders are thinking about safe in the current kind of health version very narrow? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. We feel miserably of predicting how that was all going to play out. So I would take my answer with a slight grain of salt admittedly. But we are cautiously optimistic that that there will be progress. What I am particularly happy about relative to Canopy, as I think they are positioned to be a winner in the U.S. There want jetty and acreage layouts which are all ready to go. I think are an important part of being a winner. We still believe that in the longer run brands are going to matter and I think they are positioning themselves to have the right brands that will matter over the long run here in the U.S. But look, we are optimistic, I think, everybody\u2019s optimistic that we are going to start to see the legislation loosen up, although again being able to predict that, I would have feel miserably on that score, but we are hopeful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Your line is now live. Nadine Sarwat : Hi, guys. I\u2019d like to kick off with the two long-term questions here. So sticking on the Canopy\u2019s points in the past you have alluded to U.S. federal legalization has been one of the key factors behind your continued confidence in the Canopy investment, but it\u2019s now one of the stated reasons for the meaningful impairment you took today. So how long are you willing to wait to see U.S. legalization happen and do you see the size of your stake changing in Canopy anytime soon? And then, similarly, a bigger picture question, you are super premium beer brands continue to perform strongly in the last quarter, but the consumer is seeing increasing pressure on their wallets from macro pressures. So are you seeing anything if any changes in consumer behavior quarter-to-date from that macro pressure? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Well, I will take -- let me take the wallet question, then we can decide who takes the other. No, unfortunately, we have. One of the things that we recognize is beer fortunately is a staple for many of our -- much of our consumer base. So we have seen some variation in terms of the pack sizes that have been taken out. But as I alluded earlier and we view this is a critical component. The buy rates that we have seen have been increasing and that\u2019s one of the first things you look at is the number of times as people go to the store and when they take out when they are in the store. So, we are cautiously optimistic that this is going to continue to go well for us. I think it speaks to the strength of the brands and I think it speaks to the strength of the brand confidence that consumers have with us. Relative to cannabis, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to see the size of our investment in that change. Garth Hankinson : And as to outlook, I would just say that, in terms of the first part of your question around legalization. First of all, that was one part of a multi-part analysis to determine whether or not we need to take a -- to take the impairment that we announced today. Beyond that we continue, as Bill has said we continue to be pleased with how the cannabis category has unfolded. In the U.S. as Bill noted in his remarks, it\u2019s now a $25 billion retail sales opportunity in those states where it\u2019s legal. So it is starting to convert consumers, consumers are adopting to the category and we are happy with the position that Canopy has in the U.S. and with the improvements that they are making in Canada. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Just couple questions on mix, I mean, Modelo Oro, I can\u2019t remember, is that the shipments as you expand nationwide going to have an impact or a meaningful impact on the back half of the year kind of shipments or is that more into next year or is it did not meaningful. And then second and I know that I should probably understand this, but why isn\u2019t just coming out, it\u2019s Modelo Light. I mean it seems like with some of the confusion of Corona Premier that the consumer doesn\u2019t always understand that it\u2019s a light beer or it\u2019s a low-calorie beer. So any clarification would be helpful. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yeah. You bet. Oro is going to be taken nationwide next fiscal year. So it will have no impact per se in the back half of this current fiscal year. It\u2019s in three test markets now, and obviously, it will continue, but it will be taken nationwide next year. Look, we did a lot of study as to what we thought was the best answer. We -- if you actually look at the can that we are really talking about the gold standard of light beer. So I think the consumer will understand what they are going to get. Our understanding from the research is that they do understand what it is. And certainly, we were very pleased with the results of the test market and are anxiously looking forward to seeing how it does on a national basis next year. It was highly incremental and we are very excited about that as well. So we are very optimistic about what Oro can do when it -- when Modelo has a quote light version unquote. Operator : Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Newlands for any further closing comments. Bill Newlands : Thank you again and appreciate all of you joining our call today. Hopefully, as you could hear, we delivered another quarter of strong growth performance. Consumer demand for our higher end beer, Wine & Spirits brands remain robust, giving us further confidence in their runway for future growth. Our Core beer brands Modelo Especial and Corona Extra continue to out shine the market and our next wave brands like Pacifico and Modelo Chelada are achieving very strong double-digit growth. We continue to see opportunity ahead for our beer portfolio supported by continued consumer led premiumization and our ongoing investments in brewery capacity expansions. The benefits of our Wine & Spirits strategy are also taking hold, as our higher end brands continue to resonate with consumers and our global and omnichannel efforts are yielding benefits. Our largest premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits brands all delivered positive depletion growth and we achieved double-digit net sales growth in both DTC channels and International markets. And we continue to demonstrate again that we are committed to capital allocation priorities to maintain our strong financial foundation, balanced returns and reinvestment and deploy excess cash with discipline. In closing, as our next earnings call is not for January, I\u2019d like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. And as always, we hope your celebrations will include enjoying some of our great products with your family and friends. Thanks again, everybody. I appreciate you are joining the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joseph Suarez. Thank you. You may begin. Joseph Suarez : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, all, and Happy New Year. Welcome to Constellation Brands third quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here this morning with our CEO, Bill Newlands; and our CFO, Garth Hankinson. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters or like last, let me limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter call. I hope you all had a great holiday season and that our products were able to play a role in some of your special moments with your family and friends. Since our last call in October, Constellation Brands reached a notable milestone in its history as a public company. As most of you know, in November, our shareholders approved the elimination of our Class B common stock. With that came the transition of our company to a single class of publicly listed stock, our Class A common stock, which provides our shareholders with equal one share, one vote rights. I want to thank everyone who supported this important enhancement to our company's corporate governance profile and capital structure. We believe that our leadership team now has an even stronger foundation to continue to build shareholder value through the strategic initiatives we adopted and have steadily advanced over the past nearly four years since I assumed the role of CEO. Since fiscal 2020, we agreed to focus on and put in place plans to : number one, continue to build powerful brands that people love; number two, develop consumer-led innovations aligned with emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for growth; number three, deploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities; and number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world. I'm pleased to say that we continue to build on a strong track record we have established against all of these strategic initiatives. Starting with number one, building our powerful portfolio of brands. Our beer business, despite a more recent series of headwinds, which we'll address in a few minutes, delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of leading share gains across the entire U.S. beer category in IRI channels that was primarily driven by our two largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra. In the third quarter, Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and is the number one high-end beer brand, and Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the number three high-end beer brand. In fact, our beer business delivered 3.5 points of share gains and 54% in dollar sales growth when comparing the 52-week period that ended with our latest fiscal third quarter against the 52-week period that ended with our fiscal 2019. And comparing the same periods, the business contributed the highest dollar sales growth in the category, amounting to over $2.5 billion. In our Wine & Spirits business, our largest higher-end brands Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner and High West, all delivered dollar sales growth and share gains in the third quarter. And comparing the 52-week period that ended our latest fiscal third quarter, against the 52-week period that ended our fiscal 2019, these brands achieved 72% dollar sales growth. Moving on to number two, consumer-led innovation and shaping our portfolio for growth. Many of you may be surprised to know that in our beer portfolio, our SKUs introduced over the past three years have driven 20% of the growth delivered by the business since the start of fiscal 2020. An important part of this growth has come from our Modelo, Chelada brands, which have evolved from a niche business to a sizable platform. In fiscal 2023 year-to-date, it has delivered 13.6 million cases of depletions, which already exceeds the brand's total deflations for all of last fiscal year. And in the third quarter, Modelo Chelada Limon y Sal moved up nine spots to become the sixth largest share gaining brand in IRI tracked channels. Beyond the Chelada brands, we continue to build on the opportunities within the Modelo family with a clear focus on maintaining brand investments. We are excited about the national launch of Modelo Oro in March which has surpassed internal and external benchmarks in test markets. In our Wine & Spirits business, innovation has also yielded strong results, increasing its contribution to net sales from 1% in fiscal 2020 to approximately 8% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. This expansion has been primarily driven by extending our largest higher-end brand, once again, Meiomi Kim, The Prisoner and High West. Notably, extensions in The Prisoner brand family, Blindfold, SALDO and Unshackled have contributed significant growth, especially Unshackled, which has grown to be half the size of The Prisoner brand in just four years. In addition, since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we have added five brands through acquisitions, like Bronco Wines, My Favorite Neighbor, Empathy Wines, Halpern and Kings and Austin Cocktails, all of which are in the higher-end segments of the wines and spirits categories that are contributing to growth. And we divested 36 brands, the vast majority of which were in the mainstream segment, which has mainly been in decline due to consumer-led premiumization trends. Given this free shaping of our portfolio, including the recent additional divestiture 62% of net sales in fiscal '23 year-to-date were from our higher-end brands. This is a dramatic shift from the 34% higher-end brands represented at the end of fiscal '19. Now turning to number three, capital allocation. In fiscal 2020, we introduced a thoughtfully structured approach designed to consistently deploy capital with discipline and balance. We made maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, our top capital allocation priority and reduced our net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, from 4.5x at the end of fiscal '19 to 3x by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year. This was partly driven by a $3.2 billion reduction in our debt levels and partly by strong earnings growth in our beer business. And then in the third quarter, these efforts gave us the flexibility to both accommodate the $1.5 billion financing for the elimination of our Class B shares and to maintain our investment-grade rating. As our net leverage ratio remained in line with our prior 3.5x target. However, we recently updated that set target to 3x, given our ability to previously achieve that target and the continued strong cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. Our second priority became delivering cash returns to our shareholders, and we set a goal to return $5 billion in dividends and buybacks between fiscal 2020 and '23. We virtually completed that goal ahead of schedule in the third quarter and we're now on track to exceed the $5 billion target with the fourth quarter dividend payment announced today. As to our third priority, we sought to advance growing capacity expansions to support the strong growth in our beer business. Since the start of fiscal 2020, we added approximately 9 million hectoliters of capacity through growth investments and another 2 million hectoliters through brewery optimization and productivity initiatives. We are also on track to further diversify our production footprint with the development of our new brewery in Veracruz, where we have recently broken ground. And last in our capital allocation priorities was M&A, and since the start of fiscal '20, we have judiciously deployed excess cash through acquisitions with a strict focus on small gap filling higher-end brands. And the key strategic acquisitions we have executed over the last nearly four years are delivering top line growth. All in, we believe we have unquestionably upheld our capital allocation priorities and have even exceeded some of the associated targets we set out to achieve. Moving on to strategic initiative number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world by advancing ESG goals. Our ambitions are to protect the environment and natural resources by serving as a model for water stewardship in our industry while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to champion the professional development and advancement of women within our company, industry and communities, to enhance the economic development and prosperity in disadvantaged communities and to promote responsible beverage alcohol consumption. While we still have much work to do, I am proud to say we are making good progress towards our goals. To that end, in the third quarter, we released our 2022 ESG Impact Report, which included several enhancements on the information shared on these important topics and our work towards our targets, including, for the first time, references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and taking into consideration recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. So as with our capital allocation priorities, we have been consistently working to deliver against our strategic initiatives. Net, we have done we have said what we do, and we have done what we said. And despite current inflationary pressures and the risk of recessionary headwinds we remain confident in our ability to continue to advance and create value through these initiatives. And on that note, let's move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the third quarter. Depletion growth for our beer business decelerated to 5.7%, which, as I mentioned earlier, was largely due to a recent series of headwinds that developed towards the latter part of the quarter. First, as we shared on our last call, we decided to introduce all pricing changes above our usual algorithm due to cost pressures across the chain, and historically, the impact of these types of notable pricing actions take a few months to settle in. Second, distribution growth is returning to more normalized levels after lapping a softer summer period last year when we were managing supply constraints. That said, distribution growth remains at exceptionally healthy levels as well as aligned with our full year expectations. And third, some of these headwinds were particularly accentuated in a few key regions for our brands, such as California, where we lapped double-digit depletion growth rates and better weather in November of last year as well as more favorable economic conditions. All of that said, our beer business continues to perform strongly relative to the wider market and to resonate with consumers who continue to shift to higher-end brands. In IRI channels, we gained 1.5 points across the entire category and 2.3 points in the higher-end segment in the third quarter, which is higher, let me repeat that, which is higher than the share gains in the same quarter last fiscal year. And when looking at depletions fiscal '23 year-to-date, our beer business achieved growth of 7.8%, which continues to be in line with our annual expectations. Importantly, based on the prior activity we have seen in retail, as they adjust to the continued inflationary environment, we expect trends to return to more historical rates over the next few months. Now shifting to the performance of our beer brands. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of 4.4% in the third quarter lapping a tough 13.2% depletion growth comparison in the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. That said, the brand has achieved depletion growth of 9.9% over fiscal '23 year-to-date. In the recent quarter, it continued to strengthen its position in the five states where it is already the number one beer brand in dollar sales, delivering another approximately 0.2 points in share gains. Importantly, in the other 39 states tracked by IRI data, Modelo Especial delivered more than 4x the share gains at over 0.8 points. More broadly, Modelo Especial's depletion growth in its secondary markets outpaced the growth in its top five states by over 10 points. As such, we continue to see significant incremental opportunities to maintain the momentum of Modelo Especial, particularly through distribution gains in the states where it is under represented. Corona Extra delivered depletion growth of 1.3% in the third quarter and 4% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. As noted earlier, the brand has maintained its momentum as the number three share gainer in track channels. We continue to invest in the growth of Corona Extra through a thoughtful and authentic evolution of the brand's market such as the augmented reality addition to our O'Tannenpalm campaign, which is one of the more enduring holiday themed commercials running for over 30 years now. And we continue to see growth potential for Corona Extra with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers. Pacifico's depletion growth accelerated in the third quarter to 40.7%. And over fiscal '23, year-to-date, its depletion growth was 32.9%. The brand remains a top 10 share gainer in tracked channels in the third quarter, mainly supported by its growing footprint in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. We continue to see fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as one of our new wave brands with significant distribution potential relative to Modelo and even more so relative to Corona Extra. Particularly as the brand also continues to build momentum by shifting East in the U.S., building on the 26% depletion growth delivered in our Eastern business unit in the third quarter. Lastly, our Modelo Chelada brands achieved depletion growth of 44% in the third quarter and 48% over fiscal '23 year-to-date. Our Modelo Chelada brand remained the number one set in the Chelada space, and the brands gained nearly half a share point across all U.S. beer and track channels. For perspective, that is as much as Corona Extra's gain. In fact, these gains were largely driven by innovations launched this fiscal year, including Naranja Picosa flavor, the Limon y Sal 12 ounce 12 pack, which is a top 10 new packaged SKU and our new variety pack, which is among the top 15 new brands. We continue to expect significant growth from the Modelo Chelada brands as we invest in marketing to the general market consumer to broaden the demographic appeal for this product. All in, the strong demand for our brands in the third quarter supported a net sales increase of approximately 8% for our beer business. And despite the impact of inflationary headwinds on operating income, we were able to maintain operating margin at 37.5%. This gives us the confidence to once again raise guidance for our beer business this fiscal year lifting the low end of our growth outlook. We now expect to achieve 9% to 10% net sales growth and 4% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal '23. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business continues to advance its vision to be the high-end market leader. As noted earlier, our largest higher-end brands delivered strong performance relative to their categories in the third quarter. In our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, over the third quarter in track channels, The Prisoner brands grew dollar sales by 4.3%, while the fine wine segment contracted by 5.7%. And High West grew dollar sales by 22%, while high-end spirits segment grew by only 3.4% In our premium and mainstream Wine & Spirits portfolio, which we refer to as Ignite, both Meiomi and Kim Crawford gained share in the U.S. wine category. Depletions for our Wine & Spirits business declined by 5.5% in the third quarter, mainly driven by continued headwinds based across our mainstream brands. However, our Aspira portfolio delivered strong performance with 8.5% depletion growth in the quarter. And in fiscal '23 year-to-date, our Aspira portfolio has now achieved an overall 6.3% increase in depletions supported by strong double-digit depletion growth for The Prisoner and High West. Among Ignite brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford have also delivered solid depletion growth in fiscal '23 year-to-date, supporting an overall 2.3% increase in depletions for our premium line portfolio. Our Wine & Spirits business also continued to expand its global omnichannel footprint, advancing its growth in direct-to-consumer, 3-tier e-commerce channels as well as international markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 23% in the third quarter, and we continue to perform particularly well in 3-tier e-commerce which delivered dollar sales growth 9 points above the competition. These results were underpinned by our strategic DTC investments in both hospitality through facility upgrades and talent development and our own e-commerce website platforms as well as our continued leadership in 3 Tier e-commerce through marketing innovations like launching video ads on Instacart. And a strategic focus on major omnichannel national accounts, third-party marketplaces and digitally native retailers like Amazon, where we were the number one overall supplier and number one growth supplier in higher-end wine in the third quarter. International markets accounted for 9% of the total net sales in the Wine & Spirits business in the third quarter as our strategically focused approach continued to target select metropolitan markets, including London, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney, Mexico City, Zurich and Toronto with some of our most renowned premium and fine wine brands like The Prisoner, the Schrader as well as more recently acquired brands like Lingua Franca and My Favorite Neighbor. And with our craft spirits portfolio, which includes brands like Casa Noble and the CAMPO high-end tequilas, that delivered international shipments 5x greater than the third quarter of the prior year. We are also pleased that our efforts to establish a leading global higher-end Wine & Spirits portfolio are gaining recognition with several of our brands receiving remarkable accolades including Schrader Cellars winning its 37th 100-point score and its Double Diamond brand being recognized by The Wine Spectator as its number one wine of 2022. Our To Kalon Vineyard was being recognized again as the top vineyard in North America for the fourth consecutive year among top vineyards in the world. And I'm pleased to report that our To Kalon Vineyard has now also is certified as organic, expanding the appeal of its wines to a broader set of consumers and adding to its differentiation. And in our spirits portfolio, our recently launched Nelson Brothers Bourbon Reserve was ranked among Whiskey Advocate's top 10 most exciting whiskeys of 2022. So all in, our Wine & Spirits business continues to make meaningful progress on its transformation. And while net sales and operating margins, net of recent divestiture, were slightly lower relative to the third quarter of last fiscal year due to volume shifts from shipment timing only being partially offset by mix and pricing benefits we did see a significant sequential uplift in operating margins of 55 basis points relative to the second quarter of this fiscal year. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance for our Wine & Spirits business of stable to 2% lower net sales and 3% to 5% operating income growth, which we are providing against the fiscal '22 baseline adjusted for the recent divestiture. Looking further ahead, we are also confident that over the medium term, both our beer business and our Wine & Spirits business remain well placed to deliver strong growth and best-in-class operating margins. That said, given continued inflationary pressures and the potential impact of recessionary environment, we remain mindful of balancing the momentum of our brands against near-term cost challenges. To that end, based on our current expectations of the pressures that the consumer will continue to face in the near term, we are giving even more careful consideration to our pricing actions for fiscal '24. In particular, we currently expect pricing actions for our beer business to be more muted in fiscal '24 as our pricing actions in the current fiscal year were ultimately above our medium-term algorithm. While input costs remain at historically elevated prices we strongly believe that additional consideration in our approach to pricing in fiscal '24 is warranted to sustain healthy growth for our brands. In addition, while some input costs are below the peaks from earlier this fiscal year, we now anticipate inflation to remain above historical trends in the high-end single-digit range for fiscal '24. As always, we will continue with our disciplined approach to manage these evolving conditions through cost-saving initiatives. But these persistent inflationary headwinds will be compounding on the double-digit cost uplift we have faced in fiscal '23. As such, we now expect operating margins for our beer business in fiscal '24 to be more in line with our anticipated margin structure for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated 39% to 40% medium-term range. We are still refining our outlook for '24 and will provide more detailed guidance at our next earnings call, but we wanted to share some context today now that our annual planning process is underway. With all that said, let me be clear. Our beer business continues to have best-in-class operating margins and our Wine & Spirits business continues to make progress toward achieving that same differentiation. We are also confident that over the medium term, our beer business remains well positioned to deliver leading operating margins, supported by the sustained momentum of our core Modelo Especial and Corona Extra brands, the significant opportunity being captured by our Pacifico, Modelo Chelada brands. The incremental upside from our broader existing portfolio and the continued development of our innovation lineup particularly from exciting imminent additions like Modelo Oro and we continue to expect our Wine & Spirits business to make progress on its operating margins supported by continuing to pursue the exciting runway for growth of our higher-end brands and ensuring these brands represent an even greater portion of our mix over time, enhancing the performance of our mainstream portfolio through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through relevant and innovative products and growing our omni-channel and international leadership particularly as an incremental opportunity for higher-end growth. Now before I conclude, I wish to quickly touch on Canopy. We remain supporter of Canopy sellers to create an exchangeable share structure designed to support the consolidation of all its U.S. cannabis assets into a single avenue. And to that end, our intention continues to be to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy Growth into new exchangeable shares once its shareholders approve this transaction. We believe that the conversion of our ownership interest will maintain our ability to realize the potential upside of our investment in Canopy. At the same time this transaction and the surrender of our warrants are expected to eliminate the impact to our equity and earnings, mitigate risk to our organization and further reinforce our intent to not deploy additional investment in Canopy in line with our capital allocation priorities. In closing, I'd like to reiterate three main takeaways today. First, nearly four years ago we committed to a series of strategic initiatives aimed at delivering profitable growth and shareholder value. And I'm pleased to say that we are delivering against those initiatives and in many cases even exceeding the goals we set out to achieve. Second, our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute against these strategic initiatives and that our company remains in a strong position to deliver best-in-class results. Despite the headwinds in the quarter due to macroeconomic pressures and tough comps versus prior year, the strong performance of our beer business has put it on track to deliver better-than-expected results in fiscal '23. And the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business is also yielding results. And third, we remain confident we will continue to build on our track record of solid growth and value creation through our strategic initiatives. And with that, I turn the call over to Garth. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered another set of solid results in the third quarter and continue to make progress against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our beer business achieved high single-digit net sales growth and continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins. Our Wine & Spirits business made additional progress against its strategy with an even more premiumized portfolio further aligned with consumer trends following our recently completed divestiture. Additionally, we generated strong cash flow results and with yesterday's declared dividend to be paid in February, we are on track to exceed our stated $5 billion goal of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases between fiscal '20 and fiscal '23. I will now review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with our beer business. Net sales increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average price increases and solid demand across our portfolio. Q3 shipment volumes were up 3% reflecting a difficult volume lap given the focus of replenishing product inventories in the same period last year. From a depletions perspective, we achieved growth in the quarter of approximately 6%, driven by the demand of our Modelo family of products, including the Modelo Especial and Modelo Chelada brand as well as double-digit growth from Pacifico. As Bill noted, depletions decelerated sequentially from Q2 to Q3. This was primarily due to : number one, incremental fall pricing that, as expected, will put us above our targeted annual average increase. Notably the impact of our fall increases has been heightened by additional pricing actions across the value chain. That said, we expect the impact of incremental pricing will settle over the coming months as we have seen in prior similar circumstances. Number two, relatively lower distribution growth in Q3 versus Q2, where we lapped a softer prior year period when we were managing supply constraints. And while we are seeing distribution growth return to normalized levels, it remains aligned with our full year expectations. Importantly, it is worth noting that Q3 distribution growth remained well above the levels we achieved in Q4 last year and Q1 of this year. And number three, as Bill also referenced in the third quarter, particularly in the month of November, we lapped multiple tailwinds from last year such as double-digit depletion growth rates in key regions like California, which benefited from periods of warmer weather and a stronger macroeconomic environment. All of that said, we expect depletion trends to continue to normalize as we move into fiscal 2024, and we remain confident in our fiscal year expectations. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year, but please note that in Q4, there will be one less selling day. Operating income for the beer business decreased 2% and operating margins declined by 380 basis points to 38%. As expected, operating income and operating margins were negatively affected by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges rolled off. Increased logistics expenses related to higher fuel and freight costs, incremental operating costs and increased depreciation as a result of our brewery capacity expansions, and increased marketing spend, particularly from our media investments in sports sponsorships with NFL, NCAA Football, Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 160 basis points to 9.6% in Q3. For fiscal '23, we continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10%. More broadly, given the strong top line growth of our beer business year-to-date, we now anticipate it will grow net sales between 9% to 10% and operating income between 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. This still implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal 2023. As expected benefits from our 2% to 3% average pricing increase for the full year and our cost-saving efforts will be more than offset by the same headwinds that have affected our margins year-to-date. I'd like to take a moment to reiterate some of the points Bill made earlier regarding fiscal '24. As mentioned, we are anticipating our beer business margins to be more in line with our anticipated margin for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated medium-term target range of 39% to 40%. This is driven by the fact that input costs remain at historically elevated levels due to ongoing inflationary pressures. As we have shared in some of our prior calls, we hedged about 10% of our beer business costs to help reduce volatility in the P&L. However, our commodity hedging program is managed on a multiyear rolling basis. So we currently do not anticipate our blended hedge rates to capture the favorability of recent declines in certain commodity prices until the second half of next fiscal year. In addition while prices have declined from their peaks earlier this year for commodities like aluminum and natural gas, which are part of our can and glass cost, they still remain above pre-pandemic levels. Beyond our hedging program, most of our beer business input costs have a greater exposure to inflationary pressures, including raw materials, such as wood pallets, steel crowns and cartons. The majority of these input costs are subject to contractual agreements that tend to reflect negotiated prices that are based on existing inflationary conditions. So as we move forward with our annual planning and supplier cost determination process, we will develop a clearer view of these contractual prices and on the resulting margin expectations. Against that backdrop, with these processes now underway, we have greater visibility into the high single-digit cost segments that will continue to build off the double digit unfavorable cost outlook that our beer business faced in fiscal '23. In addition, we continue to see ongoing macroeconomic pressures on the consumer, which are leading us to plan to take more subdued pricing actions across our beer portfolio in fiscal '24. That said, we expect a number of tailwinds that will partially offset some of these headwinds, including the continued momentum of our core brands, capitalizing on opportunities with emerging brands such as Pacifico and Modelo Chelada's, winning with new and future innovation such as Modelo or Modelo Oro and through our consistent and disciplined cost savings actions, nevertheless, as Bill mentioned, we will continue to refine our outlook for next year, and we will provide detailed guidance during our Q4 earnings call. That said, it is important to reiterate that our expected fiscal '23 and fiscal '24 operating margins remained best in class. And in fact, when considering our fiscal '20 through our currently anticipated fiscal '24 margins, we expect the average operating margin for that 5-year period to remain within our medium-term algorithm of 39% to 40%. Now shifting to Wine & Spirits. As a reminder, during our recently concluded third quarter, we divested a series of brands from our Wine portfolio. As such, third quarter of fiscal '22, included approximately $17 million of net sales and $11 million of gross profit less marketing, that are no longer part of the Wine & Spirits segment results. When presenting today's results, I will be discussing our top line results on an organic basis, excluding the contribution from those divested brands in the preceding periods. Starting with organic net sales. The Wine & Spirits business decreased 1%, primarily driven by a 13% decrease in shipments, partially offset by a favorable product mix, which both related to consumer-led premiumization and mix improvements of our portfolio. From a depletions perspective, while the Wine & Spirits business saw a decline of approximately 6% on an organic basis in Q3 as Bill noted earlier, our higher-end brand delivered strong performance with our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, delivering depletion growth of 9%, driven by growth in our Prisoner Wine and High West brands. Meanwhile, our Ignite portfolio, which includes our mainstream and premium Wine & Spirits brands primarily faced headwinds from our mainstream brands, which was down 8%. That said, in tracked channels, our largest higher-end brands continue to outperform their corresponding segments, and our peak premium brands portfolio actually gained share in the category with particularly strong performance from Meiomi and Kim Crawford in both volume and dollar sales growth. Moving on to Wine & Spirits operating income and operating margins. Wine & Spirits operating income declined by 7%, partly as a result of the divestiture and operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 24.8%. The decrease in operating margins was driven by higher transportation costs, including ocean freight shipping, unfavorable costs from higher drivers largely due to inflation and increased general and administrative expenses due to higher compensation and benefits primarily related to higher headcount from our continued strategic focus on expanding into direct-to-consumer channels and higher-end brands in our Aspira portfolio. For full year fiscal '23, we remain confident in our previously stated outlook for our Wine & Spirits business. We expect fiscal '23 organic net sales decline of 0% to 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5% implying a full year operating margin of about 24%. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we expect our Wine & Spirits business to continue to make progress on its operating margin. We believe our Wine & Spirits business is positioned to further improve its operating margins through growth of our higher-end brands, bolster performance from our mainstream portfolio through high-return brand initiatives such as innovation, and expansion of our omnichannel and international footprint. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently working through our annual planning process and we'll provide a more detailed fiscal '24 outlook during our Q4 earnings call. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in at approximately $75 million, up 70% versus Q3 last year. This increase in corporate expense was primarily impacted by costs associated with increased compensation and benefits, primarily related to a third quarter fiscal '22 reversal of stock-based compensation and third-party services related to our ongoing investments in our digital business acceleration initiative. We now expect our total corporate spend to be between $290 million and $300 million for the full year, mainly driven by the incremental costs in Q3. Interest expense for the quarter was up 12%. Also, as we noted in our release, following the completion of the reclassification of our Class B common stock, we now expect interest expense for fiscal '23 to be between $390 million and $400 million. This includes the interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration which is expected to be $80 million to $90 million on an annual basis based on current market rates. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, came in at 18.8% versus 14% in Q3 last year. The effective tax rate increased mostly due to the change in stock-based compensation benefits. As a result of these updates to our outlook, the increased interest expense due to the reclassification bonds, adjustments relating to our most recent divestiture in our Wine & Spirits business and increased corporate expenses that were only partially offset by the increased expectations for our beer business. We now expect comparable EPS guidance to be in the $11 to $11.20 range, which represents a $0.20 decrease to the bottom end and a $0.40 decrease at the top end of our prior guidance range. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the nine months of fiscal '23 reflecting strong operating cash flow partially offset by a 14% increase in CapEx investments as we continue to support the growth of our beer business through our brewery capacity expansion plans. And on that note, to echo Bill, we are excited by the progress we have made with our new sites in Veracruz in which we recently broke ground. Our fiscal '23 free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion and CapEx is now expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow for fiscal '23 remains unchanged and is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion. Related to our uses of these cash flows, as we recently noted in December, our capital allocation priorities moving forward following the reclassification remain fundamentally aligned with the priorities we introduced in fiscal '20. To achieve a disciplined and balanced and thoughtful approach to support growth and value creation. Our recently updated capital allocation priorities are as follows : first, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and to targeting dividend growth in line with earnings as key elements of a disciplined financial foundation. We ended the third quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x when factoring in the financing for the cash payment associated with our recent transition to a single-class stock structure and excluding Canopy equity earnings. That said, we have set a target net leverage ratio on that same basis of approximately 3x, which we are confident we can return to. Another important element of our commitment to a disciplined financial foundation is targeting an approximately 30% dividend and payout ratio. Second, we will continue to balance investments to support the growth of our business and deliver additional returns to shareholders through share repurchases. As we look ahead, we continue to expect adding another 25 million hectoliters to 30 million hectoliters of brewing capacity between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This will be supported by $5 billion to $5.5 billion of investment over that same period. We are developing this capacity through a series of expansion waves which is consistent with the modular approach we have adopted to maintain capital expenditure discipline and flexibility. We remain committed to executing share repurchases targeted to at least cover dilution. While we also have approximately $1.2 billion of our repurchase capacity still under our current board authorization and plan to remain opportunistic, particularly since we achieved incremental cash flow flexibility. And third, we may deploy excess cash to smaller acquisitions. Again, we intend to remain disciplined in our pursuit of any M&A opportunities and we'll continue to pursue transactions that we believe fulfill one or more of the following characteristics : are consumer led, they deliver growth momentum, providing compelling returns, fill portfolio gaps, and offer synergistic benefits. Lastly, on Canopy. As it announced in October, Canopy plans to consolidate all of its U.S. cannabis assets into a single entity, Canopy USA. This U.S. holding company and new exchangeable share structure is designed to enable Canopy USA to trigger full ownership of Canopy's U.S. cannabis investments and capitalize on the U.S. cannabis market opportunities. Assuming the completion of this transaction and approval by Canopy shareholders of a charter amendment we intend to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy into new exchangeable shares, which is intended to protect Constellation shareholder value while retaining an interest in Canopy through nonvoting and nonparticipating shares. This share ownership transition and the surrender of our Canopy warrants is aligned with our focus on core beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and capital allocation priorities. As a reminder, until this transaction is completed and we convert our holdings into exchangeable shares, Canopy will still be reported within our P&L consistent with past quarters. In closing, we continue to demonstrate strong execution in growing our core business and investments to enhance our portfolio of industry-leading brands. As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we remain committed to delivering against our stated goals to drive sustainable and profitable growth and build shareholder value. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. When you walk through the drivers of the change in trend for depletions that you saw towards the end of the quarter, one sort of mention was a comparison on macroeconomic trend versus the prior year and then also your comments on taking sort of more muted pricing as you look into '24. So I'd love if you could just spend a little bit more time talking about what you're seeing from your various kind of core consumer groups, it feels like I know you pointed out some share gain continues. But when we look at some of your brands relative to other high-end brands, core beer brands, not Seltzer, it does look like there's underperformance, it's specific to your brands. So just any further diagnostic you may have done would be really helpful to hear about? And then also, I wasn't entirely clear on why the slower CapEx spend, I know you just went through it across at the very end of your comments, but I was hoping you could just reframe that because I admittedly missed why is it $200 million lower this year? Bill Newlands : Sure. So relative, Lauren, to the depletion trend scenario, we're still seeing in our -- all of our assessment and research suggests that we continue to have very strong support for our brands among our core Hispanic base as well as growing trends amongst the non-Hispanic community. I think a great example of that shows itself in that we actually had an increase in our share gain quarter-on-quarter from last year which reflects very well. Certainly, some of what we saw at the latter part of this quarter was driven by a couple of things. One is many businesses, including ours, took additional pricing over what we had planned. And that caused an overall softness in the market, particularly in the state of California. It wasn't limited to us. And frankly, that's not an unusual reaction. We've seen that many times before. Frankly, what we were very pleased about as we then look into December and to see if this thing is beginning to go back to some normalcy, we see that it has been, we saw a 7.5% swing to the upside in dollars versus where it was in November and that compares to a category swing of 4.5%. So again, we saw a significant improvement in the market that was primarily the cause of a bit of deceleration in our depletion performance as we got into December, and we continue to gain share in that overall mix of swing. So we're not -- we -- this is not an unusual event. It happens virtually every time you see significant pricing action taken and the fact that we continue to gain share at the clip that we are gives us great confidence going forward and the strength of the brands overall. Garth, anything you want to say. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Lauren, just on the CapEx, it's important to note that we continue to progress with our expansion as planned. As we stated in the remarks, we've added 11 million hectoliters of capacity over the last several years, $9 million in growth, sort of $2 million through productivity initiatives. We are on track with our expansions at both Nava and Obregon. And as we mentioned, we've recently broken ground in Veracruz. So the reduction in CapEx for this year is not necessarily abnormal as we move through the year. It really has more to reflect the timing of when payments will be made and less to do with progress. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, good morning, everyone. Bill, I was hoping maybe you could talk about what's actually happening with some of the pricing as it goes through the supply chain? Certainly, we've picked up some commentary within the trade that pricing was taken on top of what you actually took in the market. And I'm just curious what the state of that is, if it's starting to get unwound? And have you seen any implication of that in some of the more recent weeks? Bill Newlands : Yes. You bet, Nik. You're absolutely right. One of the things that we saw that occurred after our pricing increase is that other players within the chain took more price on top of what our pricing increase was. And frankly, this often happens as well. The Board tends to happen, and we've already started to see it in certain some markets is that, that moderates over time as well because an attempt is made to see what the consumer is ready to accept. And if we find a spot that's a bit more than they are ready to accept you see some moderation in that increase. You've already started to see that with some critical change in the state of California, which probably relates to my answer to Lauren a moment ago, which is why you saw the trends in December change quite a bit. So you're correct there was a lot more and it piled on, if you will, once it was out of us and into further down the chain, more was taken and as we often see that goes higher early and then moderates over time. Operator : Our next question is from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Nadine Sarwat : I just want to stick with depletions here. I know you gave those explanations in your prepared remarks, but I have two follow-ups. So the first is that the reported depletion still meaningfully lag the trends in the Nielsen track channels, which I would have assumed would reflect a number of the factors that you called out, so could you help us understand this gap? And then the second question is, I know you've mentioned that you have confidence that your depletions would return to those normal levels. But we are still seeing weakness in the December Nielsen trends. So could you provide some color as to what gives you that confidence? And what are your quarter-to-date depletions at the moment? Bill Newlands : Sure. So let's start with the question of track channels. One of the things that we have historically found is that you're in the roughly -- there's roughly 3-point delta, we use IRI, I realize you just said Nielsen, we use IRI. There's roughly a 3-point delta historically between the growth that you see in the tracked channels and the depletion rates. Interestingly, that got massively bigger when you're in the middle of the pandemic because the percentage of business that went through the off-premise trade increased substantially. That has now come back to somewhat of a more normalized level as you get to a little bit better positioned in the on-premise, not quite back to where it was, but it's directionally. So that is some of what you are seeing is you're back to a more traditional split between those individual things. Relative to -- and I quoted to the California, some other states are seeing a bit different. Texas on the other was also a market that was somewhat softer post price increase, and that one has not rebounded just yet. But that, again, is not unusual either. It's a little bit of a different channel mix than what you see in the state of California where you often see a more faster response to whatever impact pricing increases take. So this, in our judgment is all part of a normal process of when pricing actions are taken. It takes a few months for it to all work its way through the system. Relative to the depletes, we don't have the final numbers in. As you would expect, we're only in day five of the New Year and obviously, it included the New Year, which makes the reporting a little bit behind. What I would say is that we're comfortable with where we think the summer is going to land. Otherwise, we wouldn't have raised our guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, guys. Not to belabor the pricing conversation, but when you mentioned 2024 pricing to be more muted, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what that means? And then Garth, when we think about the share price, not just the movement today but perhaps more recently and perhaps even the fact that it's been -- the share has been flat for a period of time. Does that change how you're thinking about share recalls? Bill Newlands : Sure, I'll go for it. So relative to 2024 pricing, as we stated in the last quarterly call, we were going to go above what our expectations had been. And that reflects, obviously, in the October increase that has taken us above our traditional 1% to 2% guidelines. What we're suggesting relative to 2024 is that it's going to be much more in line with what our historical trend has been, which is 1% to 2%. We would not expect it to go beyond the top end of the range as we did in this particular year and late in this fiscal year. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Kaumil on the share repurchase, I just want to make sure it's clear that we haven't necessarily deprioritized share repurchase activity. As we mentioned, we have $1.2 billion worth of capacity under our current board authorization. In the near term, we think that it's more important to focus on getting our leverage ratio back down close to 3%. That being said, we do have the flexibility to be able to take advantage of weakness in the marketplace, as we said in our prepared remarks and be opportunistic. So it's absolutely something that we have the flexibility and optionality to execute against. Operator : Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : All right, thank you. Hi, everyone. Just maybe first, a quick clarification on your pricing. I'm wondering if you're still expecting to be in your 2% to 3% pricing guidance range for the full year since I guess that would imply only around 1% pricing in Q4? And then, I guess, a question on your guidance, just in terms of your beer guidance, you raised your full year sales and op income growth, but it does imply shipments will be down maybe as much as high single digits in Q4. So I'm aware you're lapping the distributor inventory build from last year, but just trying to reconcile this with some of the key initiatives you have out such as the rollout of Modelo Oro that's shipping now. So maybe if you could touch on that? And then just finally, I wanted to clarify if you expect your full year shipments and depletions to be broadly in line with each other? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. We do expect to be slightly above our 2% to 3% that we quoted in the last quarter, when all is said and done for the year. We also -- you should also recognize that mix is going to be higher and in large part because of the significant increase in the Chelada business, which is mix accretive in the overall portfolio. Garth, do you want to touch on the other piece? Garth Hankinson : Yes. Just in Q4, right? I mean as a reminder Bonnie, as we said throughout the year, you need to focus on sort of full year performance as that we're going to -- it was going to be sort of uneven or choppy results throughout the year, given the fact that we had the difficult overlaps as we were in the first half of last year dealing with some production-related issues in the second half of the year, we were building back inventories. So Q4 will certainly be muted this year versus what it was last year as last year was sort of artificially high due to that, those rebuilding efforts. Operator : Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi guys, good morning. So I know we spent a lot of time on depletions already, but just a couple more specific follow-ups to drive a finer point on it. A, just as we think about the deceleration we've seen in nontrack channels, the untracked channels the last couple of quarters here. I wanted to get a little more detail on your perspective on what's occurring there. Is it more just look, there's less momentum from an on-premise recovery post-COVID as you cycle the more normalized post-COVID comps, might there be more of a macro slowdown on the untracked off-premise channels as theoretically volume shift to track channels in areas like Bodegas, et cetera, just sort of break down that nontracked channel mix a bit in terms of talking about on-premise versus the untracked off-premise. So sort of extended a bit beyond the answer to Nadine's question? And then Modelo does look like it's disproportionately slowed. Just to check on that, it seems like your mindset is more that it's related to some of the weakness in California, some of the pricing impact, less sort of more temporary factors. Is any of that sort of related to more longer-term factors? Maybe it's at a much larger base and you're having -- you're not going to see as much growth? How do you sort of think about the Modelo brand and its performance recently? And then last, sorry for the multipart question, but price/mix was obviously very strong in the quarter. Some of that is higher year-over-year pricing. But presumably, some of that is mix also. So are you seeing a big shift to smaller packages, might that also be part of the reason for some of the depletion weakness. So I just wanted to get a little more clarity on those points as it related to depletions? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. Let's try to tackle those one at a time. Relative to Modelo, well, importantly, we are still seeing share gains in our five biggest markets. I think that's really important. But we're seeing several times those gains in the other markets with track channels, which we see as we've said many times before, a tremendous upside opportunity, this brand is still under shared, if you will, in terms of its household penetration compared to Corona Extra as an example. So there's just a lot of runway for growth for Modelo, and we remain very, very comfortable and confident in that brand's ability to continue to accelerate. Relative to the nontracked channels, we have continued to see on-premise get closer to where it had been, but it's still not quite to where it was before the pandemic, one. Two, it always takes a bit more time in some of the smaller Bodega style nontrack channels for pricing actions to work their way through. We've seen that happen before. And obviously, when you include and talk about the state of California, which is our single biggest share market, I'll remind you that Modelo Especial is bigger than Coors Light, Miller Light, Bud Light combined. When you see some of that happen it has a disproportionate impact in the short term until the pricing scenario plays itself through. So we don't believe this is any long-term trend issues. And our confidence in that is bolstered by the fact that as I stated earlier to one of the earlier questions, that we saw a very strong rebound in the State of California during December. Relative to price mix, a piece of that -- by the way, I should also mention, the number one share gainer in the State of California in the last four weeks happen to be Pacifico. I think that also speaks to the strength of our portfolio. Our portfolio is not a one-trick pony. We have a very strong place in the Corona brand, and the Modelo brand as well as Pacifico, all of which I think is very positive. Relative to the price mix question, right? We are seeing mix benefits. Some of that, as I stated just a moment ago is related to Chelada, given how big and important Chelada has gotten to be, that is mix accretive to our overall business. And therefore, the 40-plus percent growth profile that you see from that particular subsegment of Modelo does add significantly to the mix benefit that you observed. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my question relates to trade down in the category over the next 12 months, given the sort of obvious element in the room with the macro factors. And I wanted to tie that in your level of confidence on -- in your beer segment. So we are seeing trade down like we see it in the Nielsen data for economy beers, which, of course, have been donating share for a long period of time. So Bill, how concerning is that when we look at trade down behavior and we've seen it in past recessions as well. I just want to see how that's sort of informing the view. And I think relatedly, just given some of the concern that's out there in the market today, I think folks would be very keen on hearing your level of confidence, I guess, in your intermediate term, high single-digit growth outlook for the beer business. The color you guys gave on margins was certainly helpful. And it looks like you're taking a conservative tack there. Is it reasonable to take a sort of similarly conservative tack in your outlook for top line growth in the beer segment looking out to next year as well? So thank you for all that. Bill Newlands : Sure. I'll go backwards there on that. Hopefully, I won't miss anything. We maintain our continuing expectation of our medium-term guidance that we've said before, we don't think there's any radical change to where that has been. And as you know, we've often beaten that in the past. Relative to trade down, we'd obviously watch this carefully. We are very fortunate in the alcohol beverage business that we tend to be recession-resistant, doesn't mean that there's no impact that we are -- it is certainly resistant. The interesting thing that's occurred at this particular time is we've seen variable trade down at our price points. It doesn't mean -- you're correct, there has been trade down, but it has tended to be from price points below us going even lower rather than trade down from our brands which I think speaks very strongly to this year's strength of those brands. We have seen some trading around within our brands. I know -- as I said a moment ago, the Pacifico scenario in the state of California is spectacular. And I think is reflective of the growth potential for that business but it also reflected some trading around within our portfolio that occurred. So we are less concerned. We also keep our eye on it. We are less concerned about trade down from our price points. And remember, we are continuing to market these brands in the same way that we have historically. Our share of voice at the consumer level has never been higher. And I think that's important as well. We continue to invest behind our brands to support those in the eye and the mind of the consumer. And I think that's going to be critically important during a time when there could be some trade down lower in the category. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Strelzik : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I'll follow up quickly and then another question. The follow-up is on pricing again. I'm just curious, obviously recognizing that you're making some of the commentary about '24 being a bit more muted, while you're seeing some volatility in the depletion trends. So can you just talk about how you'll be approaching that or what you'll be watching as you move through the year potential flexibility there, things maybe holding a little bit better? And then the other question is just on product innovation, which you mentioned all the growth that's been driven by product innovation in the last several years. How does the innovation pipeline look now versus the last several years? Are you -- where are you seeing kind of the biggest opportunities or where is the focus? And is that more or less relevant in this consumer environment? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Yes, you bet. So relative to pricing, Andrew, we believe we're going to be more -- we took more price now in October which will inherently have some rollover benefit within the P&L. But relative to new pricing taken in next fiscal year, we expect them to be back in that 1% to 2% range that we have consistently delivered. We think that's important, especially in an environment where the consumer is overly sensitive to pricing actions. We're in an inflationary environment across all areas in the consumer space. And our view is we need to be careful in balancing our growth profile with our pricing profile. And we're going to continue that thought and approach going forward because we think it's in the best long-term interest of our brands. Innovation is going to continue to be an important part of what we do. As you know, we're very excited about the launch here in March of Modelo Oro. Certainly, the Chelada business continues to be one of our great growth drivers. And many of those things, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are products that are relatively new. As you probably know, this fiscal year, we added a 12 pack, we added 12 ounce. We're putting a variety pack in. That's been very successful also. So we're reaching more consumers and more consumer occasions than what we have done. And therefore, we continue to expect innovation to be an ongoing part of our success, same through the wine business. You saw that with things like Unshackled with things like our Red Blend in Meiomi. You saw that with Illuminate, with Kim Crawford. We're -- and innovation has been a strength of our companies and that we can put outstanding liquids in the bottle or can as the case may be and continue to do so, and we think that's going to be an important part together with our core organic growth of our growth profile going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi, everyone. So I'm just trying to get a little bit more comfort with the outlook on beer operating margins for next year. If I just take this concept of muted pricing and high single-digit inflation, I'm coming up with a little bit of operating margin compression, right, and maybe modest operating income growth in beer next year. And so I'm just wondering if that logic is sound or whether there are other things going on here like incremental savings programs for less spending elsewhere, which gets you to, I think, what you're implying is operating margins are flat, and if not, I just wonder if there's a more important revision of estimates that's required here, so thanks for any clarification on that? And any help you can provide on the bridge math. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look I think it's important to note that we will continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins, both this year and next year. As we said during the call, we're in the process right now of going through our annual planning review. And so we'll have a lot more detail to share on this with our Q4 earnings release and outlook for FY 2024. That being said, we did want to use today to acknowledge that next year's margin profile is going to be more in line with this year's margin profile for all the reasons that we discussed. Certainly, inflation continues to be enduring, and it's lasted longer than anyone had expected. And as we noted, many of our costs are contractual in nature, and those contracts when they get renegotiated, they get renegotiated at sort of the then inflation rate, not necessarily what the outlook for the year is. And we're going through that process again right now. So we'll have more clarity around where we land on those as we go through the next several weeks and months. We've talked about hedges in commodities, and commodities coming off their highs, but certainly, they certainly haven't reverted yet to where they were pre-pandemic, so they will continue to be a bit of a headwind for us next year. Depreciation will also be a bit of a headwind next year for us as we lay around the incremental CapEx that I referenced to Lauren's question, we will -- we do expect to go live with our ABA capacity expansion at Nava as well as that incremental capacity at Obregon. What's the impact to that depreciation on, again, we'll know better about that in the next few months because that's all dependent upon when assets are put into service. And then as you know, pricing will be a bit more muted. Again, we're still going to be within our 1% to 2% algorithm. We just won't be above 2%, like we have been not just this fiscal year but last fiscal year as well. And so those will be some of the headwinds. And again, we always have tailwinds for as well. The continued momentum of the brands, right? We'll continue to -- the brands will continue to grow and drive efficiencies, and we always have a robust set of cost savings initiatives that we will avail ourselves up. And again, we'll have more detail around what -- how each of those impact margins for FY '24 as we release our FY '23 annual results, but we wanted to acknowledge that on this call. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just one quick one for me. Garth, I guess while we're talking about '24 there's a $26 million, I guess, gross contribution after marketing hit from the Wine & Spirits divestitures that affected fiscal '23. So does any of that spill into fiscal '24? Or are there still I guess drags from divestitures that we should be thinking about as we're just polishing up our '24 model today? Garth Hankinson : There won't be any more necessarily more drags per se from that, as the cost will come out. I won't say that the impact that you'll have is that there will just be a comparability issued for the first sort of three quarters of the year, but no further drag as we move into the year. Operator : And our final question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Vivien Azer : Hi, thank you very much. I was hoping we could pivot to the wine segment, given the conversations around down trading in beer Bill, I was hoping to get some perspective on what you guys think you're seeing in wine, the Nielsen data would suggest that there is down trading there? And if you could just remind us, given all of the divestitures that you guys have done, what percentage of your wine revenues are coming from $20 and above? Bill Newlands : Sure, you bet Vivien. We have seen some more trading down in the wine business in the fact that private label has been tending to outpace branded sales by roughly 2.1 points in the last 12 weeks. So that has had some impact. What's interesting is you get a bit of a, I would say, a buying model scenario, meaning you're seeing some trade down at sort of mid- to lower price points. And then you're doing fine if you get into higher price points and a little bit in the middle has been a little shaky is some of what we're seeing. So -- which is a little different than what you have seen historically in these particular environments. As I said in my prepared remarks, there's been a pretty radical change in the amount of our business in the premium sector. I would -- I didn't categorize it as $20. But we're well over 60% of our total business now occurring in the premium and fine wine sector, which was 34% just a few years ago. So we're seeing a pretty radical move within our business as we thought what if we reshape the portfolio because over the long term that's where the consumer is going. And we believe that's not only where there's better profitability but there's better growth as well. So we believe the work that we've done is bearing fruit, and I think it plays itself out in terms of the growth profile of some of our higher end and critical brands. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Rob. Despite the ongoing inflationary headwinds affecting the concern in our business over the last three quarters, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth and remain well placed to further build on the solid track record we have established against advancing our long-term strategic initiatives for nearly four years now. Our Beer business continues to lead in share gains, growth and margins and we're confident in our ability to capture the significant opportunities we still see for our core and our next wave brands. Our Wine & Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum as well advancing our higher-end brands, DTC channels and international footprint, all yielding noticeable results. Lastly, the performance of our businesses, coupled with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities has allowed us to maintain our investment-grade rating, surpass our cash returns goal, grow our beer production capacity and execute small growth accretive M&A. With all that said, let me reiterate, looking ahead, we remain committed and believe we now have an even stronger foundation to deliver sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. Thanks for everyone for joining the call, and I wish you a happy, safe and healthy New Year. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to, Joe Suarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Joe Suarez : Thank you, Darryl. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands year-end fiscal 2023 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with our Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our company\u2019s website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today\u2019s call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that, we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us end our call on-time. Thanks in advance. And now, here is Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that our team delivered another solid year of performance in fiscal \u201823, driving a 7% increase in net sales and a 3% increase in comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds faced throughout the year. We delivered record net sales and comparable operating income of $9.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. We were recognized as the number one growth leader among large CPG companies by IRI and Boston Consulting Group in calendar year \u201822. And we\u2019re the only CPG company of scale in recent times to make their top 10 ranking for 10 consecutive years. Our performance was driven by strong execution of our strategy, which centers on continuing to build powerful brands that people love; to introduce consumer led innovations that address emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for profitable growth; to deploy capital with discipline, while balancing priorities; and operate in a way that is both good for business and good for the world. Here\u2019s how each of our segments delivered against each of these objectives in fiscal \u201823. Our Beer Business delivered another year of double-digit net sales growth, and its 13th consecutive year of shipment volume growth, while maintaining best-in-class margins. We extended our lead as the number one high end beer supplier in the U.S. and as the leading share gainer in IRI channels with a 12% increase in dollar sales. We increased depletions by nearly 27 million cases, and delivered net sales and operating income growth well above the initial top end of our guidance range. We continue to build momentum for our anchor brands. Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and the number one high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by 9%; Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the number three high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by nearly 4%; and Pacifico gained significant momentum as a top 10 share gainer in tracked channels, delivering depletion growth of over 30%. Several consumer-led innovations within our Modelo Chelada franchise served as growth catalysts in fiscal \u201823. Our Naranja Picosa flavor, a new variety pack, added over 1.6 million new cases of depletions to our Chelada brands. Our new Lim\u00f3n y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped to more than double the depletions of that flavor to over 5.6 million cases. And in tracked channels, the Lim\u00f3n y Sal 12-pack was a top 15 new package SKU and a variety pack of top 10 new brands. We continue to invest in our beer business, deploying over $800 million in capital investments in fiscal \u201823, which supported the ongoing expansions of our growing capacity at Obregon, the continued development of our new ABA alcohol production line at Nava and the early stage work at our new site in Veracruz. As part of our commitment to water stewardship, we recently worked with local efficients and water authorities to complete a project that updated water infrastructure in the city of Zaragoza, near our Nava facility, which improved water accessibility for most of the families in this town that is approximately 13,000 people. This is just one of a number of efforts we have underway in Mexico as part of our water stewardship commitment. As we look to fiscal \u201824, we will continue to prioritize investments against our core brands in Modelo Especial, Corona Extra and Pacifico. We believe that the fundamental growth drivers for these brands, including awareness, distribution and demographic upside opportunities, remain as strong as ever. We\u2019re excited about several consumer-led innovations that are currently hitting the market, including Modelo Oro, which exceeded both external and internal benchmarks in three test markets where we trialed it last fiscal year; and Corona nonalcoholic, which addresses the rapidly growing betterment trends. We\u2019ll also continue to build momentum for our Chelada franchise with the introduction of a second 12-ounce 12-pack for our best-selling traditional Chelada flavor and with the new spicy watermelon flavor, Sandia Picante. And we\u2019ll continue to deploying capital to enhance our growing capacity to meet the anticipated continuing robust demand for our products, both near and long term. Shifting gears. Our Wine and Spirits business has transformed from a U.S. wholesale business, mainly serving the mainstream segment to a global omnichannel competitor with a higher-end focused portfolio. And this strategy is working as the strength of our higher-end brands supported our outperformance against the broader market. While lower demand for our mainstream brands drove a 2.1% volume decline for our Wine and Spirits portfolio and IRI channels, we outperformed the 2.6% volume decline for the combined U.S. Wine and Spirits categories in fiscal \u201823. We continue to focus on the growth of our consumer preferred higher-end brands within our portfolio. Our Aspira portfolio, which includes our Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands, delivered double-digit shipment growth. In addition, it significantly outpaced the Fine Wine and Craft Spirits segment, led by The Prisoner Wine Company, which delivered depletion growth approaching 10% and our Craft Spirits portfolio, which achieved depletion growth approaching 29% in U.S. wholesale. In addition, these brands delivered exciting consumer-led innovations such as The Prisoner\u2019s, Blindfold, Blanc de Noir, Casa Noble\u2019s ultra-premium Marqu\u00e9s tequila and our Mi CAMPO ready-to-drink cocktails, which are still in early stages of their life cycles, but are contributing to our expanded presence -- higher end of the market. Meanwhile, our Ignite portfolio continued to drive the momentum of our premium brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, which delivered depletion growth of 5% and 7%, respectively, both gaining share in their respective segments. We continued to complement the growth of our core premium products with innovations that broaden the offerings of these consumer preferred brands. As an example, Meiomi\u2019s new Red Blend remains the number two wine SKU since its launch and Kim Crawford\u2019s Prosecco was the number two new wine brand. Within our Ignite portfolio, the performance of our higher-end premium brands was offset by our remaining mainstream Wine and Spirits brands, namely Woodbridge and SVEDKA, which experienced declines versus the market in the U.S. We continue to focus on stabilizing and revitalizing these brands. To further support our strategy to reshape our Wine and Spirits portfolio to the higher end, we divested several residual mainstream brands and acquired a smaller, higher-end wine brand and a ready-to-drink cocktail brand. Of note, our relatively recent acquisition of My Favorite Neighbor portfolio is delivering substantial growth and performing above our initial expectations. So overall, in fiscal \u201823, while net sales for our Wine and Spirits business declined just under 4%, a large part of that was due to the recent divestiture of primarily mainstream brands that I just referenced. And despite the strong performance of our higher-end brands, on an organic basis, net sales declined by 2%, mainly driven by lower demand for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends, which I also noted earlier. We continued to build momentum for our higher-end brands and continued to accelerate our performance in key channels, such as direct-to-consumer and international markets, which grew net sales by 29% and organic net sales by 4%, respectively. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to continue to grow the DTC and international markets by investing in our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands that tilt their growth toward DTC, international routes to market. Importantly, our Wine and Spirits business delivered operating margin expansion in fiscal \u201823, further demonstrating the benefits of its strategy and making additional progress towards its medium-term targets. Overall, we are exiting the year in Wine and Spirits on solid footing, and I remain confident in the pathway of that business. The solid performance driven by our beer and Wine and Spirits teams enabled us to return nearly $2.3 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in fiscal \u201823, and we further demonstrated our capacity to conduct opportunistic share buybacks with an additional nearly $300 million of repurchases in the fourth quarter. This means our dividend payments and buybacks since fiscal \u201820 totaled more than $5.4 billion, well above our $5 billion goal. Moving forward, we plan to continue to deliver against our capital allocation priorities with our disciplined approach. Our fiscal \u201824 earnings and cash flow outlook should enable us to move closer to our net leverage ratio target to support dividend payments in line with our payout ratio target to continue to deploy capital to beer growing capacity additions and hospitality investments in Wine and Spirits business and to opportunistically pursue additional share repurchases and small gap filling acquisitions. Lastly, we remain committed to making meaningful progress against our enterprise ESG goals, which include reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% in fiscal -- by fiscal \u201825 from a fiscal \u201820 baseline and restoring more than 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from local water ships, while also improving accessibility and quality of water for communities where we operate between fiscal \u201823 and \u201825. Water stewardship in particular, has been a top priority for our team, and I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have already surpassed our fiscal \u201825 goal related to water restoration. We\u2019ll look to announce later this year new targets for our water stewardship efforts as well as other important areas that are part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the long-term viability of our local communities and this environment. We have also significantly enhanced our ESG reporting getting references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and considering recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. As we look ahead, we intend to continue to take steps to more fully integrate ESG into our core business planning process, establishing thoughtful, specific, measurable and time-bound targets supported by robust strategies and operating plans that we can map progress against. We believe this approach best serves the interest of our business, shareholders, other stakeholders and our surrounding communities as it seeks to integrate ESG into our business operations and helps ensure that we can clearly deliver on our stated commitments. So in summary, we delivered another solid year of performance, resulting in record net sales and comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds faced throughout the year. Our performance was driven by strong execution of our strategy, and we continue to make good progress against all dimensions, building brands that people love, complementing growth of our core products with consumer led innovation, deploying capital with discipline while balancing priorities against our organization and continuing to operate in a way that is both, good for business and good for the world. With another strong year of execution against our strategy behind us, we\u2019re quite confident in our ability to continue building momentum in fiscal \u201824. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal \u201823 was another solid year for our company as we continued to relentlessly deliver on our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Despite the inflationary pressures that both our industry and consumers have been facing, we demonstrated yet again the strength of our adaptable businesses, higher end brands and resilient teams. We expect the same focus and dedication to further support our momentum in fiscal \u201824. So, let\u2019s review in more detail our full year fiscal \u201823 performance and fiscal \u201824 outlook. As always, I will focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the fiscal \u201823 performance of our beer business. Net sales increased $713 million or 11%, exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by solid shipment growth of approximately 7% as strong demand continued across our portfolio, supporting a $464 million uplift in net sales from incremental volumes. Net sales also benefited from favorable pricing in excess of our unusual 1% to 2% average annual pricing algorithm. As we previously noted, the incremental pricing actions taken in fiscal \u201823 were in response to cost pressures across the value chain due to inflationary headwinds. We introduced larger pricing increases and made pricing adjustments in certain markets ahead of our regular case. Depletion growth for the year was over 7%, which, as Bill noted, was driven by continued strong growth in our largest brands, Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and Modelo Chelada brands. On-premise depletions grew 15% year-over-year, and on-premise volume accounted for approximately 12% of total depletions in fiscal \u201823, nearing the mid-teen volume share from prior to the start of pandemic. As previously guided, our shipments and depletions were closely aligned on an absolute basis. Moving on to the bottom line for our beer business. Operating income increased 6%, also exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was largely driven by a $492 million benefit from net sales growth and yielded an operating margin of 38.3%, which was in line with our implied guidance range. As expected and noted over fiscal \u201823, operating margins were negatively affected by inflationary headwinds. For the import portion of our beer business, which represents nearly the entirety of COGS, we faced an increase of approximately 16% in our raw materials and packaging costs, which was largely driven by inflationary pressures that resulted in an 8% increase on a per case basis. This reflected some benefits from the lapping of the seltzer obsolescence charge in fiscal \u201822 as excluding any obsolescence impact, the increases in our raw materials and packaging costs would have been 20% on an absolute basis and 12% on a per case basis. Note that these two COGS categories, including the obsolescence impact represented just over 55% of the import portion\u2019s COGS in fiscal \u201823. We also saw a 12% year-over-year increase in freight costs, mainly driven by incremental shipment expenses that were offset by efficiency initiatives. Freight costs were 5% up on a per case basis and account for just under 25% of import. And we faced a 14% rise in labor and overhead costs that was mainly driven by our brewery capacity investments. Labor and overhead were up 7% on a per case basis and accounted for just under 15% of import COGS. In addition, operating margins for the beer business were also affected by a $41 million or nearly 22% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments. A $55 million or nearly 9% increase in marketing spend related to incremental investments in sports sponsorships and a $48 million or nearly 14% increase in our -- in other SG&A, driven by incremental sales support to align with the momentum of our beer brands. Note, however, that while our marketing investments increased when compared to the prior year, they were still within our 9% to 10% range as a percentage of net sales. All of that said, and it\u2019s important to note that we still delivered best-in-class margins for our beer business in fiscal \u201823. Now shifting to our Wine and Spirits business. First, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our wine portfolio in fiscal \u201823. So during today\u2019s remarks, I will also be discussing top line on an organic basis, which excludes the contributions from the divested brands. As Bill noted, despite the strong performance of our higher-end Wine and Spirits brands on an organic basis, net sales decline of 2%, ultimately landing in our guidance range. The decline in net sales, excluding the impact of the divestiture, was primarily driven by our mainstream brands as they faced challenging market conditions and lapping of prior fiscal year inventory build. Again, this decline was partially offset by strong growth in our higher-end brands, which outperformed in the U.S. in the higher-end category for both Wine and Spirits and total U.S. wine market. Our higher-end brands also had strong growth in our emerging and rapidly expanding direct-to-consumer channels and international markets. Over time, we expect our portfolio to continue to migrate toward the higher end and for these higher-end brands, channels and markets to support our top line growth acceleration. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by under 8% and depletions decreased by 3%. As just noted, this volume decline, which reduced organic net sales by $148 million, was driven primarily by our mainstream brands, as mix and price, largely driven by our higher-end brands provided a $111 million uplift to organic net sales. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business, following their divestiture in fiscal \u201823, increased 2%, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to nearly 23%, also reflecting the same exclusion. This margin increase was driven by a $12 million uplift from net sales flow-through as favorable product mix was supported by lower grade costs as well as a strong New Zealand harvest. Benefits from other cost savings actions primarily resulting in lower-grade costs that helped to partially offset higher logistics material costs and more efficient marketing expense from enhanced investment strategies, which increased focus the highest return opportunities which supported a $20 million tailwind to operating income. These benefits were partially offset by $17 million in higher SG&A from increased headcount as we continue to strategically invest in our growing DTC channels. We remain well positioned to continue to expand margins in our Wine and Spirits business over time with mix improvements and productivity initiatives in the future. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. In fiscal \u201823, our corporate expense included approximately $270 million from SG&A and $20 million from unconsolidated investments related to our ventures portfolio, all-in, landing at the low end of our guidance at $290 million. Within the SG&A portion of corporate expense, the implementation of our DBA program, which stands for digital business acceleration, accounted for $47 million. As a reminder, we introduced our multiyear DBA initiative in fiscal \u201823 and expect similar investments to carry into fiscal \u201824. Interest expense for the year increased 12% to approximately $400 million, coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was driven primarily by the financing of the stock reclassification, which took place in Q3 of fiscal \u201823 as well as the impact of rising interest rates on approximately 15% of our debt with adjustable rates. Our full year comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 19.2% versus 17.5% last year as we lapped favorability in fiscal \u201822, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation activity. Free cash flow for fiscal \u201823, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx, was above the upper end of our guidance range at $1.7 billion. CapEx totaled $1 billion, including over $800 million of investment in our beer business. CapEx came in below our guidance, primarily due to timing shifts in the spend for certain materials and equipment of our Mexico brewery investments at our Nava and Obregon facilities. As of the end of fiscal \u201823, our Mexico brewery operations had a total nominal capacity of approximately 42 million hectoliters. This includes 32.5 million hectoliters at our Nava facility and 9.5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility. This represents 1 million hectoliter uplift at our Nava facility relative to the capacity we communicated a few months ago. This uplift is once again the result of our continued productivity initiatives that have unlocked additional production flexibility from the existing footprint of our breweries. As a reminder, earlier this year, we shared that these initiatives had unlocked additional capacity of 1.5 million hectoliters at Nava and 0.5 million hectoliters at Oregon. In light of the 2.5 million hectoliters of productivity capacity unlocked at Nava in fiscal \u201823, we have slightly adjusted the ramp-up plans for our new ABA production line at that facility, which I will discuss shortly. With that, let\u2019s move now to our outlook for fiscal \u201824. We expect a comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, excluding Canopy equity earnings. For fiscal \u201824, our beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%. As Bill discussed earlier, we expect continued strong volume growth momentum to be largely driven by our icon brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra and next wave brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands. We anticipate our full year fiscal \u201824 shipments and depletions to track each other closely, both on an absolute basis and in terms of the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, despite some fluctuations in the last few years in our quarterly shipment cases and year-over-year growth rates due to severe weather and pandemic-related impacts, we expect the cadence of our shipments in fiscal \u201824 to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern. We anticipate approximately 55% of our fiscal \u201824 wines to ship in the first half as we meet peak summer demand for our products. In addition, from a quarterly perspective, particularly when looking at year-over-year growth rates, we also expect shipment and depletion comparisons to still show some variability as they always have, as we manage inventory levels around seasonality throughout the year and our regular brewery maintenance activities in Q3. All of that said, we do not expect to have any incremental lapping variability in our shipment growth rate for Q4 as we did in fiscal \u201823. From a pricing perspective, at this stage, we are planning for average annual pricing within our 1% to 2% algorithm. We are mindful that consumers will likely continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions for the foreseeable future and that our pricing increases in the last 2 fiscal years were above this algorithm. As we advance throughout the year, we will continue to monitor inflationary dynamics and potential recessionary risks to ensure our pricing is appropriately balanced to support the momentum of our brands. We will provide any further update in that regard as part of our future quarterly calls. In terms of operating income growth. Our beer business is targeting 5% to 7%, which implies a fiscal \u201824 operating margin of approximately 38%. As we have discussed, we continue to expect our beer operating margin to be negatively impacted by inflationary COGS headwinds. The majority of these relate to the year-over-year adjustments in our packaging and raw material costs, which, on average, represent a high-single-digit increase in absolute terms for these inputs in the import portion of our beer business. While prices for some of these inputs are off their peaks, most are subject to contractual terms that reflect annual adjustments based on trailing pricing data and some still remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic prices. In fiscal \u201824, we expect packaging and raw material for our imports to account for approximately 55% to 60% of our costs. In addition, we expect freight to be approximately 20% to 25% of costs and reflect a high single-digit year-over-year absolute increase as we continue to face annual volume and contractual increases. And labor and overhead to be approximately 15% of costs and reflect a high-teens increase in absolute terms, largely driven by increased headcount and training tied to our brewery capacity investments. For our beer business, we expect incremental depreciation of approximately $35 million to $40 million as we continue to bring into production incremental growing capacity from our investments, particularly at Obregon, in fiscal \u201824. As noted earlier, the incremental capacity unlocked from our existing Nava facility footprint from productivity initiatives has given us additional flexibility on the ramp-up of our new ABA line. We now intend to spend a bit more time optimizing that new additional ABA production to better support the strong growth of our Modelo Chelada brands. Accordingly, we anticipate the ABA line will be ramping up in Q4 of FY24. Conversely, we have been able to accelerate the ramp-up of our next 5 million hectoliter investment at Obregon to Q1 of fiscal \u201824. This is being enabled by the move of brewery and package equipment that we had previously intended for use in Mexicali. Now, going back to operating margins. We plan to execute a number of productivity initiatives to help offset inflationary pressures. The expectations shared for our beer business COGS in fiscal \u201824 have operational efficiencies and cost-saving actions embedded into them. These initiatives include benefits from our ongoing hedging program and contractual negotiation efforts as well as from our fiscal \u201823 DBA program. To that end, it is relevant to note that only around 25% of our beer business COGS are subject to contractual pricing adjustments within fiscal \u201824, and then we expect our hedging program to reduce our exposure to those adjustments for about 10% to 15% of COGS. In addition, we expect to deliver marketing and other SG&A efficiencies, including an even greater focus on optimizing these types of investments toward our icon and next wave brands. So despite remaining slightly below our medium-term operating margin target we expect our fiscal \u201824 efforts to still yield best-in-class results for our beer business, and we expect all quarters within fiscal \u201824 to deliver operating margins above this latest quarter\u2019s result. Moving to the outlook for our Wine and Spirits business. Our fiscal -- for fiscal \u201824, we are targeting organic net sales to be relatively flat within 0.5 percentage point from fiscal \u201823 net sales, excluding $38.5 million of net sales from the brands divested in fiscal \u201823. We expect to continue the strong growth of our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands and in our DTC channels and international markets. These segments of our business will help to offset the headwinds we expect to face with our mainstream U.S. wholesale brands, which are facing challenging market conditions due to ongoing consumer-led premiumization. Conversely to our beer business, we expect our Wine and Spirits business to ship approximately 55% of our fiscal \u201824 volumes in the second half, again, in line with seasonal demand for our Wine and Spirits products. More notably, despite continued inflationary pressures, we are targeting operating income growth between 2% to 4%, exclusive of $19.5 million of gross profit, less marketing, related to brands divested in fiscal \u201823. This implies an operating margin improvement of at least 40 basis points. The primary margin improvement drivers for fiscal \u201824 include additional mix improvement, particularly with our further optimized portfolio, driven by ongoing growth in our higher-end brands from continued consumer-led premiumization trends, enduring growth momentum in our higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels and targeted international metro areas, primarily through our Aspira portfolio brands, additional innovation with new consumer-led products that help extend our higher-end offerings and stabilize our mainstream brands, reduced marketing spend relative to net sales with optimized investments increasingly focused on high-growth, high-return areas and additional SG&A reductions in cost management initiatives. Similar to our beer business, we expect approximately 25% of our Wine and Spirits business COGS to be subject to adjustments within fiscal \u201824. Now moving to expectations for the rest of the P&L in fiscal \u201824. Corporate expense, including just the SG&A portion, is expected to be approximately $270 million. We expect to see favorability from the termination of certain compensation and benefits that will not be payable in fiscal \u201824 following the retirement of Rob and Richard Sands from their executive roles for the reclassification agreement, approved by shareholders in fiscal \u201823, offset by the impact of inflationary pressures and merit-driven salary increases. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $500 million for the year. This is a 25% increase from fiscal \u201823 and is primarily due to the incremental interest expense associated with the financing of the reclassification. The comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings is expected to be around 19%. Rounding up the P&L, we anticipate approximately $40 million in non-controlling interest benefits and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately 184 million. Turning to cash flow. We expect fiscal \u201824 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. CapEx includes approximately $1 billion to support our Mexico brewery investment and most of the remainder will support our Wine and Spirits hospitality updates. To wrap up, I would like to reiterate that our refreshed capital allocation priorities that we have introduced and discussed throughout fiscal \u201823 and earlier by Bill remain unchanged. We remain committed to a disciplined financial foundation by maintaining an investment-grade rating as we move towards our net leverage ratio target, delivering returns to shareholders via both dividends in line with our payout ratio goal and through incremental share repurchases to at least cover dilution while remaining opportunistic for any additional repurchases, continuing to support the growth of our businesses through deployed capital in our beer brewing additions and in our Wine and Spirits hospitality investments. And lastly, through smaller acquisitions that will fill gaps or enhance our existing portfolio. We believe that this strong disciplined capital allocation strategy, combined with exceptional execution, will empower us to be a premier shareholder return generator for the foreseeable future. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing most recently and that makes you feel confident about the 7% to 9%, your sales growth outlook and particularly in light of the broad deceleration in consumption called out by retailers in March? And related to that, are there any dynamics between shipments ahead of the Cinco de Mayo, start of the summer and the depletions as we move into the first quarter and throughout the year? And if I can squeeze on the pricing front, you mentioned the 1% to 2%, but I understand some of the competitors decided to just pushback. And given the dynamics that you had towards the fall last year, if you\u2019re going to be mostly looking to do pricing for the fall? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. Thanks for the question, and good morning to you. A couple of things that give us the confidence in the 7% to 9% range. First of all, we saw a very strong start to the year in markets like Texas and Florida, which have both seen double-digit increases in the first month of the year. Now acknowledging the state of California has been challenging, but I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m very excited about, about California. In Q4, we saw our distribution growth, our effective distribution grew by 3.6%, Q4 versus the Q4 prior, or simple distribution despite a very broad market capability there, saw a simple distribution grow up 2%. And our draft panels went up over 9%. What this says to me is that we are well prepared when California gets back into their normal weather pattern versus what we saw this year. So, we\u2019re very comfortable. Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be giving you this guidance if we thought otherwise. But we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll be in that 7% to 9% range that we noted today. Garth, do you want to touch on the pricing point? Garth Hankinson : Yes. So I mean, as we stated in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re comfortable with the pricing at our 1% to 2% algorithm. Obviously, we will continue -- our approach to pricing gives us the flexibility throughout the year to monitor what\u2019s the macroeconomic and the inflationary recession impacts -- potential recession impacts are on our consumer. It allows us to monitor competitor behavior and give us the flexibility to act agilely when we see a reason to move on price. So that will be something that I said in my prepared remarks that to the extent we make any changes throughout the year, we will provide updates on our regular quarterly calls. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Just a quick cleanup. Bill, I\u2019m not sure if you can comment on March depletion trends. I mean, presumably, given the importance of California, I suspect it\u2019s probably running a bit below what we saw in the fourth quarter. Maybe you could just comment on that. But my broader question is on the Oro launch, and maybe just follow-up there on your expectations, comments on cannibalization risk. And then I think importantly, sort of context around how we should be thinking about this rollout relative to the premier launch several years ago and the degree of incremental spend? If I\u2019m not mistaken, Garth, you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think that was in the $35 million to $40 million range of incremental spend behind that rollout, but just some context around there would be helpful. So, thank you both for that. I appreciate it. Bill Newlands : Sure. So that I don\u2019t step on myself after I just got done saying at CAGNY that I wasn\u2019t going to talk about depletions anymore, I won\u2019t specifically talk about March depletions other than to say they\u2019re pretty much in line with what we expected. As I did note in my prior answer to Andrea, Texas, Florida were up double digits. Certainly, California was challenged this particular start to the year. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that as we progress in the year, it\u2019s extremely unusual to have rain, snow or flooding, once you get into May, June, July and August in the state of California. So much like we\u2019ve seen many other times when there\u2019s a dislocation of particular market, we expect that that would pass over time. Second, related to your Oro question, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to be very sensible about the rollout of Oro. I\u2019m pleased to say that our beer group has done an extremely good job of getting distribution into the marketplace. As you know, we\u2019re less than a month in on that particular project. But we were very positive about the cannibalization rates that we saw in the 3 test markets. We saw incrementality above 60% in those markets, which we are very pleased with. And we really think it fills a gap, particularly with our core Hispanic consumer, who has been looking for an alternative to some of the other light beer scenarios. So, we\u2019re very positive about that, but we\u2019re going to do it in a very sensible and approachable way. For those of you who watched March Madness, you would have noted, we had -- we started our media campaign during that particular event. And this launch will be supported by significant media over the course of the summer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : On the beer depletion side, can you discuss a bit the trends you\u2019re seeing on-premise? The gap looked better in terms of on-premise and some of the smaller store on track channels relative to track channels versus Q2 and Q3. So just would love to get an update there. And then, also do you think you\u2019re seeing any broader macro impacts in your portfolio? Maybe give us a bit of update on trade down in general in beer and what\u2019s occurring there and any impacts to your business? Thanks. Bill Newlands : You bet. So in terms of on-premise, on-premise continues to grow, as we noted in our prepared remarks. We continue to see acceleration in the on-premise, which we think is very good. We\u2019re not quite back to where we were from a normal standpoint that where we sat before the pandemic, but we continue to make progress against that as we are seeing more and more often that consumers are being out in the marketplace and consuming on-premise. So, we remain optimistic. Our growth profile in the on-premise really continues to accelerate. As I think many on-premise accounts are looking more and more for brands that resonate consistently with consumers. And obviously, we have those and that speaks very well. I used the example of a well saturated market like California seeing draft panels on our business were up 9% in the fourth quarter last year. And I think that\u2019s a great reflection of the potential that still exists for us in the on-premise. Relative to your question about trade down, we have seen very little trade down against our portfolio. Certainly, there has been some, it appears, but it tends to occur at lower price points than ours. So there are some consumers that are showing some concern about general inflationary macroeconomic trends. But by and large, that has occurred at lower price points that where our brands compete. And that\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen relative to the pure loyalty we see against our brands. It\u2019s the benefit of having consumer preferred brands in our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Just a follow-up on Garth on some of your guidance comments, and I don\u2019t know if I -- just maybe I didn\u2019t follow you. But I think you were talking about productivity measures that would help get to the margin target. And then you talked kind of very quickly or with some points on hedging programs and the amount hedged or not -- and I just -- I apologize, I lost you on that. But I was kind of trying to connect what hedging would have to do with productivity and trying to exactly the point you were trying to make. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So sure, Robert, thanks for the question. And just so as Joe indicated at the beginning of the remarks, we are going to be posting some slides to our website immediately following this call specific to the efficiency -- productivity efficiencies and the hedging. The point on that is it\u2019s just like in any given year, we have certain productivity goals, efficiency goals, savings to help offset the impact of cost increases related to inflation. So, that\u2019s no different than any other year. And the point of the comment was that those increases that I had stated previously, those are net of those efficiencies. And then on the point around hedging is just that we continue to have a fairly robust hedging policy program. Typically, we are only able to hedge around 10% to 15% of what\u2019s in our cost of goods. And so, we are hedging against those things right now. And as we enter this year, we\u2019re at where we would normally be in terms of the percent of commodities that are hedged. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just a few follow-ups. So -- just curious on -- Bill, you mentioned some of the distribution gains you\u2019ve seen in California. Just was hoping to get some context on your view on resets and kind of what you\u2019re seeing more broadly, especially in the markets where you\u2019re undershared relative to where you are in California? And then the second question is just there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the trade about some of the other brewers perhaps rolling back some pricing or promoting back some of the recent price increases. Just wanted to get some context on kind of philosophically how you think about if that were to happen, kind of would you need to react or not? And just would love your context and perspective on that. Bill Newlands : Yes. You bet, Nik. Thanks for the question. One of the things that relative to resets, we are doing extremely well in reset situations. And I think it\u2019s just simple, good business because with our portfolio representing more than 80% of the growth in the total beer category, it just makes sense for retailers to increase our shelf positions versus the competition. You see, as we said in our prepared remarks, Modelo being the number 1 growth driver and Corona being the number 3 growth driver and Pacifico being the top 10 growth driver, these brands demand more space on the shelf. And we\u2019re very fortunate that our team is specifically focused on that very topic. Relative to pricing, as Garth noted, we carefully analyze the elasticities against our brands, and I\u2019ve said this on many other occasions, we\u2019re very mindful that we want to keep our consumer. And our pricing strategies over time have been to be sensible and approachable to ensure that we keep our consumers. We\u2019re going to raise within our normal algorithm this year in the 1% to 2%, as Garth noted, but we should then expect no rolling back of any pricing scenarios from us this year because we have been judicious and sensible about keeping the consumer engaged with us as we move pricing in the past. We\u2019ll continue to monitor to that carefully as the year goes on, as we always do. On a monthly basis, we analyze elasticities and drivers and drags, which you\u2019ve all heard from Jim Sabia over time. But we see absolutely no need to be rolling back pricing in any market because we think we were very appropriate in what we have done historically, which should allow us to be right back in our algorithm going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I had a question on your free cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. It\u2019s a fair amount below your historical run rate. So maybe you could highlight the key puts and takes that are going to impact your free cash flow this year? And then, you completed your share repurchase goals to date and your $5 billion return to shareholder target, but you didn\u2019t necessarily announce a new return goal. So, curious how you\u2019re thinking about your capital allocation priorities going forward? And then, maybe what\u2019s realistic to consider for cash return to shareholders this year and beyond thinking about this in the context of the CapEx needs, your leverage targets, et cetera? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Thanks, Bonnie. So, to start on free cash flow. I guess to start on free cash flow, we need to start at operating cash flow, right? So operating cash flow is a bit down this year versus last year. And the primary drivers of that are really a couple fold. One is there is the increase in interest that I referenced in my opening remarks pretty much at 25% increase on a year-over-year basis, and that\u2019s really reflective primarily of the debt and the interest associated with the collapse, and then to a lesser extent, the remaining floating rate debt that we have on our books. Additionally, we\u2019ll have higher cash paid taxes next year due to the U.S. -- and some nonrecurring tax benefits that we had in FY23 and then to a smaller extent some changes in working capital. Moving further down the list. We\u2019ll continue to have significant investments in CapEx, as you heard. And so, that\u2019s really -- those are the factors that are driving the free cash -- the operating cash flow and free cash flow ranges that we outlined earlier. As it relates to the share returns of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We still have nearly $1 billion left under our existing Board authorization for share repurchases. As we mentioned in our comments, at the very least, we will buy back throughout the year, but we will continue to be agile and be able to take advantage of market conditions, just like we did in Q4, where, as Bill noted in his remarks, we aggressively bought back almost $300 million worth of shares as we saw some -- what we consider dislocations in price. So, that\u2019s going to -- that will be how we continue throughout the year. We actually like the ability to have that flexibility. And so, it\u2019s something that will obviously continue to be a very critical component of our capital allocation strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : So I wanted to ask about the pricing cadence and the commentary that you\u2019re going to be monitoring the health of the consumer. And you provided a lot of color in the response to both Andrea and Nik\u2019s question. But I guess if you don\u2019t plan to roll back prices, can you maybe just talk about what actions you would be willing to take if the environment were to deteriorate, would that just be pricing at the lower end? And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is if the pricing outlook were to really change at all, how would that impact your ability to achieve your margin targets? Could you lean in more elsewhere, or would it be more difficult to achieve? Bill Newlands : Well, there\u2019s a lot of negative what ifs in the question, which, frankly, we don\u2019t see coming to pass. If you look historically what our beer business has been able to accomplish, we have maintained a very consistent approach to pricing over time, 1% to 2% year after year after year. The last couple of years, as you know, we\u2019ve significantly gone beyond that in an effort to hedge against some of the strong inflationary pressures that all consumer companies have faced. Our belief is we are in a very good position to do our historical 1% to 2% pricing increase. That\u2019s based on a lot of analytics and a lot of elasticity assessments that we do on an ongoing basis. We are very comfortable with that, and we feel like that\u2019s going to be an appropriate play for the course of this fiscal year, which should allow us to do everything we said. I would also note, just as an adjunct to that, one of the things that I said at CAGNY was how strong the Modelo share was in its two strongest markets, which was California and Nevada, where we were double digit. I\u2019m pleased to report that at this point that actually is now in four states, which includes both New Jersey and Texas, which again just continues to show that our growth profile outside of the state of California, it remains a tremendous growth opportunity for our business over the long term and also helps to support what we just talked about relative to our ability to price within our 1% to 2% algorithm. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : So just two quick ones for me. On the -- Garth, on the beer margin outlook, you gave a lot of great detail. I guess, you\u2019re looking for flat operating margins for the year. Is there any way -- or flattish. Is there any way to frame expectations for gross margin relative to operating margin? And I say that in the context of productivity initiatives, which I suppose can play out in both line items. So I was just curious if you have any comment there. The second observation is Wine and Spirits just delivered what I think is the best operating margin in a few years. And yet the outlook would imply that you\u2019re giving a lot of that back. So is that just conservatism, or is there something just missing in the bridge about some of this nice premiumization, which has really helped the margin structure there? And I sort of asked that in the context of prior margin targets for the Wine and Spirits business in general. So, thanks for those two on Beer margins and Wine and Spirits margins. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So, on the Wine and Spirits margins -- and so again, I\u2019ll reference you to the deck that will be posted to our website after this call. But we\u2019re actually forecasting wine margins to increase by at least 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And so, you\u2019ll be able to see that detail on the website. As it relates to operating margin -- or gross profit margin with beer, I mean, all of the headwinds that we\u2019re facing really in beer this coming year will be in gross margin and not below the line. As we said, we\u2019ll continue to -- we\u2019ll continue to effectively manage our marketing and SG&A spend and focus on the highest return and highest priority initiatives, and we\u2019ll manage that effectively. So, the largest drag for us, as we\u2019ve said for the last several months now, it\u2019s going to just be the inflationary impact. Again, we\u2019ll hit through COGS as well as some incremental depreciation throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Nadine Sarwat : So just coming back to the beer margin point, if I take the midpoint up your beer guidance for top line and operating income, it comes a touch below your initial 38 that I think you discussed. Was there anything in particular that changed to the downside versus your previous commentary, or I mean, is this just a situation of rounding here? And then just a follow-up on the margin point, given the margins of last year and what we\u2019ll be seeing on the back of your guidance for this fiscal year. Should we still be thinking about 39% to 40% as your medium-term margin for the business? And would it be fair to [Technical Difficulty] 25? Garth Hankinson : So, we do apologize because you broke there at the end\u2026 Bill Newlands : I think the back end of that was do we expect to get there in fiscal \u201825. You broke up, I apologize, but I think that\u2019s what said. So go ahead. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So I think as you\u2019re working with the numbers that we provided, when we said 38% operating -- approximately 38% operating margin. So that if you kind of look at the various points within our range, you\u2019ll come up with various different outputs as it relates to what the margin will be. So we fully -- we have full conviction that we\u2019re going to deliver operating margins for our beer business on approximately 38%. As it relates to the outlook going forward, we\u2019ve just provided our outlook -- our margin outlook for our beer business for FY24. We\u2019re not providing any guidance for future years. We typically don\u2019t do that at this point. That\u2019s not part of our process. Certainly, the biggest driver again this year that we have for FY24 is again driven predominantly by inflation and the inflation that we\u2019re seeing, which I outlined in my scripts as well as some incremental depreciation. Offsetting that, we\u2019ll continue to take pricing as we have. And as we\u2019ve said earlier, we\u2019ll be -- pricing in our 1% to 2% range. We continue to drive incremental volume, which helps to offset fixed overheads and depreciation as we grow into our expanded footprint, and we\u2019ll continue on with the efficiency drivers that I mentioned as well. So, that\u2019s where we stand for FY24, and we\u2019ll talk about FY25 as we -- closer to the end of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I wanted to touch -- just move back to Wine and Spirits. And maybe Garth, could you talk a little bit about how and SVEDKA and Woodbridge are affecting margin and maybe margin progression there? And I guess I ask in the context of they\u2019re a much larger contributor to volume than they are to revenue. And I guess my assumption is the margins are lower than the average. So just trying to understand, is getting volume stabilization or volume growth in those 2 brands an important component sort of building margins there, or is that not really a big factor? So, really just trying to understand Woodbridge and SVEDKA and kind of the longer-term impact on profitability in Wine and Spirits? Garth Hankinson : Yes. Well, you\u2019re absolutely correct that given the size of those brands that they do have a bit of a drag on our overall margin profile, given the price points in which they compete and therefore, their margin profile, which is below the average profile for the entire business unit. On a positive note, the Wine and Spirits team has pretty aggressive revitalization plans in place for both of those brands so that we can stabilize those brands and continue to outperform the price segments that they participate in. And as such, as we continue to make those efficiency improvements, we certainly -- and revitalize those brands, we expect that we\u2019ll be able to achieve our margin targets as laid out. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Thanks very much. Fiscal \u201823 was a big year for Constellation Brands. We achieved record net sales and comparable operating income and were recognized for the tenth year as a CPG growth leader, despite some of the most significant inflationary headwinds affecting our company and consumers in recent history. Our beer business outperformed our initial expectations and continued to lead in share gains, growth and margins. Despite some volatility across the year as we lapped distortions in our performance from prior periods and navigating incremental pricing actions beyond our annual algorithm intended to offset cost pressures across the chain. And we delivered many other transformational milestones, including our transition to a single share class structure and other important corporate governance enhancements. The start of our construction activities at our new brewery site in Veracruz, and some additional refinement of our Wine and Spirits portfolio as well as continued progress against the strategy of that business. Lastly, the performance of our business, coupled with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities allowed us to maintain our investment-grade rating, despite the incremental financing associated with the transaction for our transition to a single share price structure to surpass our share repurchases and dividend cash returns goal by over 400 million and continuing to grow our beer production capacity while executing small growth accretive M&A. As we look forward to fiscal \u201824, we remain focused on delivering sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders through the execution of our annual plan and by continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. And we are confident in our ability to continue building momentum across our bigger portfolio and strong volume growth and targeted pricing actions. We are bullish on the future performance of our Wine and Spirits business as it continues to advance its strategy, and we are committed to our capital allocation priorities and our ESG efforts. Thanks again, everyone, for joining the call. We hope you will choose to enjoy your Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day celebrations with some of our great products, and we look forward to speaking with all of you in late June on our next quarterly call. Thank you very much, and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Suarez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, all, and welcome again to Constellation Brands' Q1 fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll once again be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person as noted, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2024, with a solid first quarter. Our Beer Business delivered net sales growth of 11%, mainly driven by continued strong volume growth in line with our medium-term algorithm. As anticipated, depletion performance accelerated throughout the quarter, resulting in a 5.5% increase for the period and acceleration that has continued into June, supported by our beer team's unrelenting push to increase distribution for our high-growth, high-velocity brands, continued incremental investments in marketing focused on the highest return opportunities and ongoing strong demand for our high-end Mexican beer brands aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends. Particularly in large markets with significant runway for Modelo Especial, like Texas, Florida, Illinois and North Carolina with the brand posted double-digit dollar sales growth in Circana track channels. And yes, also in California, where our share gains actually accelerated and as expected, demand for our portfolio did ramp up after the unseasonably cold weather in early March. All in, our Beer Business delivered strong growth for the quarter, while consistently advancing all four areas of our strategic initiatives. First, the business continued to propel its powerful core brands that people love. Modelo Especial remained the number one dollar share gainer in the entire beer category, delivered double-digit dollar sales growth in tracked channels, and as most of you likely already are aware, became the number one beer in America in dollar sales during the first quarter. Both Corona Extra and Pacifico also achieved share gains and delivered dollar sales growth of approximately 4% and 26%, respectively. Second, our beer innovations, which are still centered around the flavor and betterment consumer-led trends are off to a great start. Our Modelo Chelada brands remained a top 10 dollar share gainer with further support from our variety pack launched last year, the number four new product in Circana channels and from the launch of new Sand\u00eda Picante flavor, the number five new brand. Modelo Oro was also a top 10 share gainer and incrementally has actually been slightly above what we saw in initial test markets. And Corona NA was the number one share gainer in the non-alcoholic beer category in tracked channels. Third, the expansions of our beer brewing capacity continued to advance as planned. Our latest modular addition to Obregon successfully ramped up in Q1 and we are on track with the new ABA facility at Nava for Q4 of this fiscal year. At Veracruz, site development and construction work are underway, and we expect that to build up through this year and next. And fourth, the ESG efforts of our Beer Business further drove progress on our company-wide goals, particularly those on water stewardship. As noted in our last call, we recently surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local water sheds. The initiatives in our Beer Business drove most of this achievement, and we plan to announce a new water target later this fiscal year. Building on our existing water and emissions targets, we also recently announced two new commitments focused on reducing waste and enhancing our use of circular packaging. In support of that commitment, within our Beer Business, we plan to attain a true zero waste to landfill certification for our breweries in Mexico and replace hi-cone plastic rings with recyclable paperboard for all applicable four and six pack SKUs. Similarly, within our Wine and Spirits Business, we also plan to attain the same certification for our key U.S. operations, as well as reducing our packaging to product weight ratio by 10% and ensure that 80% of the business packaging is returnable, recyclable or renewable. With that, let's turn more fully to our Wine and Spirits Business. As noted previously, over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has strategically shifted its portfolio to a bold, innovative and higher-end product mix that continues to be driven by consumer-led premiumization. In Q1, the higher-end wine portion of the business gained share in the U.S. wine category and outpaced the dollar sales growth of the corresponding segment and tracked channels. Meiomi and Kim Crawford, the portfolio's largest premium wine brands and The Prisoner Wine Company, the largest fine wine brand group were main drivers of this strong performance. The innovation efforts across these brands also continued to deliver excellent results with Meiomi Bright, the brand's lower alcohol, lower calorie offering aligned with consumer-led betterment trend capturing the number one new brand spot in the category. In the main streamline portion of the business, the reinvention of Woodbridge is underway to address the growth headwinds and facing that segment of the category while keeping the brand's core consumers engaged. And while there is certainly more work to be done here, the brand's year-over-year dollar sales decline in U.S. tracked channels improved throughout the quarter. The overall spirits portfolio maintained its share in U.S. tracked channels with notably strong dollar sales performance across its higher-end tequila and RTD products. In particular, Mi Campo tequila and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, both delivered significant double-digit dollar sales growth. Beyond the evolution of the portfolio over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has also been investing in capabilities to accelerate its performance in key growth channels. This omni-channel focus has provided additional pillars of consumer-led growth such as international and direct-to-consumer. The latter of which grew the channel's net sales 13% in Q1. And in fact, the e-commerce and customer loyalty portions of our DT business - DTC business, pardon me, were up over 40% in Q1. From a volume perspective, the Wine and Spirits Business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends noted earlier, which in turn affected top line performance. In the higher end line portion of our portfolio, our larger premium and luxury brands faced softer segment demand in April, but we did see solid acceleration in May, and that has continued into June. Meanwhile, in our spirits portfolio, our higher-end craft brands posted very strong depletion growth of 40%. The Wine and Spirits Business also delivered significant operating margin expansion in Q1, adjusted for the contribution after marketing of the divested brands. This further demonstrates the benefits of the strategic refocusing of the portfolio to higher end, higher growth, higher-margin brands and channels. To sum up the shift of the Wine and Spirits Business toward driving growth and margin improvement through its pivot to the higher-end brands and broader channels and markets, remains well on track. All in, we are confident in our outlook for the Wine and Spirits Business in fiscal 2024 as performance is expected to continue to accelerate throughout the course of the year, in line with seasonality and the business' annual plan, particularly as the share of net sales from our Aspira, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits portfolio increases over the coming quarter. In closing, I once more want to highlight that our solid performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was anchored by the consistent execution of the annual plans and strategic initiatives across both businesses. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review in more detail our financial results for the quarter. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, fiscal 2024 is off to a solid start. We steadily executed against our annual plans, remaining both focused and adaptable as the economic and consumer backdrop continue to evolve and we remain on track to deliver against our stated financial performance goals for this fiscal year. As Bill noted, our Beer Business achieved double-digit net sales growth and the higher-end segment of our Wine and Spirits Business outperformed the higher end of the wine category. We also continue to execute and deliver against our capital allocation priorities, and we are reiterating our guidance for the year. Now, let's review our Q1 fiscal 2024 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the Beer Business. Net sales increased by $200 million representing an uplift of 11%. This was driven primarily by our volume growth of 7.5% as strong demand continued across our industry-leading portfolio. We also benefited from favorable pricing, which contributed $60 million of the overall net sales increase. Staying on the topic of price for just a moment, the incremental pricing we realized this quarter primarily reflects the wraparound impact from the elevated pricing taken in fiscal 2023 that was above our typical 1% to 2% algorithm. As a reminder, we expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year, which represents the combined uplift from the wraparound impact and the average of any other additional pricing actions to be taken in fiscal 2024 on a market-by-market, channel-by-channel and SKU-by-SKU basis. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 5.5%, which reflects a slower start but strong finish in the three-month period between March and May as growth significantly accelerated through the quarter, driven by the disciplined execution of our distribution and marketing plans, including during the key Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays, ongoing consumer led premiumization trends including solid buy rates for high-end beer. And as Bill noted, significant growth in several of our top five markets and beyond as well as improving conditions in California. These results give us confidence as we head into the peak summer selling season. Our largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra delivered mid-single-digit and low single-digit depletion growth, respectively. While our emerging brands, the Modelo Chelada brands and Pacifico each delivered double-digit depletion growth. On-premise depletions grew 3.2% and accounted for approximately 12.4% of total volume, reflecting more normalized year-over-year performance following the distortions caused by the pandemic closures and post-pandemic reopenings. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, shipment volume ran slightly ahead of the depletion volume on an absolute basis. Shipments were in line with our plan throughout the quarter, and depletions ultimately ramped up over the course of the three months, as previously noted. This difference in timing was the primary driver of the variance between shipment and depletion volumes. Additionally, as it has been the case historically, strong shipment volume in the first quarter also reflects inventory preparations with distributors and retailers for the peak busy summer season. That said, distributor inventories remain at normal seasonal levels, so we do not expect this variance to generate any further distortion in Q2 and expect both shipment and depletion volume to be aligned for the full fiscal year. Importantly, we also \u2013 we are also well-equipped with capacity flexibility to meet any incremental demand as we move through the year. In regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter. Please note that for fiscal 2024, there will be one more selling day in Q4. Moving on to beer margins. Operating margin decreased by 220 basis points to 38%. This decrease was primarily driven by continued inflationary headwinds in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 4% for the quarter. As anticipated in our guidance for the year, we continue to face higher packaging and raw materials, freight and overhead costs. In Q1, we experienced low double-digit percent increases in packaging and raw materials as inflationary pressures continued throughout the period, albeit at a declining rate over the three months. We also continue to face higher overhead costs related to our brewery expansion as well as increased logistics costs, largely related to higher shipment volumes. As we have previously stated, it is important to note that for fiscal 2024 and consistent with recent years, roughly 70% of our COGS are subject to annual pricing adjustments. These are based on trailing indicators, such as producer price indices and, therefore, typically reflect inflation from the preceding year. The remaining 30% of COGS are subject to fluctuations throughout the year and we can manage the volatility for about half of that 30% through our multi-year hedging program. Will our full year COGS expectations currently remain unchanged, we are monitoring closely any potential favorability in direct commodity and pass-through raw material prices for the approximately 15% non-hedged portion still subject to intra-year adjustments and will provide any relevant updates in future quarters. Additional operating margin headwinds for the beer business were comprised of a $29 million or 17% increase in marketing expense, primarily driven by ongoing media spend to build awareness of our core products as well as recent investments to support the new Modelo Oro product launch and as a result, please note that marketing as a percent of net sales came in at 9.5% for the quarter. A $15 million or 18% increase in SG&A expense which was primarily the result of increased legal costs and an $11 million or 16% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments. To help offset the increase in cost to our Beer Business, we are executing on various levers to partially offset the full year high single-digit inflationary headwinds in our overall packaging, raw materials and logistics costs through productivity initiatives. These initiatives have yielded savings of over $30 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and are focused on unlocking efficiencies and cost savings across procurement, operations and supply chain. For fiscal 2024, our guidance for the Beer Business remains unchanged as we continue to target 7% to 9% of net sales growth and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, implying an operating margin of approximately 38%. Now moving on to the Wine and Spirits Business. As Bill noted, over the last few years, our Wine and Spirits Business has been effectively shifting its portfolio to be more focused on higher-end brands that are better aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends while broadening sales channels to also expand into higher growth avenues. To that effect, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our portfolio during our third quarter in fiscal 2023. Accordingly, during today's discussion, I will be referring to the top line of the Wine and Spirits Business on an organic basis, which excludes the contribution from the divested brands. Consistent with the strategic transformation, the Wine and Spirits Business has undertaken the higher-end brands of the wine portfolio continue to resonate with the consumer and outperformed the corresponding segment of the category in the U.S. tracked channels in Q1. More recently, we've seen even greater strength in our three largest premium and fine wine brand families with Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company, showing dollar sales growth and acceleration in tracked channels. Similarly, we were also pleased to see the overall spirits portfolio deliver strong dollar sales growth in tracked channels led by Mi CAMPO, and High West ready-to-drink cocktails. However, Wine and Spirits organic net sales were down 6%, largely as a result of the continued impact of ongoing consumer-led premiumization affecting the entire category and the lapping of a particularly strong prior year first quarter for our higher-end brands due to distributor inventory balancing actions. From a channel perspective, we continue to see success through our direct-to-consumer efforts, which delivered 13% net sales growth in our overall DTC channel. While still small compared to the rest of our Wine and Spirits Business, this channel accounted for 4% of total net sales, an increase of 100% versus just a few years ago. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by 9% and depletions decreased by approximately 6%. As noted earlier, this volume decline was primarily driven by our mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA, as their respective segments of the categories face ongoing growth headwinds driven by consumer-led premiumization. Again, the Wine and Spirits Business continues to diligently work on the reinvention of Woodbridge and SVEDKA to address these headwinds. In particular, SVEDKA declines have stabilized, and we continue to look at incremental opportunities to revitalize the brand and accelerate improvements. And more broadly, in our spirits portfolio, our craft brands posted nearly 40% depletion growth driven by Mi CAMPO, posting depletion growth of over 80%. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture were relatively flat, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 19%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the favorable impact of the pricing actions taken last year that primarily focused on our higher-end brands, lower materials and packaging costs, including great blend optimization, lapping of higher freight and warehousing costs and lower marketing expense as we have streamlined our approach to marketing, focusing on the highest return areas of our portfolio. Looking ahead, we expect the performance of the Wine and Spirits Business to accelerate throughout the remainder of the fiscal year through the combination of increased growth contribution from the portfolio's higher end brands, which are already seeing depletions improve in line with our sales efforts and seasonal trends, ongoing growth in DTC channels as well as a return to growth in international markets. Lower marketing spend as we shift towards higher growth areas, focusing on the Aspira portfolio, and continued work toward a revitalization of SVEDKA and Woodbridge in the mainstream category. Accordingly, we remain confident in the outlook for Wine and Spirits, for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal 2024 remains unchanged. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Starting with corporate expense, which for the quarter was approximately $50 million from SG&A and overall corporate expense reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year and $33 million from unconsolidated investments related to Canopy and our Ventures portfolio investments. The overall corporate expense reduction is primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program. I want to take a moment to talk briefly about the next wave of our digital business acceleration program. For fiscal 2024, our DBA program will have three main goals : first, scaling our prior year's focus areas of marketing, procurement and supply chain across the business; second, introducing a new focus area, logistics, which will center around improving end-to-end visibility, and planning as well as enhancing our network capabilities across the business; and third, reducing third-party consulting fees as we begin to shift the support of our DBA program to in-house, increasing efficiencies and reducing overall cost. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $118 million. This is a 34% increase from the prior year driven by higher average borrowings and rising interest rates on approximately 10% of our debt with adjustable rates. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times excluding Canopy equity and earnings and expect to continue to make progress towards our approximately 3 times ratio target throughout the year. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 20.7% versus 20.6% last year. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we generated free cash flow of $388 million, a 31% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 41% increase in CapEx investments driven primarily by the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. Our capacity expansions are underway as planned. Of the planned additions for this year, we fully ramped up 5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility in Q1 and are planning on another 5 million hectoliters to support our ABA production to be online at our Nava facility towards the end of fiscal 2024. In total, by the end of fiscal 2024, we expect to have about 52 million hectoliters of capacity online, which, as you recall, includes nearly 3 million hectoliters of additional capacity from operational efficiency initiatives executed last fiscal year. Looking ahead, as we continue to consider incremental operational opportunities for our production facilities, we will seek to ensure that we align our additional modular capacity expansions to the timing that best balances both any further enhancements to our existing production footprint and our expectations for continued strong demand for our brands. Turning to cash flow. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.04 with an announced dividend of $0.89, bringing our dividend payout ratio to approximately 30% for the quarter. Our fiscal 2024 EPS comparable guidance of $11.70 to $12 remains unchanged. In closing, we believe that this solid start to fiscal 2024 sets us up for a great year ahead. We delivered net sales and volume growth in our Beer Business while implementing cost savings and efficiencies to help counteract the continued inflationary headwinds we face. Our Wine and Spirits Business is honing in on becoming a multichannel global competitor primarily focused on the higher end segment. The growth in our core businesses and execution against our strategies makes us enthusiastic about what the rest of the year will bring and the shareholder value we will be able to create. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Dara Mohsenian : Hi guys. Bill Newlands : Hi Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, you sounded pretty bullish about beer depletions towards the end of fiscal Q1 in May and June so far. I was just hoping for a little more detail there. And more specifically, if you can sort of juxtapose that versus the slowdown we have seen in the November to April timeframe. It does seem like a fairly sizable inflection in the other way. So, more detail there would be helpful. And just if these factors driving the better May and June look more extendable and how you think about that? And if I can slip in a second part that I'll pretend is related to the first part, just if industry pricing worsens going forward, given there's obviously a lot of potential changes on the ABI side, how do you think about domestic beer pricing as sort of the risk factor to your volume trends as you look going forward, if, in fact, there's any change from an industry backdrop standpoint? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure Dara. Let me cover that one. As we have told you before, March was a particularly challenging month. But as we've also noted, there was great acceleration. I think the easiest way to look at it is to look at Circana data. The 12-week is better than the 26th week. The 4-week is better than the 12-week. And as I noted this morning, the acceleration that we saw coming out of the first quarter is continuing into the second quarter, which I think is very positive. To give you some other perspective that I think would be important and I think people often ask, if you think about Modelo Especial, we had 24 states in the first quarter growing double-digits. In our Chelada business, we had 47 states grow double or triple-digits during the first quarter. And as we've already noted, those things were accelerating coming out of the quarter. So, I think we're quite comfortable that the largely challenging issues that we faced in sort of that winter time period are now behind us, and we're looking forward to a very strong summer period. Relative to your question about pricing, we haven't seen any particular challenges around pricing. In fact, as we run our normal drivers and drags, the effect of pricing has actually decreased in our business as we've gone through the early part of this year. As we've noted other times, we have not seen much trade down at all away from our business and believe that trend is likely to continue, given the strong consumer engagement with all of our brands. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now live. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about on-premise trends, the depletion call out of 3%. It seems as a pretty deceleration versus Q1. So, maybe you just talk specifically to what you've been seeing in terms of on-premise trends later in the quarter? And if you've been talking about this acceleration, in our \u2013 excuse me in Circana data, that also applies to the on-premise. Thanks. Bill Newlands : Lauren, on-premise is still not quite back to where we saw pre-pandemic. As we've said before, it was roughly 15% of our business pre-pandemic, and it's still in that 12% to 13% range, as we have come out of the pandemic. And it's probably been a little more volatile, the hit and miss compared to what you see in tracked channels. We believe it's going to continue to do well, and it's going to continue to improve over the course of the summer, as we put the final touches hopefully on the pandemic behind us, but it's admittedly not back to quite where it was ahead of time. The thing that we've often been very pleased about is we've seen many accounts in the on-premise get much more focused on well-known recognized brands. And obviously, whenever that happens, it's to our advantage because of the strength of those brands. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Your line is now live. Peter Grom : Thanks operator and good morning everyone. So I kind of wanted to ask about beer margins, maybe two-parts here. Maybe first, I think marketing was up almost 17% this quarter. And I think the expectation in the initial guidance was for a low single-digit increase for marketing for the year. So I guess, how should we think about the phasing of marketing spend moving forward? And I guess has the outlook changed at all, given the high-teens increase in one or two? And then just related, you mentioned that monitoring some favorability across some of your key inputs and we'll provide an update later. But I guess, conceptually, should there be any capability in those in would you anticipate those benefits dropping to the bottom-line? Or would you look to take out marketing further? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Well, thanks for the question. I mean, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the increase in Q1 marketing spend was largely supportive of the momentum behind our existing products as well as the support of the launch behind Modelo Oro. So marketing as a percent of net sales for the quarter came in at 9.5%. The outlook for the full year is unchanged. We will continue to spend in our normal algorithm, that 9% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis. And so again, nothing changed in that regard. As it relates to some of the improvement that we're seeing, obviously, we're off of some of the highs from a commodity perspective, with the exception of one or two things that have continued to be a little bit - they haven't quite come off their highs just yet. So we do think that there could be some favorability as we move through the year on the commodity side. However, some of that favorability could be offset with the strength of the peso. If we look at the outlook right now, the favorability we're seeing on some commodities is being somewhat or completely offset by the strength of the peso. So right now, we're not seeing necessarily when you take into account the peso and the improving commodity market, but we're not necessarily seeing a big change for the balance of the year. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Bryan Spillane : Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me, Garth. I think back on the 4Q call, when you talked about cadence, it was 55% of your volume first half and 55% of Wine and Spirits in the back half. So just wanted to see if that was still directionally kind of where we should be thinking as we're beginning to kind of restack our models for the balance of the year. Garth Hankinson : Yes, Bryan, absolutely. No changes in that. And obviously, that's one of the reasons why we think wine will continue to improve through the year. And again, no change that - the Beer business is pretty seasonal and tried and true. So that's absolutely what the outlook is for the Beer Business. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I guess I had a question about the Bud Light issue and how it may be impacting your business as well as your distributors? And any changes you might be making there? And then also in light of this, wondering if there might be an opportunity for you to possibly secure more tap handles from Modelo, just thinking about the on-prem business. And then just finally, any changes that you might be making to your marketing strategy or possibly spend levels in light of all of this. Thanks. Bill Newlands : Well, obviously, the single biggest change that we've seen, Bonnie has been that Modelo has taken over as the number one beer by dollars in the U.S. We - Jim Sabia has often said that, that was going to happen in the next few years. But obviously, it happened a little sooner than we had anticipated. I think one of the things that you're likely to see if some of that challenge continues is when we look at shelf sets in the back half of the year. Many retailers look at velocities as they are doing their re-shelf setting, which, again, often happens in the fall. And that always works to our advantage. I think when you - the retailing environment has gotten very, very sophisticated about seeing where the growth profiles are and the velocities against those. We're particularly excited in our Beer business, the fact that the buy rate, both on our core as well as our high-end beer, including the Hispanic consumer, went up year-on-year during the first quarter. I think that's going to continue to be positive for us, and I think it's going to help us accelerate expansion of shelf and again, some of that is coming because of the growth and velocities that you're seeing on our brands, but also the decrease that you've seen, as you know, from some of our competitors. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Your line is now live. Nadine Sarwat : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned some commentary at the start on Oro. I'd be keen to get a little bit more color there in terms of either repeat rates, cannibalizations and feedback from consumers now that it's been out in the market for a while. Thank you. Bill Newlands : You bet, Nadine. It is - the incrementality on the actual market has been better, a slight bit better than what we had anticipated coming out of our test markets. And we are quite pleased with it in the test markets. So we're getting very good response on that. It is already a top 10 share gainer, as I noted in my prepared remarks. And again, we've done this with, I would say, a careful approach. We only have two SKUs in that particular product at this point in time. Recognizing, as Garth pointed out in his remarks, should that continue to show the positive signs that it has to-date, we do have the capacity now to more aggressively go after that as the year continues, which I think, again, is very, very positive and speaks to the success that we've had in our operations in Mexico of creating some ability to go beyond what our initial plans are when those opportunities present themselves. But it's early days. I don't like to get too far over my skis too soon on any new product introduction. But so far, this is going at least according to plan, if not better, and we're very pleased with the incrementality that we're seeing. As I said, it's slightly better than we saw in our test markets. So, all thumbs up for us at this point on that product. Nadine Sarwat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to the marketing spend. I think you've mentioned for the year the 7% to 9% of the top line, you started well with 9%. So I was just hoping to reconcile, because you also said you expect it to be up to low-single. I mean not questioning, I think it's probably a great thing to start well, especially now with this commentary about, obviously, what's happening with Bud Light. And then related to - just a clarification on a bit on the gross margin side. And I think, Garth, you mentioned that obviously, you've got $30 million of cost benefit for savings. You also have some benefits from packaging. Is that - I believe we all in this call, we\u2019re pleased to margins the way they came through for beer. So can you comment on a little bit what the lag room? Do you feel even more confident with your guide being conservative as the way I see it? Thank you. Bill Newlands : So let me take the first half, and I'll let Garth take the second half of that. Our marketing approach has been consistent for years. That's one of the things that we think has been tremendous for our brands and why they continue to accelerate in the market. We believe in spending against our brands. We have refined it some. We're getting much more capable in the digital arena than what we were just a few years ago. And I think that's very positive. But we have the number one share of voice in the market and we expect to continue to be - to have that continue going forward. And we believe in it. It's shown tremendous success for our brands as we've gotten to this point, and we believe it's going to be an important part of our continued success moving forward. Garth, I'll let you answer the other, if you would. Garth Hankinson : Yes. On the margin front, look, I mean the 38% for the quarter was roughly in line, maybe slightly better than what our expectations were as we entered the year. We certainly feel confident in our ability to deliver the margin profile that we laid out at the beginning of the year. As I said in my prepared remarks, and as we reminded everyone in the last quarter, roughly 70% of our total COGS are subject to annual adjustments that are backward looking and only 30% have any fluctuation, are exposed to fluctuations throughout the year. And so again, we feel really good about the position that we're in right now, and our ability to deliver the margin profile that's consistent with the - with our earnings guidance. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. Just one clarification and then a question on Wine and Spirits. Just the clarification, Garth, you said that you didn't expect any distortion in shipments versus depletions going forward after Q1. And I think you were clear in response to Bryan's question about the mix of cases front half or back half but should the rate of growth of shipments be below the rate of growth of depletions in Q2 or any quarter go forward? And basically, what I'm trying to clarify here is the absolute cases versus the rate of change. So I would just give a clarification then. The question on Wine and Spirits would be - can you just perhaps just suppose the premiumization efforts with the margin delivery in the quarter and perhaps just reaffirm confidence in a way on the margin trajectory of the Wine and Spirits business go forward here? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yes. So, on the shipments and depletions. So look, as we said, we expect the shipments and depletions to be on a nominal basis to be largely in line with one another on a full year basis. I think if you look and you go back to the years that are unaffected by the pandemic or weather-related operational difficulties, you'll see that there is some seasonal differences between depletions and shipments. Q1, as we noted, we typically do have some outpacing of shipments relative to depletions on a nominal basis as you're building for the summer season. So - and you're getting distributors and retailers in a position that they're able to meet the demand of that key summer selling season. So that's fairly typical. So I would just ask you to go back and look at some prior periods, again, pre-pandemic. As it relates to our Wine and Spirits Business, again, as we said on the call, we do expect to see continued improvement through the year on the margin front as we continue to see increased traction with our premium portfolio. Again, we're seeing good growth on brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and The Prisoner Wine Company. We're continuing to get the benefit of pricing on those. And there are a number of cost initiatives underway in our wine business. As well as seeing improvements there, as we said, on both logistics and on great input costs. So again, that's a business also that, as Bryan noted, we've guided will - the volume there is about 55 back end loaded. So, for all of those reasons, we're confident that we can deliver the year and deliver the margin profile that we previously guided to. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Your line is now live. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. A quick question on the health of the U.S. consumer, particularly, if you look about your core Hispanic consumer base, any changes that you see in terms of purchasing behaviors, in terms of package size, trade down or any signs of that? And clearly, your business has improved as the weather improved in California. But any signs there also in terms of changing consumer behaviors, particularly again, in the Hispanic consumer base in the states? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yes. As you can imagine, that's something that we track very carefully as well. And we're pleased to report that the buy rate, which again is trips times the spend for high-end beer, and this includes the Hispanic consumer was up year-on-year in the first quarter. It's one we track very carefully. It's an important element to us. And it's one that we are very pleased to see in a positive vein. As you point out, we have continued to see acceleration of our share in California, which is an important market during the course of the first quarter as well. And in that particular market, as you would expect, the Hispanic consumer base is very important to us. It's also very important, for instance, in the state of Texas, which saw a double-digit growth profile in the first quarter as well. So we're pretty comfortable that the consumer side of our business remains very strong. And as I noted on the prior call from the prior question, excuse me, that we are continuing to invest heavily against our marketing approach to make sure that we continue to maintain that same consumer demand that we've enjoyed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you for taking the question. My question is around opportunities around price pack architecture as a beer volume growth driver. And I guess what I'm hoping is you can help us understand exactly where you are in that process? Is that something that over the medium-term we should expect to accelerate as a contributor and maybe over the next 12 months versus over the medium-term, where the focus is within that strategy? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Yes. You're entirely right, Andrew. That's something that our beer leadership team is working on aggressively day in and day out. And frankly, we think we can learn a lot from some other players in the beverage arena, particularly in the soda area, where pretty much if you tell me what you've got to spend, there's a pack size or a pack appropriate for a particular price point. So a lot of things we are looking at, things like Modelo, we're looking at different quantities, ounce quantities against some of our packaging. So all of these things are critically important. Part of the reason you're seeing the massive acceleration in the high 40 percentile in the Chelada business, is what used to be only a 24-ounce can is now available in both multi-pack and 12-ounce opportunities. So again, we think \u2013 and that's been part of the big acceleration in the Chelada area. So this is an area that we're spending a lot of time on ourselves to make sure that whatever the consumer has available to spend against our brand, that we have something available to them within our portfolio to make sure that they can take our products home with them when they leave a store. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bill for any further or closing comments. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Kevin, and thank you all for joining today's call. We're off to an excellent start in fiscal 2024. Our Beer Business delivered strong growth for the quarter with performance accelerating since the beginning of the year and into Q2. The higher-end brands of our Wine and Spirits portfolio continued to outperform and track channels and to drive margin improvement. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year and are building great momentum as we head into the key summer selling season for our Beer Business and the seasonally stronger second half for the Wine and Spirits Business. In closing, I want to wish you all a happy fourth of July for those of you celebrating that and hope you choose to enjoy your celebrations with some of our great products. Thanks again, everyone, and have a great summer. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 fiscal '24 call. In terms of key headlines for the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that our team once again delivered solid overall performance. First of all, our beer business led to charge as the number one share gainer with accelerating shares across the key summer holiday. We continue to invest in growth for this business as our team looks to seize opportunities to gain incremental awareness, shelf space, in household penetration for our brands in the back half and beyond. Secondly, our Wine and Spirits Business continues to progress along its journey to realize the full benefits of its transformation. Prioritized investments in our largest Wine and Spirits higher-end brands are yielding outperformance in their respective categories, while partially offsetting and helping to reduce headwinds from our mainstream brands as they continue to shift the mix profile of our portfolio. And third, our continued discipline around capital allocation priorities contributed to a strong overall performance in the quarter and sets the stage for fiscal '24, being another solid year of profitable growth and shareholder returns.  That said, let me provide a little more color around our key performance drivers in the quarter. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Not only did we remain the top share gainer over the entire critical summer season, we also extended our leading position from Cinco de Mayo to become the number one share gainer in tracked channels during the 4th of July holiday, and although, it falls slightly after our second quarter-end. I'm also pleased to report that we further accelerated our share gains during Labor Day. Modelo Especial remained the key driver of our strong performance, achieving double-digit volume growth in tracked channels and an 8.6% increase in depletions, ultimately strengthening its position as the top brand across the entire U.S. beer market and dollar sales fiscal year-to-date. The broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results, with Cheladas achieving 50% volume growth in tracked channels and an increase in depletions of over 40%, while Oro continues to build on a solid launch, increasing its share gains in the overall beer category and performing in line with our plans for the fiscal year. Beyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico core beer brands also continued to perform strongly. Corona Extra delivered solid low single-digit growth in depletions and tracked channel volumes and was the number six share gainer in the category, while Pacifico achieved 15% depletion growth tracked channel volume growth of approximately 27% and was the number 11 top share gainer in tracked channels. Our beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer, driving demand for our brands in the second quarter, which supported double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business. This gives us confidence to shift our fiscal \u201824 net sales and operating income guidance for the beer business to the higher end of our initial ranges that is 8% to 9% and 6% to 7% growth, respectively. That said, it is important to remember that for our beer business, we indicated that only 45% of total volume for the fiscal year will be shipped in the second half, which aligns with the regular seasonality of beer demand in the U.S. and the timing of our brewery maintenance activities. Beyond fiscal \u201824, we continue to see significant opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of our beer business, particularly due to the resilience of key secular trends in the consumer landscape like ongoing consumer-led premiumization across beverage alcohol and the continued outsized growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S. as well as the relentless focus of our beer business on closing the distribution and awareness gaps that still exist across our brands and on developing and scaling new and exciting products aligned with consumer-led trends. We look forward to sharing more details on this compelling outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on November 2. Moving on to Wine and Spirits. Our Wine and Spirits business continues to make headway on its vision to become a bold and innovative higher-end market leader. In the second quarter, our largest premium wine brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford outperformed their corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels. They both increased their respective share in the overall line category. Our largest Fine Wine & Craft Spirits brands, the Prisoner Wine Company and our Mi Campo tequila brand also outperformed their corresponding luxury wine and higher-end spirits category segments. Notably, all of the individual brands just referenced also delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter. Our Wine and Spirits business also continues to advance the renovation of its mainstream brands to address the headwinds to corresponding category segments at faced over several recent quarters. While there is certainly more work to be done here, in U.S. tracked channels, the year-over-year dollar sales decline for Woodbridge improved relative to the first quarter and SVEDKA's overall share remained relatively stable when compared to the first quarter. All of that said, our Wine and Spirits business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends noted in prior occasions, which in turn affected overall performance in the second quarter. Nevertheless, we are reiterating guidance for the full year and continue to expect fiscal '24 organic net sales to remain relatively stable and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. As we shared when we provided our outlook for fiscal '24, we see the year as a tale of two halves for the wine and spirits business, with 55% of planned volume is being delivered in the second half and operating performance projected to accelerate over the rest of the year due to other key factors. We expect to benefit from the more proactive quarterly shipment and depletion rebalancing actions we have undertaken this year versus our single downward shipment adjustment in Q4 of last year. We also anticipate an uplift in our direct-to-consumer channels and improved mix from incremental ASPIRA shipments in line with seasonality, as well as benefits from recent price increases. Ultimately, we also expect to see operating margins meaningfully accelerate due to the improved sales trends just described and the resulting positive operating leverage. Before I conclude, it would be remiss not to highlight our consistent execution against our capital allocation priorities. We continue to make progress towards our reduced net leverage ratio of approximately 3 times with a 400 basis point reduction since the increase resulting from the financing of our Class B common stock reclassification last November. Importantly, our proactive management of the incremental debt from the reclassification now puts us on track to deliver lower interest expense than initially anticipated for fiscal \u201824. And in turn, we now anticipate higher reported and comparable earnings per share, excluding Canopy, in the ranges of $9.60 to $9.80 and $12.00 to $12.20, respectively, for the full year. In terms of cash returns to our shareholders, our dividend payout ratio for the second quarter remained aligned with our 30% target. While we did not conduct any additional share repurchases in Q2, we have executed $35 million year-to-date in line with our goal to at least offset dilution. Lastly, our brewery expansions are progressing as planned, including Veracruz, and we continue to develop and bring these online with the flexibility enabled by our modular approach. Before I conclude, I also want to again take an opportunity during our second quarter call to highlight the upcoming release of our annual ESG Impact Report in a few weeks. This report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our strategy, initiatives, targets and performance to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our business, consumers, communities, employees and broader stakeholders. In particular, as noted in our last two calls, we have already surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local watersheds and are looking forward to showcasing the initiatives in our beer business that drove most of this achievement and to share more details on our new target in our upcoming ESG impact report. I invite all of you to spend some time reviewing this report when it is released, which will be available through our company website. In closing, I'd like to leave you with four main takeaways from this quarter. First, our beer business continues to outperform the industry and the acceleration of its performance since the beginning of the year has given us confidence to shift our outlook for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial net sales and operating income growth expectations. And just as critical, we remain equally confident about the long-term runway for our higher-end brand portfolio. Number two, the benefits of our Wine and Spirits strategy continue to take hold, we expect the net sales growth and operating income growth of that business to ramp up through the remainder of fiscal '24. And as we look to the coming years, we anticipate our Wine and Spirits business to further gain momentum and achieve stronger results. Number three, we are persistently delivering on our capital allocation priorities, maintaining discipline and balance to yield value and returns, and we remain committed to building on the consistent track record we've established with these priorities over the past few years. And finally, number four, we are excited to be sharing more of these important topics with you at our upcoming Investor Day in four weeks' time. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for Q2 in more detail. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives and our relentless focus on continuing to deliver growth while enhancing our performance. As Bill noted, we achieved yet another strong quarter with double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business while our Wine and Spirits business delivered solid performance across its largest premium, fine wine and craft spirits brands, which partially offset the category headwinds affecting our mainstream brands. We also continue to generate strong cash flow results and execute against our consistent and balanced capital allocation priorities. Now let's review our Q2 fiscal '24 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. To begin, our beer business increased net sales by 12%, representing an uplift of $253 million. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 8.7% as demand for our Beer brands accelerated through the first half of the fiscal year. This growth also benefited from favorable pricing, which contributed $59 million of the overall net sales increase. As a reminder, we continue to expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year from the combination of the wraparound impact from the significant pricing actions taken in Q3 of fiscal '23 and targeted pricing actions we are taking in fiscal 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, beer shipment volume and depletions were generally in line with one another, and I'm pleased to report that our inventories are at healthy levels to support the ongoing growth of our brands. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 7.9%, reflecting a successful summer selling season, driven by ongoing consumer demand across our industry-leading beer portfolio as evidenced by our share gain acceleration; execution of our distribution and marketing strategies, including extending our category leadership across the key summer season and continued positive results from our Shopper-First Shelf initiative; and lastly, the accelerated growth in share gains across our core and emerging markets. Before moving to on-premise performance, I'd like to take a moment to explain a notable recent development in off-premise channel observation. As many of you are aware, Circana tracked channel volume growth has historically been above depletion growth by a low single-digit variance. However, more recently, that variance has expanded to the mid-single-digit range as independent retailers not captured by Circana data have lagged in reversing the additional pricing they took beyond our October fiscal '23 pricing actions. We believe this has led certain consumers to ship from these independent retailers to chain retailers offering more competitive consumer pricing. While the shift in these variances has no impact on the overall demand of our brands we continue to monitor channel performance and plan to provide further updates or insights needed to reconcile tracked channel data with our overall performance as warrant. As a reminder, Circana captures approximately 50% of our total beer volumes. Shifting back to the on-premise channel, depletions were essentially flat year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10.3% of our total beer volume. Please note that while we did have some minor disruptions in our supply of kegs during the second quarter, this Q1 to Q2 step down largely reflects a normal seasonal pattern that we have seen in previous years. Importantly, while there is some disruption in the near-term, we are currently producing and shipping tags and fully expect to offset the impact of the disruptions as swiftly as possible. Looking forward to the second half of the year, as Bill noted, approximately 45% of our volumes will ship in the second half of the year, as a result of it being our lower volume period. In addition, our Q3 shipment volumes are also normally more subdued due to routine maintenance activities. Lastly, from a pricing perspective, we will start to overlap the uplift we saw from significant incremental pricing actions taken in October of fiscal '23. Nonetheless, as we have previously stated, we fully expect our full year shipments and depletions to be largely in line, both on an absolute and a year-over-year growth basis by fiscal year-end. In regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter, please note, for the remainder of fiscal '24, Q3 sales days will be flat year-over-year, and there will be one more selling day in Q4. Now let me review beer margins. For Q2, operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 39.9%. This decrease was driven mostly by the ongoing inflationary pressures in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 17%. The largest drivers of these cost increases came from packaging and raw materials, incremental costs related to a voluntary product recall of select kegs for quality assurance. And higher depreciation that amounted to $12 million or a 24% increase. To mitigate the inflationary and depreciation pressures, we continue to work across the business on cost efficiency and operational productivity programs that yielded meaningful and sustainable benefits. Building on the $30 million of net savings delivered by these initiatives in the first quarter, we realized an approximately $20 million in incremental net savings, in the second quarter. In addition to our cost-saving initiatives, we incurred margin benefits from the following. A $4 million or 2% decrease in marketing expense, primarily driven by the divestiture of our craft beer business. Marketing as a percent of sales came in at 7.1% for the quarter and a $3 million or 3% decrease in SG&A expense, which was primarily the result of favorable foreign currency impacts. Regarding Q2, our marketing spend as a percent of net sales was outside of our previously stated algorithm of 9% to 10%. As usual, part of this relatively lower percentage in Q2 and is a reflection of the strong volume and therefore, net sales performance of the business due to category seasonality. However, the impact of the reduction in marketing due to the previously noted exit from craft beer has further lowered that percentage. For the full year, we now expect to be closer to the lower end of our stated range of 9% to 10% of net sales due to the craft beer divestitures and our continued focus on ensuring our large marketing investments are prioritized to the highest return areas in our portfolio. As a result of the acceleration in the growth of Beer Business since the beginning of the year, we are shifting our expectations for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial ranges, resulting in an 8% to 9% expected increase in net sales growth and a 6% to 7% and expected increase in operating income growth. Now, moving on to our Wine and Spirits Business. In line with the reshaping of our Wine and Spirits Business to a higher-end portfolio of offerings, we continue to benefit from the solid performance of our largest premium wine, fine wine, and craft spirits brands. Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company, and Mi Campo, which as Bill noted, outperformed the corresponding categories in tracked channels and delivered solid depletion growth. While we are pleased with the results with these leading higher-end brands, our overall Wine and Spirits organic net sales were down 11%, driven primarily by the category headwinds we continue to face from the performance of our volumetrically larger mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA. Our plans to renovate Woodbridge and SVEDKA, are underway, and our Wine and Spirits leadership team is looking forward to sharing updates on this progress at our upcoming Investor Day. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by 15% and depletions decreased by approximately 8%. As a reminder, approximately 55% of the Wine and Spirits sales are anticipated to occur in the second half of the year, where we also expect to see consumer-led premiumization mixed shift towards the higher end to continue, supporting what we believe will be a notable acceleration in the growth trajectory of the business for the remainder of the year. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, was down 12% and operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 18.2%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin decline was primarily driven by the volume declines of our mainstream brands and partially offset by lower material costs, primarily from sustainable packaging projects, supply chain savings, and lower marketing spend as we continue to focus on higher return areas of our portfolio. As we look forward, we continue to expect the Wine and Spirits Business to significantly improve its net sales growth trajectory for the remainder of the fiscal year through a combination of increased contributions from our higher-end portfolio, as well as incremental pricing actions. We expect this acceleration in net sales growth, combined with our continued cost reductions and marketing efficiency initiatives to also support our operating income growth targets. As a result, we remain confident in the outlook for wine and spirits for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal '24 remains unchanged. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expense was approximately $67 million, an overall reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program, lower headcount-related costs and lower compensation and benefits post our reclassification transaction. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $111 million, a 17% increase from the prior year, driven by higher weighted average interest rates on the portion of our debt with adjustable rates, which is approximately 5% of our debt obligations and higher average borrowings due to the financing of the share reclassification. However, we now expect interest expense for the full year to be approximately $460 million roughly $40 million lower than our prior guidance due to refinancing actions for some of our higher interest debt and faster-than-expected deleveraging throughout the year. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times excluding Canopy equity earnings and expect to continue to make progress towards our three times ratio target over the coming quarters. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 17.8% versus 20.3% last year. For fiscal '24, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the second quarter year-to-date of fiscal '24, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, a 15% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 34% increase in CapEx investments attributable to the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. As of Q2, we have fully commissioned our latest additional brewing capacity project at our Obregon facility and now have approximately 47 million hectoliters of capacity across our two breweries. Looking ahead, we remain on track to bring our ABA facility online at Nava towards the end of this fiscal year. And the development of our additional expansion at Obregon and our third brewery site at Veracruz are advancing as planned. We continue to expect fiscal '24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Our comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.80 as a result of the continued profitable and disciplined growth we have seen this year, we are raising fiscal '24 reported EPS guidance to between $9.60 and $9.80 and comparable EPS guidance, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be between $12 and $12.20. And finally, our announced dividend of $0.89 a share will result in approximately $163 million returned to shareholders for the quarter. In closing, I'd like to say that our entire team continues to execute and deliver against our strategic priorities. We demonstrated solid execution in the first half of fiscal '24 and as we enter the back half of the year, we plan to remain disciplined as we seek to drive long-term profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value. Our management team is excited to meet with many of you this coming November as we lay out our medium and long-term ambitions and vision for Constellation Brands at our Investor Day. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Vivien Azer : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Bill Newlands : You bet. Vivien Azer : So, obviously, very strong one half results in the year. I've been getting a lot of questions on why the positive revision to guidance wasn't a little bit more robust. And, obviously, Bill, you laid out some of the factors to contemplate from a shipment perspective as well as from the lapping of pricing that Garth called out as well. But is there anything incremental that you can offer in terms of your outlook for the category in the back half that might have informed a little bit more caution as well? Thanks. Bill Newlands : No. We remain very positive about the back half of the year. The critical things that are important relative to our back half is normal seasonality. We only do 45% in the back half, we do our maintenance in Q3, which always limits Q3 somewhat. And we're going against pricing from last year that won't largely be repeated combined with the normal sales buildup ahead of price increases that occurred again in Q3 last year. But let's just keep in mind, when you look at the takeout data you see in tracked channels, our four-week numbers are very consistent with the 52-week numbers. This is an ongoing growth story that we have a lot of confidence in, which is why we raised our expectations for the year in beer. We expect to have a very strong second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to see if you can comment a bit on the shelf resets in the category are large, how you're seeing consumers, I understand the CAG situation and the on-premise consumption. Just hearing, obviously, the shift in market share and you were a beneficiary and you have been doing a lot of work for a long, long time in the shelf resets. And so if you can comment on that, how you're looking at as you go into the spring resets in the large boxes as well as what's happening in the on-premise? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Certainly. We certainly expect to see a strong reset period. You know, there's some limited resets that occur here in the fall. Most of those occur in the spring. Our confidence around that drives primarily from the sheer velocities that we have within our key brands. No, our portfolio is second to none in terms of delivering against velocities. And those have been consistent year-on-year, which gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to see shelf set gains. Retailers are very smart about this, and they recognize where the growth and velocity is coming from and that will work strongly to our advantage as those resets occur. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : Bill, I was hoping you can -- hey, how are you? I was hoping you can just comment on systems and supply chain volume. And I ask this question because a lot of your growth is coming in areas that were not really driving your growth, let's call it, 5 to 10 years ago. So getting the right volume in the right place at the right time requires some adjustment and probably some systems overhaul. So I just -- I was wondering if A, if that is a valid point to be making; and B, if it is, what you're doing internally to make sure that you can actually have the most optimized supply chain? Bill Newlands : Certainly. A couple of things stand out, Nik, around this. As you know, a few years ago, we literally had no redundancy in the system. We now do, and that certainly provides much greater flexibility in terms of our operations footprint to do a number of things. One is to make sure we're able to keep up with our increasing demand that we consistently see on our business and in a scenario where something is accelerating at a greater pace than what we had anticipated. We can react to that. I think, A, that's very strong. Secondly, as you know, we made some significant investments in our digital business efforts and those are really paying dividends in terms of our supply chain capability as well. That has significantly refined our ability to make sure we have the right supply chain capabilities all the way through the supply chain. So, I'd say both of those things have been critically important. In fact, and I know you'll be there -- you'll get a chance to hear about this in some depth during our Investor Meeting on November 2nd. We think this is a critical factor that's been important to our continuing ability to maintain and meet the significant increase in demand that we've seen and we'll go into that in a fair amount of detail on November 2nd. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning, guys. Bill Newlands : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So just two quick clarity questions. The mid-single-digit gap versus Circana data that you saw in this quarter in terms of depletions, do you think that lingers? Might that close back towards the low single-digit gap going forward? Just conceptually, how do you think about that? And in your answer to Andrea's question around shelf space, is there more opportunity this year than a typical year, just given ABI's business is obviously falling off unexpectedly after the spring reset. So, do you think about the shelf space opportunity as greater than typical, just given those dynamics? And there may be greater shifts, even if your business doesn't compete as much directly head-to-head versus them? Bill Newlands : Yes. Sure, Dara. On the first point, the question of whether or not the sort of mid-single-digit continues, I think, remains to be seen. Certainly, as Garth noted at Barclays, and we said during our prepared remarks, it's more than it has usually been so whether or not it refers to the norm of what we usually see, which is sort of lower single-digit remains to be seen, and obviously, one that we watch carefully. Relative to the shelf sets, yes, we think this is going to be a great opportunity for us for all the reasons I answered earlier, which is our velocities are second to none. And we fully expect that we're going to be able to expand our presence. That also impacts some of our new product development. If you think about Oro, I mean, Oro is off to an excellent start much in line with what our expectations were.  And that also gives us a chance to expand our shelf presence because we expect that, that particular brand using that example is going to get more shelf space. The last thing I would say, and I got to call out Chelada\u2019s, because Chelada's has just been absolutely on fire. And our additional sizes and variety pack in those -- in that particular category, again, gives us chance outside of the core beer set to also gain more shelf space. So we need to think about this very broadly because we expect to gain both in what I would call the core beer shelf as well as the ancillary beer shelf as well with things like Chelada. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Gerald Pascarelli : Great. Thanks very much. It's a macro-related question. Bill, one of the questions we get a lot is on student loan repayments. They're going to resume this month after a three-year pause. So just how are you thinking about the impact from that, maybe the potential for down trading, just obviously given some of the premium price points on your beer products? Any color there would be great. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yes. That, again, is one of those things that I think remains to be seen. One of the important things that we see with our brands is the consumer loyalty that is attached to those brands. Taking Modelo as an example, we over-index with the Hispanic community and the Hispanic community has tremendous brand loyalty to Modelo. Also with Corona. Corona is a much broader-based demographic, but that we continue to say it's the most loved beer because it is. I think that's critically important. People make choices all the time about where they're going to spend their discretionary income. And brand strength is critically important about how people make those judgments. So specifically to your question, it remains to be seen, but we feel very confident in our ability to see our brands continue to gain traction simply because there's so much brand loyalty attached to them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Nadine Sarwat : Hi. Two questions for me, please. Coming back to Modelo Oro. Could you share some -- any updated data points that you have, especially, when it comes to cannibalization? And how would you characterize that incremental consumer? And then just one final question on that voluntary ad product recall. Can you quantify the impact that this has had in the quarter, both on top-line and on the margins? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. As I noted earlier, we only had a couple of SKUs in Oro, but it's off to a really good start. And the cannibalization rates were less than we had anticipated and, frankly, less than they were in the three test markets that we had originally run. So we're very positive about that. One place where we're seeing disproportionate pickup on that particular sub-brand of Oro is in the Hispanic community. We've been very pleased by the takeaway in critical, large Hispanic markets, how Oro has done and as we continue to build that out, you'll see additional SKUs coming next year, which we believe will help to continue to accelerate that brand's growth. And if the cannibalization rates stay where they have been, it's going to be better than we had initially anticipated. Garth, do you want to handle the second one? Garth Hankinson : Yes. And just on the CAG recall, the impact was entirely in the cost of goods as related to shipping and destruction of products as well as the initial cost to produce the product. It's -- it wasn't a material movement for us for the quarter. There'll be a little bit more detail in the 10-Q on that, and you can find it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : So I guess a little bit of perspective maybe on -- and this may be a little bit of a follow-up from one of the earlier questions, but just we're getting a lot of questions about demand elasticity, consumer tolerance of inflation. So can you just give us a little bit of perspective for both your beer business and also in wine and spirits, just what kind of economizing behavior might you be seeing? Again, is it like buying more in chain convenience versus independents or choices people are making on packaging. Just as you're kind of looking forward, just kind of where we are on economizing behavior and how you might have to adapt or adjust to that? Bill Newlands : Yes. So I think this points out to where our judicious approach to pricing has been spot on. We've said consistently -- in fact, we got questions about that on prior calls at times about why we weren't taking more price. Our view has consistently been 1% to 2% annually. We were a little more than that the last couple of years, but 1% to 2% is the consistent way that we look at it, and we look at it market-by-market, SKU-by-SKU. The rationale for that is quite simple. It's much easier to keep your consumer than to have to go get them again, if you have lost them. I think in this particular instance, as you point out, people are careful. We're seeing less -- more trips, but somewhat less purchasing per trip than we used to see, which simply means people are being a little more careful about what they do, given the inflationary environment that exists. I think the important part for us is the fact that even though there are more trips, they are making more trips to purchase more of our brands, even if they might spend a little less on any particular trip, again, that speaks to what I just replied to on the prior question, which is about our brand loyalty and about the consistent consumer dynamics that really works to our advantage over the long run. So again, I think the critical element to that is our judicious pricing approach over time is one that's going to do us very well when you're in a consumer environment that people are a little bit more concerned or a little bit more nervous about the inflationary environment. And I think that's going to work to our advantage as we go forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Carey : Hi, everyone. Garth, can you just comment on how inflation is coming in relative to your expectations entering the year, puts and takes. I asked this in the context of your comments around marketing coming in at the low end of the historical range for the full year. And I would just be curious on how you view gross margin delivery in the quarter relative to expectations with any context on the back half of the year? But -- so anyway, high level, just trying to get some context around how costs are running relative to what you were thinking going and maybe you can frame how this delivery is coming in, again, relative to your going expectations? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Look, as a reminder, we expect our beer operating margin for this fiscal year to be around 38%. That remains unchanged. And as it relates specifically to Q2, Q2 is historically traditionally our higher -- our highest margin quarter given the volume associated with Q2. And so in the second half of the year, obviously, we're going to continue to face inflationary pressures that we've had all year long. We are seeing some easing in inflation as expected as we've gone through the year. Unfortunately, while we've seen some improvement in inflation, we've also seen a strengthening peso kind of hold up. And so any improvement that we had due to inflation has been really offset by the strength of the peso. And then again, in the second half of the year, because of the historically lower volume that we have in that half, there will be an impact, obviously, to fixed cost absorption as well as COGS and marketing and additionally, incremental depreciation as we brought on over gone partway through the year. And then as Bill noted in his remarks, it scheduled maintenance that we traditionally do in the second half of the year as well as the overlapping and the pricing benefits last year. So all in, I mean, those are sort of the factors that will contribute to the 38% margin for the full year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren, are you self-muted? Bill Newlands : Hello, Lauren. Operator : Lauren, unfortunately, we can't hear you. Are you muted? I will move on and Lauren\u2026 Bill Newlands : I think come back again. Operator : You got it. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on your productivity programs, the specific buckets that you've addressed that you're targeting? And is this something that is potentially a multiyear process of system optimization? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Thanks, Robert. Yes, I would say that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives certainly are multiyear in nature. Obviously, we communicated earlier this year in Q1, we had taken $30 million out and then this year, an incremental $20 million for this quarter, I should say, an incremental $20 million. We're always looking at ways to sort of prove productivity create efficiencies in the business, whether that's through supply chain and procurement or operations.  Examples of that over time have been things like double stacking rail cars and the use of plastic pallets optimizing the location of inventory, as Bill referenced in response to a question earlier, improved purchasing in terms of raw materials, through better contract management and negotiations, as well as more effective and efficient use of our marketing spend. So it's absolutely something that the organization is focused on a year-on-year basis. And certainly, we will share a lot more detail on our cost savings initiatives for both our beer and our Wine and Spirits businesses at our upcoming Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. Bill, you mentioned that the last four-week trends has been very strong and consistent with the last 52 weeks. Can you give a little bit maybe more color on the performance of your business in September. And then at the industry level, one of your competitors, the Investor Day mentioned that September for the industry is particularly sluggish, particularly last couple of weeks as you cycle the shipments ahead of the price increases in the last year. So maybe some color on the timing of shipments into September into Q3 would be helpful. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. When I look at the most recent Circana data for four weeks, our total beer business is up 13.7%, which is very consistent with what the 52 weeks. That's what I was alluding to in my prior comments around that. Certainly, as we also noted, we expected that we would see some element of tightness during the course of the beginning of this quarter that we are in purely because we are lapping the October price increases that occurred last year and some of the prebuild that people do the retailers do ahead of any price increases that existed. All of that's consistent with what we've expected. And we expect, as we've said, the reason we raised the -- our guidance expectation around beer is because we expect to have a very strong back half of the year despite a couple of these headwinds that certainly exist. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Strelzik : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on capital allocation and in particular, around buybacks. And I think you noted no buybacks during the quarter but being on track for your target to offset dilution year-to-date. I guess, my question though is what's the appetite for buybacks in excess of that, particularly given the momentum in the business, the strong cash flow generation. How are you thinking about that now versus where you were at the beginning part of the year and moving forward? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Yes. So capital allocation is obviously something that we're going to discuss in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Day. But just broadly speaking, I would say, for this fiscal year, as we noted when we entered this year, we were going to at least buy back the dilution that occurred throughout the year. But this year, we are also prioritizing getting our leverage ratio back to our target of 3.0 versus where it was at an elevated state as a result of the reclassification. That said, we're always looking to be flexible and agile as conditions allow for. So something we continually look at. And just as a reminder, we do have $800 million remaining under our current board authorization. So in the event that we decide we want to be a bit more active, we have the ability to do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Hi. Can you hear me? Bill Newlands : We do. Garth Hankinson : We can. Bill Newlands : Part two. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, hooray. Okay, cool. Sorry about that, I don't know what happened, but just quickly, I was going to ask about wine industry growth. And just against the backdrop of your comments on Woodbridge/SVEDKA, obviously not wine, and then the higher end brands performance. But just as you think about the path forward, not just second half, but into next year and so on, how do you think about wine industry growth, wine versus beer versus spirits? I'm guessing we'll get into this a bit more the Investor Day, but I was just curious if you could preview a bit your view on kind of that long-term growth in wine? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Yes, certainly, Lauren. It's really the tale of two cities. The lower end piece of the business, what we refer to as mainstream, has been very challenged. It's down mid to high single-digits, which obviously is somewhat challenging for us because we do have significant involvement with that category still even though we have divested a number of brands that played in that category. So that certainly is a very different answer than what I would say to you about the higher end portion of the business, where brands like Naomi and Kim Crawford and High West and Booker and things of that nature are all significantly outperforming our plans and expectations and gaining share. You're right. We'll talk about that at Investor Day. The other thing I keep in mind, unlike beer, which is about 45% in the second half, it's directly the flip when it comes to wine. That's 55% in the second half. And as we do, and a disproportionate amount of our business comes from ASPIRA and which much more relates to vintage releases those all tend to occur in the second half which again weights our business toward the back half the year versus the first half the year. And the other one I would just point out which I think is important to recognize. We made the choice as we said early this year that we were going to balance our ships and depletes all year long, as opposed to doing it once in the fourth quarter which is what we did last year That creates a bit of a challenge in the early part of our fiscal year, but gives us a significant improvement proposition in the back half of the year, as that won't occur as it did last year, creating a disproportionate shipment number in the fourth quarter last year, which won't be the case and we will be going against a much better proposition this year. So all in I think the wine business certainly has seen some challenges, but much like we see in the higher end of the beer business. The higher end portion of the category is much stronger and certainly our business in that sector is performing very nicely against category norms. And you're right we will go into all of that in much more depth during our investor discussion on November 2. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for any closing comments. Bill Newlands : Thank you, and thank you all again for joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2024. As anticipated, our beer business further accelerated during its seasonally strongest period of the year to deliver excellent results. In our Wine and Spirits portfolio, our higher-end brands continued to outperform and track channels, and we're looking forward to an acceleration in the growth of that business over the second half. All told, we remain confident in our outlook for the full year and have tightened the expectations for growth in our beer business at the higher-end of the initial range, while increasing our overall EPS outlook as we drove interest expense lower due to our proactive debt management. In closing, I would like to encourage you to tune in for our upcoming Investor Day on November 2nd, where we will be sharing our latest perspective on the medium-term outlook for our business. You will find further details on how to access this event through our Investor Relations website at ir.cbrands.com. Thank you again for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing most of you, if not all of you, November 2. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Joseph Suarez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Joseph Suarez : Thank you, Darryl. Good morning all and happy new year. Welcome to Constellation Brands Q3 fiscal '24 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO, and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Joe, and congratulations on your recent promotion. And good morning all. Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our Q3 fiscal '24 call. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday season and were able to enjoy some of our great products with your family and friends. We have several topics to address on today's call. So let's start with the key takeaways for this quarter. First, I am pleased to report that our Beer business again delivered very strong performance that accelerated throughout Q3. We achieved depletion growth of over 8% for our beer portfolio with a particularly outstanding end to the month of November. We led Thanksgiving beer sales in US-tracked channels and continued to see accelerating momentum in the last week of the month, reflecting both ongoing strong consumer demand and restocking after the earlier Thanksgiving holiday this year. And once again, for another entire quarter, we achieved leading share gains in tracked channels with more than 2 point expansion in the US beer category and a nearly 3 point gain in the higher-end. This marks the 55th consecutive quarter of depletion growth for our Beer business and the 10th leading share gains. Secondly, in line with our consistent disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, we executed $215 million of share repurchases in Q3, while maintaining our net leverage ratio excluding Canopy equity and earnings unchanged from last quarter at 3.2 times as well as continuing to deliver cash returns through our dividend and advancing our organic growth investments at our Obregon brewery, a new brewery site in Veracruz to support additional production capacity for our Beer business. And thirdly, as noted at our recent Investor Day, over the past few months, our Wine & Spirits business, much like others across the industry, has seen a broader marketplace deceleration. In light of these and other near-term headwinds, we are further revising our fiscal '24 organic net sales guidance for Wine & Spirits to be down 7% to 9% and the operating income guidance for that business excluding gross profit, less marketing of brands divested last year, to be down 6% to 8%, which I will elaborate on shortly. Of course, we are not pleased with these revisions at both our leadership team and our Wine & Spirits teams remain fully committed to improving the performance of this business and to achieving its medium-term targets. In addition, as announced earlier today, Robert Hanson has elected to step down from his role as President of our Wine & Spirits business in a few weeks at the end of the current fiscal year. We have initiated a process to identify a successor for this role and I will step into lead the Wine & Spirits business in the interim, while of course, retaining my Chief Executive oversight across both the enterprise and our Beer business. Despite these revisions and leadership changes, as noted at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that over the medium term, our Wine & Spirits business should accelerate its net sales growth to 1% to 3% and improve operating margins to 25% to 26%, supported by the significant transformation undertaken over the last few years to better align our portfolio with broader consumer-led premiumization trends, expand our omnichannel capabilities and extend into targeted international markets. More importantly, in fiscal '24, we still expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance excluding Canopy to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as outlined at our Investor Day. Now let's step through these key points for Q3 in more detail. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Modelo Especial led to charge, achieving a roughly 12% increase in depletions and remained the leading share gaining brand in tracked channel dollar sales, strengthening its position as the number one beer brand in the US market having ultimately achieved that top spot now on a 52-week basis. The broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results. Cheladas achieved an increase in depletions of approximately 22% year-over-year in Q3. And on a rolling 12-month basis, the combined set of Chelada flavors and pack sizes reached the 20 million case milestone, which is over 350% more than that set of brands was doing just five years ago in fiscal '19. Additionally, Modelo Chelada Especial, our original flavor, which was recently launched in a 12-pack 12-ounce format was a top 15 share gainer in Circana in Q3, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for our new Chelada flavor and pack size additions. Also in the Modelo family, Oro, continued its strong first year of going national with a third quarter as a top five share gainer in the high-end. We look forward to the growth opportunities ahead for Oro as awareness grows and we introduce new pack sizes next fiscal year. Beyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico core beer brands continued to perform strongly in Q3. Corona Extra maintained depletion growth at about 1%, while Pacifico delivered an outstanding 19% increase. And on a rolling 12-month basis, Pacifico also reached the 20 million case milestone, double its volume from five years ago. In addition, both brands remained top 10 share gainers across the entire US beer market in tracked dollar sales. Our beer brands clearly continued to resonate strongly with the consumer, and I'm incredibly proud of and thankful to our entire beer team for their consistently strong execution. With that backdrop, we remain confident in our fiscal '24 net sales growth guidance of 8% to 9%. And from an operating income guidance perspective, we now expect our beer business to deliver 7% to 8% growth for fiscal '24 as we realize additional benefits this year from the marketing effectiveness actions discussed during our Investor Day. Over the medium term, we still see significant opportunities to continue to achieve net sales growth of 7% to 9% in our Beer business supported by the fundamental distribution, innovation and demographic drivers, as well as consumer-led trends also discussed at our recent Investor Day, as well as to continue to achieve best-in-class operating margins of 39% to 40% supported by savings and efficiency initiatives across our cost of goods sold, marketing, and broader SG&A. And last but not least, we continue to support the growth of our Beer business through modular investments in brewing capacity and productivity initiatives to unlock further production upside. Moving on to the Wine & Spirits business. As noted earlier, our Wine & Spirits business is operating amid a broader marketplace deceleration. As we have shared in recent quarters, we are actively working to address mainstream headwinds affecting our two largest volume brands Woodbridge and SVEDKA. However, we anticipate these efforts to extend beyond fiscal '24. More broadly, while we are maintaining a disciplined approach to taking price across our portfolio, the competitive environment is now getting pressured with more aggressive discounting and price points beyond mainstream. Again, we believe the broader deceleration in these higher-end categories to be temporary and have continued to execute strategic pricing actions instead of implementing reductions like certain competitors. In addition, we have made the decision to adjust some aspects of our US wholesale distributor agreements focused on improving mix, inventory, and state and channel level sales execution. We are actively engaged with our largest distributor partner to ensure that our portfolio continues to make progress against our vision of leading the higher-end as well as on the revitalization of our mainstream brands. From an international perspective, while we experienced a decline in the quarter driven by previously noted weakness in our more mature markets, inventory levels in Canada, our largest export market, seem to now be normalizing following the destocking from recent changes to inventory regulations. So we anticipate more balanced supply-and-demand dynamics for this market going forward. Importantly, despite the impact of these near-term headwinds on organic net sales, our prudent pricing and cost efficiency efforts enabled margin improvement for Wine & Spirits in Q3. Beyond these near-term challenges, our focus remains on driving growth across our higher-end brands. As shared during Investor Day, over the last few years, our Wine & Spirits business has established a stronger foundation to advance toward these targets. Since fiscal '19, we have doubled the number of fine wine and craft spirits brands in our portfolio and we have invested and expanded our footprint in higher-growth DTC channels in targeted international markets. With our structural transformation securely in place, I want to thank Robert Hanson for his contributions over many years including initially as a non-executive member of the Board. We wish Robert well and all the best in his future endeavors and look forward to announcing the appointment of our next Wine & Spirits business President in the near future. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize again our unwavering commitment to our consistent, balanced, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As noted at our Investor Day event, we continued to target a strong balance sheet that supports our investment-grade rating and we are working toward a net leverage ratio of 3 times which we expect to achieve within fiscal '25. We expect to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 30%, supporting continued growth of our dividend per share in line with our earnings expectations. We plan to invest approximately $5 billion in growth and maintenance CapEx from fiscal '24 to fiscal '28, primarily focused on brewing capacity expansions for our beer business. We continue to opportunistically buy back shares with $215 million repurchased in Q3, which leaves us with an additional $2.6 billion still within our existing share repurchase authorization. And finally, we continued to look at tuck-in gap-filling M&A opportunities with a highly rigorous transaction criteria. So to close, let's go back to the key takeaways for the quarter. First, we have a beer portfolio and team that consistently delivers industry-leading performance and we see significant opportunities as outlined at our Investor Day to continue to drive similarly strong growth over the medium term. Second, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders through consistent execution of our balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities and third, our Wine & Spirits business is focused on realizing net sales growth and improved operating margins by leveraging its reshaped higher-end leaning portfolio as well as our enhanced DTC channel and international market footprints and capability. And lastly and importantly, we continue to expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance in fiscal '24 excluding Canopy to remain within our previously-stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium-term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as we outlined at our Investor Day. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in greater detail. Garth? Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion on our financial performance will mainly focus on comparable basis results and stepping through our P&L. However, as of this quarter, we will discuss enterprise results, followed by business segment detail to better address our performance against the outlook shared at our Investor Day at these different levels. Beginning with net sales. We achieved enterprise-wide top line growth of 1% for the quarter. This was the result of solid Beer net sales growth of 4%, partially offset by the Wine & Spirits net sales decline of 8%. Wine & Spirits net sales decline was 7% on an organic basis. As Bill noted, Beer business depletions for the quarter were above 8% as the year-over-year growth momentum from summer continued through the fall, supported by ongoing strong consumer demand of our portfolio. Again, we saw a particular acceleration in depletion volumes at the end of November as we extended our leadership across key holidays with outstanding performance during US Thanksgiving. Our on-premise channel realized modest growth in depletions of about 1% for Q3 and accounted for approximately 11% of our total volumes as we've been able to replenish inventories following the keg disruption over the summer and began to advance growth and drive performance in the on-premise. Shipment volumes for beer business grew 3.4%, and we achieved favorable pricing slightly above 1% as we began to lap the elevated pricing increases from last fall. These volume and pricing uplifts were partially offset by a shift in packaging mix. Altogether, these year-over-year shipment, pricing and mix changes drove the 4% or approximately $77 million increase in beer net sales for the quarter. For our Wine & Spirits business, organic net sales declined 7%, driven by lower shipment volumes due to the previously referenced category headwinds and the change in our process aimed at aligning shipments and depletions. As a reminder, per prior calls this year, we now make quarterly shipment adjustments to align with depletions versus our former practice of only doing one annual adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter. We believe this process change has partially driven less favorable comparisons for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Now shifting to operating margins. For Q3, enterprise-wide operating income increased 7%, and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 32.3%. This was primarily a result of an increase in operating income of 7% for our Beer business, which also drove a 100 basis point increase in Beer business operating margin to 38.5%. Enterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from a 13% reduction in corporate expense. These Beer business and corporate expense tailwinds were partially offset by a 5% decrease in our Wine & Spirits business operating income, which still yielded a 60 basis point increase in operating margin to 25.4% for the Wine & Spirits business. Excluding the gross profit, less marketing, of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, operating income and operating margin for the Wine & Spirits business decreased by 4% and increased by 80 basis points, respectively. Stepping through these drivers in more detail, starting with beer. The increase in operating income and margin were a result of benefits and cost of products sold as we continue to build cost efficiency and productivity savings. For the quarter, total cost savings were approximately $55 million. An $11 million or a 6% decrease in marketing costs as a result of shifts in timing of spend. Note that marketing as a percent of net sales was 8.7% for the quarter. A $4 million decrease in SG&A expense, primarily driven by lower legal fees, partially offset by higher compensation and benefit expenses and $6 million of favorability from the divestiture of our craft beer business. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million unfavorable foreign currency impact as we still realized a higher Mexican peso rate year-over-year, inclusive of our multiyear hedging positions. Additionally, in line with our full year expectations and guidance we are still facing higher costs in our packaging and raw materials, which resulted in a $17 million headwind for the quarter. We have also faced an $11 million increase in depreciation as a result of our capacity expansions. The reduction in our corporate expense, which for the quarter was $10 million, was primarily driven by the reduction in third-party services, particularly in our digital business acceleration investments partially offset by increased compensation and benefits. Our Wine & Spirits operating income margin, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture had a year-over-year improvement as the volume declines and unfavorable mix were more than offset by reduced logistics and warehousing costs, favorable SG&A costs due to reduced third-party consulting expenses and lower compensation and benefits. More favorable material costs driven by our cost savings initiatives and reduced marketing expense as we continue to shift our marketing focus towards more efficient, high return efforts. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $104 million, driven by higher average borrowings and higher weighted average interest rates. As a reminder, approximately 5% of our debt obligations are subject to adjustable rates. As Bill noted, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times excluding Canopy equity and earnings and remain on track to reach our target goal of 3 times within fiscal 2025. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 18% versus 18.8% last year. Our comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.24, reflecting the consistent growth of our business and representing an 8% increase. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and a 10% decrease driven by a 33% increase in CapEx investments attributable to the expansions at our existing Obregon facility and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. As we look towards the end of fiscal '24, our guidance for enterprise comparable EPS, excluding Canopy equity and earnings remains unchanged at $12 to $12.20 underpinned by the following expectations. First, an unchanged 8% to 9% net sales growth outlook but a higher 7% to 8% operating income growth expectation for our Beer business. As stated in our prior calls this year and at our recent Investor Day event for our beer net sales, we continue to expect pricing to be between 1% to 2% and mid to high single-digit volume growth in fiscal '24. And we still anticipate shipment volumes for the second half to account for approximately 45% of the full year total. Bill already addressed the drivers of the uplift in our beer operating income growth guidance but it's also important to note that we still expect beer operating margin to be approximately 38% for the full year. Second, for our Wine & Spirits business, we now expect a decline of 7% to 9% in organic net sales and a decline of 6% to 8% in operating income, excluding the impact of the divested wine brands that are no longer part of our results. Bill also already addressed the drivers for these revisions. Third, from a corporate expense perspective, we now expect that to be approximately $260 million to $270 million for the full year which includes a slightly lower end to the range versus our prior expectation. And similarly, our interest expense expectations are now slightly lower at approximately $450 million. And last but not least, we continue to expect our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy, to be approximately 19% and despite the additional $215 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter, we also continue to anticipate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $184 million. Beyond the P&L, for free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal '24, reflective of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of CapEx. In closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading results in our beer business and remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated EPS targets for this fiscal year despite incremental category headwinds affecting our Wine & Spirits business. As we look further ahead, we remain excited about continuing opportunities to build shareholder value over the medium term, which we hope to achieve by capturing the substantial growth opportunities that exist for our Beer business, executing against our consistent, disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities and delivering enhanced performance in Wine & Spirits, supported by the significant transformation that business has undergone and the actions that we are taking to improve this business. We encourage existing and prospective shareholders who have not yet had an opportunity to review our recent Investor Day presentations to access those through our Investor Relations website, ir.cbrands.com to gain further insights into our medium-term perspective on these topics. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and Happy New Year. Bill Newlands : Same to you. Nik Modi : So, Bill, maybe you can provide some context. Obviously, you provided a few intra-quarter updates, one at the Analyst Day and one at the Morgan Stanley conference. Just regarding both the Beer and the Wine & Spirits business and obviously things came out a little bit differently. So I was hoping you can just kind of give us a perspective on what exactly happened to cause some of the delta. And if some of the clarity or perspective you gave us around the gaps between scanner data and your actual results, how we should think about that because I'm sure that's going to be something we're all going to have to start thinking about over the next couple of weeks? Bill Newlands : Sure. Thanks, Nick. And again, Happy New Year to you. As we said in our prepared remarks, we're obviously very pleased with our Beer business in Q3 and we are particularly happy with the strong acceleration in the momentum that sort of came out of November. Interestingly enough, the delta between Circana and our numbers sort of changed about the minute Garth stopped speaking at the conference in November. So that was always interesting how that works. As we've noted, we expect about 45% of our Beer business volumes will be achieved in H2, which is in line with the normal seasonality of that business. And for Q4 specifically, we expect those shipments in depletes will end up being about 20% to 21% of our total fiscal year volumes. But we also expect that we're going to continue to drive mid to high single-digit volume growth annually, which is consistent with the depletion performance that we've now achieved for over a decade. And again, that's consistent with what we've also said, 1% to 2% annual average pricing increases, which supports the 7% to 9% annual net sales algorithm that we've said we will do in the medium term. On the Wine & Spirits side, obviously, we're further revising our guidance down, was not a decision we took lightly, and we're certainly not happy about it. We examined numerous scenarios and ultimately determined the adjustment was really needed to reflect a number of things. The broader category deceleration and other factors that affected our performance including gaps from our prior US wholesale expectations that we're actively addressing with our distributor partners and importantly, while making sure we maintain an appropriate inventory level for the remainder of this year, setting ourselves in good position to see sequential improvement in fiscal '25. Of course, as I said, we're not pleased with these revisions, and neither is our leadership team nor our Wine & Spirits team, but we're certainly committed to improving that performance in the medium term and expect that our net sales and operating margin targets will be consistent with what we said at Investor Day. As you've also seen, I'm going to be temporarily taking over that business, and I will be spending a fair amount of time with the Wine & Spirits division as we work through the process of appointing a new leader, which we have already started considering both internal and external candidates. As you probably know better than many, I spent several years of my career within the Wine & Spirits categories, and I look forward to working more closely with that team in the interim, particularly as that business turns its focus toward enhancing operational effectiveness and marketplace execution to build on the reconstituted higher-end portfolio and organizational structure that we put in place over the last few years. But ultimately, and I'd like to, Nik, reiterate this one more time. In fiscal '24, we still expect our enterprise EPS guidance to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20 and over the medium term, we also continue to expect low digit EPS growth, as outlined at Investor Day. Hopefully, that gives you some good perspective on those elements you asked about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning and Happy New Year, everyone. I wanted to drill down a bit more on your beer margins. Bill and Garth, you raised your fiscal year beer operating income growth guidance. But this does still imply very low op margins in Q4. So I guess I'd like to better understand the drivers of this. And really how much visibility you have in terms of whether it's your marketing expense or commodities, hedges, et cetera, for the rest of this fiscal year? And then perhaps any color on how margins should be phasing next fiscal year would be helpful. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Bonnie, just to start on the question for next fiscal year, obviously, we'll give guidance on next fiscal year at our next conference call in April. But as it relates to margins this year, I mean, obviously, margins are progressing in line with what our expectations are. And what you saw in the third quarter, this is the first time from a year-over-year perspective where we had margin improvement which again is what we expected at the outset of the year. What we've always said about margins is, and this ties back to what we've said about volumes and shipments and depletions is 55% of our activity will occur in the first half of the year and 45% in the second half of the year. And in Q4, specific to your question on Q4, that -- it's always typically one of our lower shipping quarters. And so therefore, margins are lower just by virtue of reduced throughput through our facilities. On top of that, we continue to have increasing depreciation costs that we referenced during our prepared remarks. But as I say, I mean, we do expect that Q4 margins this year will be better than they were of last year, continuing the trend of year-over-year improvement and which, obviously, we feel confident about our ability to get back into our 39% to 40% range as we went into very good detail at our Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, guys. Good morning. You're depleting -- right now, you had a run rate of about 8%, or I guess you did 8% for the quarter. There's expectations for some pretty good shelf space gain in April. Could you give some context on what that might mean for a tick-up in depletion? Bill Newlands : Well, here's what I'd say about that. As we said earlier, we were very pleased with the 8.2% that we got in the quarter, and we finished November very, very strong. And certainly, we were up, as you would have expected, that strong performance in late November continued into December. So we're very excited about our ability to continue to see exceptional depletions as we move into this calendar year and soon into the new fiscal year. The important thing to me is we continue to gain share. Our two share point gains that you saw in the overall category, nearly three in the high end, continue to be industry leading and are frankly an acceleration of what our share gains had been earlier in the year. So we're very comfortable again, 79% top line driven by mid-plus single-digit growth profile, which we've said we see the runway on that for a long time to come. And certainly this quarter and certainly our expectations for the rest of the year are consistent with that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back, Bill, and just ask a bit about the management transition in Wine & Spirits. And I guess, a, what are you looking for? Like, what are the attributes or the skill set that you think is needed? And then if you could just maybe separate how much of the focus on wine or how much of the improvement path is going to be dependent on uncontrollable? So just the category improving and how much of it is, you think, things that are controllable, things that -- execution elements or things that the Constellation can do to improve? Bill Newlands : Sure, thanks for the question, Brian. I'd say this, our transformation of that business is largely complete. As we've said now a number of times, it's a very different business than what it was several years ago, even though we still have a fair amount of business in the lower end of the business. What I would say is this. We will be focused on an individual who can bring great operating efficiencies and execution in the marketplace. We think it's critically important that we improve our wholesale performance in the United States, and we think there's going to be continuing opportunities for us to perform very well in DTC and international channels as we have developed that business over the last couple of years. All of those things, I would argue, are well within our control. A lot of work is being done on the mainstream portion of the business, particularly on SVEDKA and Woodbridge to enhance the performance of those businesses. I think that you will start to see that play out in the new fiscal year. And we believe that -- we believe some of the softening that's occurred in the overall business is transitory and will come back our way, given the real strength that we've seen in our higher-end business like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and the Prisoner and Mi Campo and things of that nature. So I'm always of the belief that a significant portion of your results are really within your control and we're going to focus on those critical factors that improve our business performance as we head into the new fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Nadine Sarwat : Hi everybody, thank you for taking my questions. A two-parter for me. First, you obviously have posted really good beer depletions this quarter, but looking at 2023 for the overall industry, US beer has been weaker than the historical plus or minus 1% that we've seen over the last decade. I'd love to hear your thoughts in your experience why you think that is. Any key takeaways to share on the health of the consumer? And what would you expect to see for the industry as a whole in \u201824? And then finally, just to come back to Wine & Spirits again, good to hear you reiterating that medium-term growth algorithm you disclosed at the Investor Day. But would it be possible for you to share more details as to how -- where that conviction and achieving that is given the guidance kept today, any building blocks. I appreciate the initiatives you mentioned, but clearly the gap between the guidance for this fiscal year and that medium growth algo is quite big now. So any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. So let's start with the overall beer market. One of the things that we've seen and it's accelerated a bit is the separation between the low end and the high end in the beer market. The high end continues to be where the strength is and we continue to be the leader in the high end, gaining almost 3 share points in the most recent period. Part of that is driven, I think, by a couple of things. One is we have such a strong base with the Hispanic consumer where beer remains a critical part of their consumption pattern. Our brands have great brand loyalty. And again, that's very valuable to us as time goes forward. But one of the things that we also noted, let's take the light beer category. While there's been a lot of movement within that category within brands, the overall sector is not overly healthy. It's down. And we've noted that continuously. So I think the important part as you think about the overall beer sector is to look at it bifurcated. The low end has not been successful and has been challenged on a volumetric basis, but the high end continues to perform well and we're fortunate that we are leading at the high end. As it relates to the Wine & Spirits, what I'd like to do on that particular point, given I'm about to do a major deep dive into that business, is we'll come back to you with more details on where we see our progress going to occur in that particular business when we do our next earnings call at the beginning of the new fiscal year. What I would say is this. We're going to be focused -- very, very focused, on execution and working closely with our distribution partners to make sure that we are outperforming the categories in which we play through our distributor network. That's going to be an important part of our ongoing success going forward, and it will be a critical part of where I'm spending my time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Garth Hankinson : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : Garth, the beer savings number that you called out, which I believe was $55 million, is a big number, certainly in the context of the savings targets through fiscal \u201828 that you laid out at Investor Day. And so I guess, are you pulling forward savings into fiscal \u201824 from other years, or are you perhaps just getting better at the ability to drive savings in the near term and perhaps we should be thinking about over-delivery or maybe just building more confidence in your ability to hit those targets over time? So again, I'm just trying to get some context for your self-help capacity in the beer gross margin, which was quite strong this quarter. Garth Hankinson : Chris, thanks for the question. And I guess the short answer to our question is no, we're not pulling anything forward from future years in FY \u201824. I do think that what you're seeing this year is a continuation of a couple things. One which we detailed at Investor Day, which is the shift from us from being builders of breweries to operators of breweries. And so we're getting more efficient, we're doing a better job from an end-to-end supply chain, and that's what gave us the confidence not just in this year, but in the cost savings targets that we laid out at Investor Day. Another thing that we're seeing benefits from is out of our digital business acceleration activities, which have been coupled with the discipline that we're creating on an end-to-end supply chain and it's driven significant savings in a whole host of areas as it relates to procurement. So again, it is somewhat new muscle that we're building, really more an extension of existing muscle as we, again, migrate from being builders to operators. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Just two follow-ups probably on Nik's question. Just first on beer, just to understand the strength and depletions at the end of the quarter. Is that more underlying strength? Was there anything timing related there? Is it continued in December? Should we look at sort of the 8% result in the quarter as sort of a true underlying gauge of the business, at least short-term, understanding that's not the guidance, but how should we think about that? And I know it's tough to talk about the gap versus scanner data. Obviously, it bounces around. But just any specific thoughts on what that could be going forward? And then I also have a wine question, if I can follow up on that. Bill Newlands : Dara, why don't you do that right away? Because usually once you ask a question, you don't have further access. What's your wine question? Dara Mohsenian : Okay. I mean, just look, the comments on the revision were helpful in the longer-term portfolio transformation, but at the risk of being blunt, it's been sort of years of disappointment on that business. It's a pretty large negative revision after Analyst Day in a short period of time. So I just wanted to hear a little more about the response, Bill, and how you might manage that business differently from a strategic lens longer term, perhaps a greater focus on productivity or whatever the changes are. But how do you think about managing the business differently and maybe how it fits in the portfolio just juxtaposition versus what's a very attractive beer business as we saw again this morning from a growth and margin standpoint. Bill Newlands : Sure. So let's cover the first one initially about the depletions coming out of the quarter. Obviously, there's always a little bit of benefit when you have an early Thanksgiving because you give retailers a chance to restock after Thanksgiving. But let's make no mistake, the takeout that we had around the Thanksgiving holiday was exceptional, which you wouldn't get the great restocking if you didn't have an exceptional takeout period. And obviously we're very pleased to see, without going into specifics, that the strong November is playing into December as we expected it would because the underlying trends for our business remain very strong. And as I stated at an earlier question, our actual share gains have accelerated during the course of the year, which I think is very positive as well relative to our continuing success in that business. As it relates to wine, as I said before, the thing that we were most concerned about coming out of this particular quarter is that we end our year in an appropriate inventory position and that we are preparing ourselves to work closely with our wholesale distributor partners to accelerate that business going forward so that we are winning in the categories and channels in which we participate. We've got a lot of work to do there, but we continue to believe the strategy work that's been done over the past few years to reposition our portfolio much more to the higher end is going to pay dividends. And again, as I said, I think, to Nadine a moment ago, I'll come back with some more specific thinking. We're going to do, as you can understand, a fairly deep dive into that business. And I'll have some more thoughts on that as we get to our next call. Garth Hankinson : And, Dara, as it relates to the gaps in Circana versus depletions, and as you mentioned in your question, it can be a bit difficult to draw parallels between the two. Look, for the balance of the year going forward -- for at least the balance of the year going forward, and we'll give updates on this as we see fit, but I think you still have to think about that gap being in the mid-single-digits. That being said, I'll kind of remind everybody of the comments we made at [your] (ph) conference last month, which is, we think that looking at this, that syndicated consumer takeaway data is really best to gauge long-term trends as well as relative performance. Just as a reminder, for our own business, Circana only picks up 50% of our total volumes, and there are certainly gaps between the volume growth of different tracked channel data providers. And importantly, you don't see things picked up per se as it relates to differences in time periods, meaning there can be shifts between key weekends or holidays between period to period that make it hard to tie depletions with the Circana data. So again, this is not -- we don't use the syndicated consumer takeaway data the way that you do, and that's why we say it's not necessarily the best way to gauge our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. So, with your comments just now on the cadence of the quarter and into the fourth quarter, I wonder why you haven't raised guidance for [the end of fourth quarter] (ph) in terms of top line? And the second part of your question, looking ahead into the strength, how much do you expect that the sharp resets on the back of the strength will come, will structure for that type of 7% to 9% algorithm? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Well, let's start with the second question first. We were quite pleased with the more limited changes that occurred on the shelf set in the back half of last calendar year. But we're expecting significant gains greater than our growth profile here as we get to the spring resets. You would notice that we fully expect that we're going to finish our year in a very strong performance. You will note that we raised the bottom of our guidance, as Garth noted, and I think I noted in my remarks as well. So we actually have raised our expectations around the income side. And of course that translates through into better cash and various other things as Garth noted. So I think you should take away what I hopefully we were trying to portray, which is our business continues to deliver exactly what we've told you what we would deliver on the beer side, 7% to 9% top line growth and strong bottom operating growth to match. And certainly I think our depletion rate coming out of Q3 reflects that strength. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, so wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing. I know that you're talking about 1% to 2%. It was 1% here. So kind of two parts to this. One, what is the kind of the general environment for pricing in the beer industry now, the sense that you get? And second, I know that you do kind of a sporadic pricing, so it's -- a lot of the country is zero and then certain parts is maybe 4% or 5% percent and so then it averages out 1% to 2%. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the timing of your price increases? My understanding that your major competitors are pricing at the end of January and the beginning of February. So how does your pricing fit into that? So that's question number one. And then question number two is kind of hearing a little bit, reading about an innovation, Corona Sunbrew, I think Sunbrew's Citrus that's off to a good start. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on competitor pricing, but what I would say, Robert, is we said early on, and in fact, some of you probably questioned Garth and I on occasion about it, that we believe that 1% to 2% was the right approach. We've done that historically over the long run. We were a little bit higher than that during the really high inflationary timeframe around COVID which we fully acknowledged and recognized. But I go back to what we've always said, which is, we really want to keep our consumer. It's a whole lot more expensive if you chase them off and have to go reacquire a consumer than it is to never lose them in the first place. And the 1% to 2% algorithm has proven very solid for us over the long term and it's one that we're going to continue. I think certainly you see in other categories, people being careful about pricing. And I think that reflects just an understanding of where the consumer may or may not be in various categories. As it relates to innovation, Sunbrew is coming. We plan to talk mainly about that at our introduction for that, which will occur at the beginning of March. So I'm not going to spill all the beans on it, but we're particularly excited about that. We think it's going to be, again, another very interesting new product launch for our company on the heels of very successful Oro launch and very successful Aguas Frescas launch that has occurred in Modelo, which, as you know, is also expanding here in the coming years. So please stay tuned on that one. But I think we're very optimistic that that provides some great opportunity in the Corona franchise. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I know we've covered a lot of ground, but I was hoping you could just touch on the improved cash flow outlook for the year. It was a pretty material change and exciting. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the key drivers on that uptick in outlook. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, thanks, Lauren. So there\u2019s obviously a few drivers of the change in cash flow. And obviously I think that seeing the increase in cash flow just goes to further evidence the very disciplined approach we take to managing the cash of the company. Obviously, some of the drivers there will include things like the increase in beer margin, or I should say beer operating income that Bill referenced in his remarks. There, obviously will be some favorability in the taxes that I referenced in my remarks as well as some other favorability on things like tax rates there -- taxes and things of that nature. But those are the primary drivers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning guys and Happy New Year. I want to go back to the on-premise channel for the Beer business. I think Garth mentioned we grew about 1% in the quarter. I was wondering if there's any more to recover from the keg issue that you guys had. And then if you think about next fiscal year, we talked a lot about the opportunity to gain share in off-premise, but can you comment on your ability to gain tap handles and gain more distribution in the on-premise channel as well? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Yeah, you bet. As we said, we had some temporary impact around kegs, which was largely in Q2 of this year. But I think it is important to point out that last year, both Modelo Especial and Pacifico were the number one and number two share gainers in draft despite some of those temporary issues. Remains a great opportunity for us when you think about it. I mean, let's use an example. Modelo Especial is number five on draft, but is the number one beer by dollars in this country. But it's certainly -- it\u2019s not number one in the on-premise at this point. Again, a great opportunity. So interestingly, Corona Extra is the number one packaged beer on premise but again still having opportunity in the draft side. So we continue to think the draft is going to be an opportunity for us as one of the growth drivers for us going forward. And, Pacifico is a great example, even though it was the number two gainer, when you see just the real acceleration you have in that brand, I think there remains opportunities for both Modelo Especial and Pacifico in particular in the on-premise. And I certainly would hope to see both of those brands maintaining their number one share gainer status as we get into this calendar year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question. Gerald Pascarelli : Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just had a question on your measured versus non-measured channels within beer. So if we look at Nielsen, your price mix is moderated at retail. It looks to be currently running right in line with the midpoint of your 1% to 2% target. So if we compare this to non-measured channels, just curious if you've seen any near-term moderation in pricing. And if not, would you maybe expect trends to become a little more aligned as we look out over the near term? Thank you. Bill Newlands : I think by and large the answer to your question is yes, that those are usually reflective. We don't see a lot of variation amongst channels on that particular thing. Although, you do have some very big markets that are not generally covered by some of those tracked channels, New York being an interesting one. So you do see some variation from time to time, but we don't expect that to be significant moving forward about what the tracked versus what the non-tracked channels look like. Garth Hankinson : And the moderation that you referenced is really just attributable to the lapping of the incremental pricing that we took control of last year. Bill Newlands : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So, Garth, I may have missed this, but is the expectation still for beer depletions and shipments to be roughly equal for the year? And then I think it was mentioned that shipments in the fourth quarter would be around 20% to 21% of full year shipments. Is that quarterly mix similar for depletions as well? Just, we've seen a lot of changes in quarterly mix over the past few years that have resulted in differences in growth rates between depletions and shipments. So just trying to understand how we should think about it specifically for the fourth quarter. Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so shipments and depletions, yes, those should be largely in line with one another for a full year. That's consistent with how we operate the business every year. And from a Q4 timing as it relates to shipments and depletions, yes, both of those are in that 20% to 21% range that Bill referenced earlier. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine's about the competitive and promotional environment in beer. You've talked about your expectations on shelf space gains in the spring, the wider spread between light and premium beer and even some of the pricing dynamics in wine. So just curious, then what you're seeing across the competitive set now, how you're expecting that to evolve as the year progresses next year and maybe any plans or programs or levers should the environment intensify? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Certainly. We expect the promotional environment to be fairly consistent with what it usually is. We don't think there's going to be any radical changes around that topic. I think a lot of it goes back to what we've often said, which is the velocities that we have on our brands are superb. And obviously at the end of the day, the retail environment is very interested in having brands focused on those that deliver outstanding velocities and sales per point of distribution. We shared at our Investor Day that our sales per point of distribution is radically better than the competition, And I think that's going to continue to serve us well, especially when you consider the strong brand loyalty that we have with consumers. As we've also said on numerous occasions, our judicious 1% to 2% pricing actions, we don't pull back on our pricing in the marketplace, which I think is important also. So when we make those commitments to 1% to 2%, that's what we deliver. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with Roth. Please proceed with your question. Bill Kirk : Hey, just one for me, maybe for Garth. I heard the comment about $17 million higher in packaging and material costs for beer. I think that's the lowest year-over-year increase in some time. So is that the low level of inflation you'd be expecting there going forward or is deflation on those items even possible in calendar 2024? And I guess separately it'll probably be in the 10-Q later, but was the transportation cost line for beer, was that deflationary year-over-year in the period? Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so as we said all year long, we would start to see benefits from easing inflation as we move through the year. And obviously we saw that in Q3. Going forward, you asked the question around whether this is at a low point or inflationary in nature. What I would say on that is we laid out a pretty good detail at our Investor Day around what the drivers are that we're expecting over the medium term that are going to result in us getting back in our 39% to 40% percent operating margins. And that includes low single-digit inflation net of our cost savings initiatives. And obviously there's some other offsets that can sound like depreciation, but those really are the drivers moving forward. And then logistics was a bit favorable in Q3 as well. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bill Chappell : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Hey, just one follow-up on the acceleration of the beer in November and into December. I think I'm right in saying a year ago you had started to see a slowdown due to weather in California and the price increases had just taken, there was some elasticity. So was there more than I guess more favorable comps that you saw that drove the acceleration or is that a key part of it or were the comps maybe not as affected by weather and price increases last year as we had assumed? Bill Newlands : Well, as you often know, lots of things go into why you see acceleration. I think you've pointed out some. I think weather in California was better than it was in prior year. You saw Thanksgiving being slightly earlier than it was in prior year. I think all those things are true. What I would emphasize, though, is that the takeout around our business, around Thanksgiving, was particularly strong. And our share gains that occurred during that period were as good as we saw during the entire year, which again, just speaks to the strength of the brand. There's gives and takes all the way along in the year, as you know, from various factors that occur. But when you see that kind of share acceleration that we've been seeing in the sort of the 2 point range in the overall category and 3 point range in the high end, that just speaks to the continuing strength of our Beer business, irrespective of the potential gives and takes that occur naturally over the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining today's call. Again, we're very pleased that our Beer business delivered strong performance in Q3 and is on track to achieve the higher end of our initial net sales and operating income guidance for the fiscal year. Our beer portfolio continues to deliver industry-leading performance, and we see a long runway of opportunities to continue to drive strong growth. In our Wine & Spirits business, we're fully committed to realizing net sales growth and improving our operating margins in line with our medium-term outlook for that business as we leverage its reshaped, higher-end leaning portfolio and enhanced DTC and international footprint. And from a capital allocation perspective, we continue to consistently execute against our balanced and disciplined priorities, which are maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, consistently returning cash to our shareholders through our dividend, and executing opportunistic share repurchases beyond those needed to cover dilutions, while advancing our organic investments to support additional production capacity for our Beer business and deploying excess cash to smaller acquisitions that fill portfolio gaps, but with a thoughtful and prudent approach. Altogether, we remain confident in our outlook for the full year and continue to expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance for fiscal \u201924, excluding Canopy, to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as we outlined in our Investor Day. So, thanks again, everyone, for joining the call, and I wish you all a safe, happy, and prosperous new year. Thank you again for joining. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Snehal Shah, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Shah, you may now begin. Snehal Shah : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Year End Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO, and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in today's news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please note, when we discuss comparable earnings per share figures for fiscal 2024 and prior fiscal years, we are referring to earnings per share on a comparable basis excluding Canopy equity and earnings, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our Company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time today. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thanks, Snehal, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal '24 year-end earnings call. As usual, I'd like to start with a few headlines from this past fiscal year. First, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of strong performance in fiscal '24. We drove comparable earnings per share growth of nearly 9% and remain focused on achieving our stated medium-term target of low-double-digit comparable EPS growth moving forward. This growth was supported by a net sales increase of 5% at an enterprise level and solid operating leverage that resulted in an increase of 7% in comparable operating income, representing an enterprise comparable operating margin of nearly 33%. This performance once again yielded recognition for Constellation Brands as the number one growth leader among large CPG companies by Circana in calendar year '23, as we have been five of the last seven years. We are the only CPG company of scale to make their top 10 ranking for 11 consecutive years. Our continued strong performance and momentum heading into fiscal '25 reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver against the following targets outlined at our Investor Day this past November, maintaining 6% to 8% enterprise net sales growth, delivering 33% to 35% enterprise comparable operating income margin and generating low-double-digit comparable earnings per share growth, all of which we intend to achieve in fiscal '25. Second, from a segment perspective, our fiscal '24 results were largely driven by our Beer Business, which delivered net sales and operating income growth above 9% and 8%, respectively, both exceeding our expectations from the beginning of the year. This strong performance drove our largest dollar share gain ever for a full fiscal year, adding an impressive two points of dollar share within the US beer category. And we achieved a significant milestone this year, as Modelo Especial became the number one beer in US dollar sales. Furthermore, across all beverage alcohol, our Beer Business was the number one dollar share gainer, capturing 1.1 points of share and driving nearly 70% of the total dollar growth in the sector. This was truly a remarkable achievement by our entire beer team working in concert with our distributor and retail partners as they delivered volume growth for the 14th consecutive year, which is certainly another incredible differentiator amongst CPG companies. In our Wine & Spirits business, we faced a series of near-term category headwinds throughout fiscal '24, but remain confident that our strategy is sound. We recently promoted Sam Glaetzer to serve as our new President of Wine & Spirits. He is a well-rounded and accomplished industry veteran with nearly 30 years of experience in the wine and spirits category and a successful track record of driving commercial and operational efficiency and effectiveness. Sam also played an integral role in the implementation of the business transformation over the last few years, leading our global end-to-end supply chain optimization initiatives and building a world-class farming, winemaking, and distilling network aligned to consumer preferences while developing a focused international route to market to deliver incremental growth for the business in the medium-term. Now that the strategic transformation of our Wine & Spirits portfolio is largely complete, Sam is well-positioned to lead our team in driving enhanced focus on execution and the delivery of growth and improved profitability. To that end, our Wine & Spirits team has identified several immediate actions to help drive improvement in our year-over-year top line performance, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Third, we continued to achieve superior cash flow generation and deployed that cash in a disciplined and balanced manner underpinned by our consistent capital allocation priorities. For fiscal '24, we generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and we're able to reduce our net leverage ratio by nearly half a point while returning over $900 million back to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We also continued to prudently invest to support the ongoing growth with total capital expenditures of nearly $1.3 billion in fiscal '24, most of which was focused on capacity additions to our beer brewing operations. And fourth, we continued to deliver against our environmental, social, and governance objectives, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to a more detailed discussion of our fiscal '24 performance, starting with our Beer Business, which despite some challenging weather in our fourth quarter, grew depletions by 9%, resulting in our 56th consecutive quarter of depletion's growth. For the full year, we continue to extend our lead as the number one high-end beer supplier in the US, delivering top share gains across the total beer category, underpinned by a nearly 14% increase in dollar sales and nearly 11% volume growth across tracked channels. And in line with our expectations, we captured low-double-digit percent incremental shelf space this spring while adding another 21,000 resets through our Shopper-First Shelf program in fiscal '24. These factors all played a significant role in driving the growth of our Beer Business paired with the strength of our portfolio's iconic brands, starting with Modelo Especial, which grew depletions by nearly 10% and maintained its leading position as the top share gainer, and as noted earlier, the number one overall beer brand in US tracked channels. Corona Extra increased depletions nearly 1% and maintained its position as the number three high-end beer brand in the US. And Pacifico delivered depletion growth over 17% as it reached the 20 million case sold milestone and remained a top 10 dollar share gainer across the total beer category and the number four dollar share gainer in the high-end. While we continue to build on the success of our iconic brands, we are also building good traction with our focused innovations aligned with consumer-led trends of premiumization, flavor and betterment. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of 30% in depletions, also surpassing 20 million cases sold, and remain the number one Chelada in the category, supported by the launch of our new flavor, Sandia Picante, and new pack-size offerings. We are excited to continue to build on that momentum in fiscal '25 with two new flavors, Fresa Picante and Negra con Chile. Modelo Oro's national launch established a strong foundation for the brand as it rose to become a top five share gainer across the total beer category and the number three share gainer in the high-end with just two SKUs. Given that strong reception and ongoing consumer demand for betterment products, we are launching two more Modelo Oro SKUs in fiscal '25, an 18-pack and a 24-pack. Staying within the Modelo brand family, our new Aguas Frescas variety pack secured the number one new FMB spot in its test market of Nevada. So on fiscal '25, we will be expanding its rollout to another 20 markets for this authentic liquid aligned with consumer-led flavor trends and featuring our nitro technology. In our Corona brand family, we introduced Corona Non-Alcoholic, which is the leading dollar share gainer in the fast-growing non-alcoholic beer segment. As for fiscal '25, we are testing Corona Sunbrew in select Eastern markets. This new, refreshing beer is brewed with real citrus peels and a splash of real citrus juice. The strong execution of our Beer Business in fiscal '24 was also reflected in our ability to maintain best-in-class margins by combating trailing inflation headwinds with cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We also continue to invest in our Beer Business in fiscal '24, deploying approximately $950 million in capital expenditures, supporting our ability to meet the continued robust demand we see for our brands through the expansion of our beer brewing capacity at Nava and Obregon, and the ongoing work at our new Veracruz site. Looking ahead to fiscal '25 and in line with the plan we laid out in our Investor Day in November, we expect our Beer Business to remain within our net sales growth algorithm of 7% to 9% and for operating margins to gradually improve, supported by our operating income growth of 10% to 12%. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Due largely to the challenging market dynamics referenced earlier, our Wine & Spirits business saw declines of approximately 8% for both organic net sales and operating income, but still landed within our revised guidance range. While we do not expect ongoing challenges in the Wine & Spirits category to immediately subside, particularly in the mainstream and premium price segments. We have identified several areas to improve the performance of our Wine & Spirits business in fiscal '25, including, but not limited to, refocusing our efforts within our premium and above brands to more consistently drive growth in our most scaled and central offerings, notably Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner, High West, and Mi CAMPO, while accelerating additional tactical investments to revitalize the equity and support demand for our largest mainstream brand, Woodridge, and ensuring that we continue to support the transformation of other significant brands in our portfolio such as SVEDKA then by Robert Mondavi, Ruffino, and Lumina. Note that these 11 brands represent three-quarters of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our Wine & Spirits business in fiscal '24, which is why we plan to provide more focus and investment for them. Another key area we are focused on is aligning with our US wholesale distributor partners on clear priorities to help enhance our performance in our largest markets and channels. As noted in our prior call, these priorities include enhanced focus on improving mix, inventory, and sales execution. We will also be making additional investments in media spend and price promotions, as well as adjustments in our own sales capabilities to better support the execution and go-to-market efforts of our distributor partners. And similar to our Beer Business, we will continue to focus more broadly on efficiency opportunities to drive operational and sales excellence across our Wine & Spirits segment. This will include the operational and supply chain initiatives highlighted at our Investor Day, as well as enhancements to the business' organizational structure to enable a more effective and competitive operating model. Looking forward to fiscal '25, we expect our Wine & Spirits business net sales to be relatively stable and operating income to be down 9% to 11%. While we believe the focus on sales execution I just outlined will help stabilize the top line growth for Wine & Spirits, our operating income guidance reflects incremental investments in additional media spend, price promotions, and sales capabilities, as well as continued inflationary pressures on some cost of goods sold and lapping of distributor contractual payments and reduced incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal '24. As we noted, we remain committed to continuing to advance this business over the coming years toward the medium-term targets shared at our Investor Day. Moving on to capital allocation, we continue to deliver against our stated priorities and targets in fiscal '24. As noted earlier, we further strengthened our balance sheet with a reduction in our net leverage ratio supported by our strong earnings performance and our disciplined debt management. We returned cash to shareholders and deployed most of our capital investments to brewery expansions to support the growth of our Beer Business. And we continued to conduct tuck-in gap-filling acquisitions that are aligned with consumer-led trends and complemented our portfolio. We also made notable progress in regards to our environmental, social, and governance ambitions in fiscal '24. From a governance perspective, our Board undertook refreshment actions that resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors, each with strong financial backgrounds. We also recently announced the election of a new independent Board Chair, Chris Baldwin, who brings a wealth of senior leadership experience from the CPG sector. In addition, in line with our commitment to be good stewards of the environment, since we had surpassed our initial water restoration target in fiscal '23, we established a new goal of restoring more than 5 billion gallons of water to key watersheds near our operations between the timeframe covering fiscal '23 and '25. This goal is designed to ensure local residents and businesses have ample supply and access to water, which is the key to building sustainable and thriving communities. Finally, we announced two new environmental commitments in fiscal '24 to reduce waste within our key operating facilities and to enhance circular packaging. So in summary, we, once again, achieved another strong year of performance and significant progress across our strategic initiatives in fiscal '24, and we fully expect to build on this momentum in fiscal '25. We are confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value and deliver on our commitments, including achieving low-double-digit comparable EPS growth by generating high-single-digit net sales growth and delivering best-in-class margins for our Beer Business, managing category challenges and improving the growth trajectory of our Wine & Spirits business with enhanced execution, and maintaining our capital allocation discipline and commitment to operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world. As I wrap up, I want to once again thank all of our colleagues across Constellation, as well as our trade partners, for their hard work and dedication in helping us deliver another year of industry-leading performance. And I believe we are well-positioned to keep that momentum going in fiscal '25. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth, who will give more details on our financial results and outlook. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion will focus mainly on our comparable P&L results, starting at an enterprise level followed by business segment detail for fiscal '24. I will then discuss our fiscal '25 outlook and expectations in the same manner. Starting with net sales. As an enterprise, we delivered growth of over 5%, slightly exceeding our fiscal '24 guidance range of 4% to 5%. This was driven by the strong performance of our Beer Business, which grew net sales over 9%, exceeding our guidance of 8% to 9%. As Bill mentioned, our Beer Business had another strong year of depletion growth, a 7.5% increase as the strength of our portfolio carried throughout the entire year. Off-premise depletions grew by over 8%, which represent nearly 89% of our total depletion volume. The on-premise accounts for the balance of our depletions and grew by over 1%. We expect to build on our momentum in off-premise channels supported by the low-double-digit incremental shelf space that we captured this spring, which we foreshadow at our Investor Day last November. And we continue to see opportunity to drive growth in the on-premise with new draft handles, particularly for Modelo Especial and Pacifico in the coming fiscal year. I will elaborate on fiscal '25 shortly. Shipment volumes for our Beer Business in fiscal '24 grew 7.4% and we achieved favorable pricing of 2%. These volume and pricing increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our craft beer business and an unfavorable shift in product mix. In aggregate, the volume, price and mix changes amounted to a nearly $700 million increase in beer net sales for fiscal '24. In regards to selling days, we had one extra sell day in the year, which occurred in Q4. This had a minimal impact on our volumes as shipments and depletions, on an absolute basis, were over 99% aligned for the year. For our Wine & Spirits business, net sales declined 9% and 8% on a reported and organic basis, respectively. The change in organic net sales for our Wine & Spirits business was within our lowered guidance range of a 7% to 9% decline. This decline was largely driven by unfavorable US wholesale performance, particularly across our mainstream and premium brands. As Bill noted, we are working with our US wholesale distributor partners to enhance performance in our largest markets and channels in fiscal '25. Additionally, in our international markets, net sales for fiscal '24 were down 7% by destocking, particularly in Canada, our largest export market. More recently, in Q4, net sales from our international markets grew 14%, largely driven by the Canadian market, where inventory levels have begun to normalize. The net sales declines in our US wholesale and international markets were partially offset by 10% net sales growth in our direct-to-consumer channel. Moving on to our operating income and margin. At an enterprise-wide level, we delivered a 7% increase in comparable operating income at the upper end of our 6% to 7% guidance, resulting in a 50-basis-point increase in comparable operating margin to 32.6%. This was driven by the strong performance of our Beer Business, which grew operating income by just over 8% and delivered an operating margin of 37.9%. Enterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from an 11% reduction or $30 million decrease in corporate expense driven mainly by reduced third-party consulting fees related to our DBA project spend. This solid performance was partially offset by our Wine & Spirits results as operating income excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture declined by 8%. This decline was within our lowered guidance range of a 6% to 8% decline, resulting in a flat year-over-year operating margin of 22.2%. Elaborating on the margin puts and takes in more detail, starting with the Beer Business. The increase in operating income and slight 40 basis point decrease in operating margin were reflective of an absolute increase of approximately 12% in overall cost. This increase in COGS includes the impact of increased volume and the nearly $205 million from cost savings initiatives realized in fiscal '24. By COGS component and on an absolute basis, inclusive of both volume growth and cost savings, year-over-year changes were as follows. Raw materials and packaging represented the midpoint of 55% to 60% of total COGS and had an absolute increase of 16%. Logistics making up just over 20% of total COGS increased 3% as a large portion of the benefits from our cost savings agenda came from this area. Labor and overhead landed at just under 15% of total COGS and increased 19% attributable to the construction activities at our Veracruz Brewery. And the remaining portion of total COGS depreciation increased approximately $37 million, representing the incremental capacity that was brought online in fiscal '24. Moving on to marketing. Our dollar spend increased by approximately 2% year-over-year. As a percent of fiscal '24 net sales, marketing was approximately 8.5%, coming in slightly below our medium-term 9% algorithm, partly driven by the divestiture of our craft beer brands and efficiencies from the transition to our new media agency. Lastly, SG&A, which represented approximately 5% of net sales, increased approximately 8%, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and increased compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by benefits from the craft beer divestiture and lower legal fees. Moving on. Our Wine & Spirits business operating income margin, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture, remained flat year-over-year as the volume decline and unfavorable channel mix were offset by favorability in our COGS driven by nearly $40 million coming from our cost savings initiatives, favorable pricing, reduced other SG&A expenses, and a reduction in marketing expense. Interest expense for fiscal '24 was about $435 million, a 9% increase from prior year driven by higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates. We ended fiscal '24 with a comparable net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, of 3.2 times, leaving us well-positioned to achieve our target of approximately three times in fiscal '25. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings was 18.5% versus 19.2% last year. Comparable EPS for fiscal '24, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $12.38 and came in above our guidance range of $12 to $12.20. Moving to fiscal '24 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow slightly over $1.5 billion, exceeding our $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion guidance range. Free cash flow decreased 12% year-over-year, driven by a 23% increase in CapEx investments attributable to our expansions at our existing facilities and the ongoing construction of our new brewery in Veracruz. In fiscal '24, we increased our total nominal capacity from our Mexico brewery operations from 42 million hectoliters to approximately 48 million hectoliters as a result of the modular expansions brought online over the summer that were fully ramped by year end, along with unlocked incremental capacity through our optimization initiatives. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we, once again, delivered cash returns to our shareholders with over $900 million of expenditures in dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we executed portfolio gap-filling transactions encompassing both a tuck-in acquisition of a female- and Black-founded luxury wine brand with a successful track record and a venture investment in the high-growth non-alcoholic space in fiscal '24. With that, let me now step through our outlook for fiscal '25, starting with net sales. We are targeting our enterprise-wide net sales to grow up 6% to 7%, inclusive of a 7% to 9% growth target for our Beer Business, and a 0.5% decline to 0.5% growth in net sales for our Wine & Spirits business. The beer top line outlook is expected to be primarily achieved by continued strong volume growth of our portfolio. Again, we expect this to come from distribution of our largest brands bolstered by spring shelf reset gains, the health and continued support of our consumers, and innovation in the form of brand extensions, new to world products, and new pack sizes. Regarding beer volumes, we anticipate fiscal '25 shipments and depletions to track closely on an absolute basis, consistent with prior years. Similarly, we expect the cadence of our shipments and depletions, in terms of share of annual volumes from a quarter and a half year perspective to be fairly in line with fiscal '24. For Wine & Spirits net sales, we expect to largely offset ongoing category headwinds as we drive the sales and marketing execution initiatives described by Bill earlier. Additionally, we expect mix-related benefits due to the better performance in our higher-end brands. That said, we continue to anticipate overall volume growth to remain challenged, particularly due to demand headwinds in the mainstream and premium price segments, which account for a major part of our volumes. Furthermore, from a net sales perspective, we're expecting unfavorable lapping of bulk sales in fiscal '24. From a cadence perspective, we also expect quarterly and half yearly shipments and depletion shares of the full year total to be fairly aligned with fiscal '24. For fiscal '25 operating income, we expect comparable enterprise-wide growth between 8% and 10%, reflecting 10% to 12% operating income growth for our Beer Business, a 9% to 11% operating income decline for our Wine & Spirits business, and a slight increase in corporate expense to approximately $260 million. For our Beer Business, we anticipate operating income tailwinds from volume growth and favorable pricing. We expect these tailwinds will be partially offset by continued input cost inflation with an absolute increase in COGS, inclusive of volume growth, cost savings initiatives, and our multi-year hedging actions in the high-single-digits. We expect the following percent of total COGS and absolute increases across each component, for packaging and raw materials to account for 55% to 60% and increase mid to high-single-digits. Logistics to make up approximately 20% and increase mid-single-digits. Labor and overhead to be approximately 15% and increase in the high teens, primarily driven by merit salary increases, given the strong operational performance from the business and incremental headcount, primarily at our Veracruz Brewery, as we continue with construction. And the remainder of COGS depreciation with a mid-single-digit increase, which approximately equates to a $20 million step-up, which is slightly lower than recent years, given prior depreciation of the packaging line of the ABA facility that was operational throughout all of fiscal '24. Outside of COGS, we expect marketing expense as a percent of net sales to be approximately 8.5%, which is lower than our unchanged medium-term algorithm of 9%. The change of marketing expense as a percent of net sales for fiscal '25 is driven by a shift in our marketing investment allocation with an overall focus on maximizing value. The investment shift is geared towards prioritizing our largest brands to support their continued momentum, followed by our high growth potential Next Wave brands and then thoughtful and deliberate investments to support our innovation pipeline and savings driven by efficiencies from our new media agency partnership announced in Q3 of fiscal '24. Rounding out beer operating margin drivers, we anticipate SG&A as a percent of net sales to be approximately 5%, in line with the medium-term algorithm we provided during our Investor Day. All in, this implies beer operating margins of approximately 39% as our Beer Business continues to generate best-in-class operating margins and year-over-year improvement as we close in on our medium-term targets. For our Wine & Spirits business operating income, we anticipate an overall COGS increase of mid to high-single-digits driven by less favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volumes and higher seller overhead and blend costs, partially offset by favorability in logistics and packaging costs as part of our cost savings initiatives. For marketing and other SG&A expense as a percent of net sales, we anticipate 9% and 10%, respectively, each slightly above our medium-term outlook driven by the adjustments to our marketing, pricing, and sales investments to drive top line growth and partially offset by organizational structure changes, both points previously referenced by Bill. In addition, we expect to face headwinds from unfavorable lapping of contractual distributor payments and lower compensation and benefits in FY'24. That said, this implies Wine & Spirits operating margins to contract to approximately 20% in fiscal '25 as we continue to navigate category headwinds and reset investments in certain marketing and sales activities. We believe our enhanced focus on execution and planned cost savings can provide margin improvement over the medium-term toward the targets outlined at our Investor Day in November. Corporate expense is anticipated to increase slightly as we continue to invest in the business while reducing third-party fees more broadly. We expect interest expense to be approximately $445 million to $455 million driven by higher weighted average interest rates, and we expect our comparable effective tax rate to remain unchanged coming in at approximately 18.5%. We expect non-controlling interest to be about $35 million and anticipated weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '25 to be around 183 million, inclusive of share repurchase activity. Based on these assumptions, we expect our reported EPS to be between $13.40 and $13.70 and our comparable EPS to be between $13.50 and $13.80, representing a 10% midpoint increase year-over-year. From a cash flow perspective, we expect our free cash flow in fiscal '25 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, reflective of $2.8 billion to $3 billion of operating cash flow net of CapEx spend of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the expansions of our existing breweries and the ongoing construction in Veracruz. We anticipate approximately $3 billion of remaining CapEx spend from fiscal '25 to fiscal '28, with fiscal '25 expected to be the peak spend year as we progress with the construction of our greenfield site in Veracruz. And consistent with our Investor Day messaging, we expect a step-up in free cash flow that should yield cumulatively between $7 billion to $9 billion from fiscal '26 to fiscal '28. To conclude, we ended fiscal '24 with strong results, driven by continued outstanding growth in our Beer Business, as its core brands reach new milestones in cases sold and market share. Our Wine & Spirits business faced difficult marketing conditions in FY'24, but we've identified key actions to improve execution and performance. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, we are confident that we can deliver against our plan with strong enterprise results aligned with our medium-term targets, execute our capital allocation priorities and seek to create value for our shareholders. We thank you for your ongoing support throughout fiscal '24 and look forward to updating you on our progress and success in fiscal '25. With that, Bill and I are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Hi, questioner. So we lost that questioner. Moving on to our next questioner is coming from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick ones for me. Just been getting a lot of questions about gross margin and wanted to get any perspective on if there's any one-time issues that might have affected the gross margin this quarter for beer. And then the second part of that is just when you think about the shipments this quarter, can you give us any context on how much might have been attributable to some, whether it be the Aguas Frescas launch into wholesale or preparing for some of the shelf resets that would be helpful. Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, Nick, I'll try to address both of those. First on the gross margins, as we laid out in our press release, we did have a bit of a write-off of a bad accrual as it relates to bad receivables in Q4. That impacted our Q4 operating margin by about 100 basis points. Obviously, that would have hit gross margin as well, and that impacted the full year by about 30 basis points, again, at the operating profit margin. As it relates to Q4 impact of Aguas Frescas' launch, very, very minimal impact, really just the strength of the portfolio more broadly is what drove Q4. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Second attempt. Can you hear me? Bill Newlands : Second time is the charm, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, great. So I wanted to touch on beer depletions, the nearest 7% result in the quarter, ex the extra day. It's a pretty solid result considering the weather. Can you just give us any sense for momentum so far in March and April when the weather normalized or maybe how big a drag January was in Q4? Just give us sort of a sense of underlying trends. And just on market share, you mentioned the shelf space gains being disproportionate this year, post-Bud Light struggles. How much of a positive impact are you expecting from that, and can you juxtapose that versus the risk that Bud Light trends get better, and you see some direct impact on your brands from that? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. We obviously take into account our March results with our overall expectations for the year. But I'd say, March was very consistent with what our expectations were. Everyone should keep in mind that March has two less selling days, April has two more. So we internally look at it as sort of the combo plan of those two months. With that said, we had a very comfortably strong March as we expected that we would, and think it's setting us off on a really solid year, as we said, consistent with what we said at the Investor Day in New York. As we also noted in my script, we had low-double-digit growth in our shelf sets here in the spring, greater than our growth algorithm, which is what we expected. And certainly, that's going to be one of the added values in our delivery of the total year. But as we've said, and as all of you know, incremental space, by and large, is not at the same velocity as what you have from existing velocity, because it's marginal returns. With that said, we're very pleased with the increase in our shelf position. We've said for many years, our brands really deserve it. They've averaged over $50 million per SKU in dollar return, and it certainly is reflective of what I'm sure all retailers are seeing and that our brands are driving the growth in the category. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, Garth. Good morning, Bill. So I guess, just stepping back, we had this question a couple of times this morning, and maybe the underlying question is just at an enterprise level we get back to being basically on algorithm for the year, but in a year where wine and spirits underdelivers beer, at least in terms of growth rate on operating profit, maybe a little faster than normal, a little help from below-the-line on interest expense. So just is it a coincidence, right, that basically there can be a hole with wine and spirits underdelivering, but there were other offsets? Or was this more a function of you all maybe making some adjustments to get to that place, whether it's pulling some savings forward or using some tax credits? I think people are just trying to understand how much manipulation or how much work you had to do to sort of make up the difference or whether this was just a coincidence. Bill Newlands : No, Bryan, we don't play with the numbers. The numbers reflected very strong results in our Beer Business. As we've said, we've had some challenges in our Wine & Spirits business. As you know, we just installed a new President of our Wine & Spirits business whose focus will be on execution. We have a number of things in this coming year that will cause it to be a bit of a reset year at the bottom line because we're lapping a number of one-time issues, but that isn't going to stop us from delivering on the enterprise-wide results that we committed to in New York and that we are reiterating today. We expect to continue to show best-of-class results. As you heard in my remarks, last year, we again were the number one growth company in Circana large companies as we have been five of the last seven years, and that is what's really driving the success of our business, not anything else. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Sorry. Good morning. I was just curious, you gave a lot of help and color on the Wine & Spirits, but I was just curious and we've heard in the industry more about, you spoke last quarter about promotional pressures, other manufacturers have talked about retailer destocking, seeing more inventory management at the distributor level. Just curious to hear your take on kind of the promotional environment and kind of state of the union on inventory levels within the system, knowing it's tough to have visibility within three-tier, but just curious your view on inventory in the system online? Bill Newlands : Yeah, you bet. We did see some inventory reduction this past fiscal year, particularly in Canada. There was quite a bit of inventory realignment in Canada, and certainly there has been some that we've seen in the US as well. The thing that I think is important for us to continue to focus on is we've made a number of changes. We're going to focus on those 11 brands that are really the biggest drivers of our success. That's a bit of a change. Frankly, we've probably peanut buttered our efforts a little too broadly in the past, and we're going to focus on those brands that we believe have real growth potential for the long term. We're also going to do a bit more promotional spend than we have in the past, particularly on brands like Woodbridge, where that's an important part of the consumer dynamic. A lot of work and research has been done in the last few months to make sure that we understand all the consumer dynamics around our critical brands and we will execute against those dynamics in this coming year. And I think that's reflective of an improved top line that you see this year, acknowledging there'll be a bit of a reset at the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So Garth, thank you for all the perspective on expectations around beer margins for the full year. Can you just perhaps expand a little bit on what specifically is driving the commodity input inflation, number one? And then secondly, if I put all this together, it does feel like maybe there's a little bit of top line leverage you're expecting or you need a little bit more savings on the G&A line to get to the low-double-digit number for the full year in the division. So maybe just help provide any context on that. So thanks on the commodities and maybe just some of the assumptions on how you're getting to the operating profit number for the full year. Thanks so much. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so just as it relates to margins for beer I think that, first of all, I think we have to acknowledge that if you look at the past two years, and you look at the disruptions we saw to global supply chains and then the elevated inflation environment that we've been dealing with, that the improved margins, starting in the back half of our fiscal '24, and then moving forward with significant margin expansion in FY'25 to get near the low-end of our target range I think that that's no small feat. As we look forward to FY'25, we're going to face similar tailwinds and headwinds that we have for the last several years. The tailwinds, again, will be volumetric growth given the strength of our brands, as well as our typical pricing algorithm. Some of the issues that we'll face or headwinds that we'll face is that while commodity prices have certainly abated from their highs, they're certainly sort of higher still than their historical norms or near-term historical norms. And there have been a couple of commodities that have been a bit resilient in their strength, if you will, or haven't come down nearly as much as we would have hoped. So we still face those. In addition, we have the strength of the peso, which is something that we're going to continue to manage through. Fortunately, we're hedged as we enter the year against the peso at about 80%, so we're going to manage that effectively. And as you've heard us talk about extensively, both on this call and Investor Day, we have this year, as well as have had last year, an aggressive set of cost savings initiatives that will help benefit the business. So all in, I mean, we think that there's fairly significant margin expansion here, margin growth, in FY'25 as we move towards getting closer to our mid-term growth algorithm or mid-term margin algorithm. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi. Just one quick follow-up on the shelf space question. You've gained a lot of shelf space already. Can you maybe just give a sense of how much incremental space do you expect as we think about this spring? And then secondly, it looks like the strategic or I guess the evaluation on Wine & Spirits is complete. To what degree did you consider divestments as part of it, either for pieces of that business or maybe even for the whole thing? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure. As I stated, Kaumil, on our -- in my primary remarks, well, low-double-digit shelf space is what we expected to get, and that's in fact what we are getting in spring resets. Obviously, it varies all over the map depending, but that's roughly what the total number is in the aggregate. And again, that's at least as much as we expected. We're very pleased with where that landed. Relative to the Wine & Spirits business, we've made this comment a number of times. The person that drinks across all three categories, beer, wine, and spirits, spends six times as much as an individual that drinks only in one of those three categories. Therefore, we continue to feel that that's important, that we are accessing significant additional consumer occasions and consumer spending by being able to play in all three of those categories. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Nadine Sarwat : Thank you. Two interrelated questions from me. First, you obviously posted very robust beer volume growth this quarter. What are you seeing in terms of the health of the US consumer today? Any signs of the downtrading or shift in behavior? And then a second question also on the consumer. Some of your industry peers have highlighted dry January being more meaningful headwind this year. Other commentators are calling out different drinking patterns amongst younger legal drinking-age consumers. So I'd be really curious to hear what you are observing when it comes to these trends. Any changes in behavior from the consumer? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure, Nadine. We're very pleased with the health of our consumer. We've said many, many times, the brand loyalty that we have within our franchise is superb. And I think that's really important. I think when you put that together with the fact that, and Garth has mentioned this on a number of occasions, we've been judicious in our pricing strategy over the last few years, which is a little bit different from what some other people have done in CPG industries, but we think that's important to maintain that consumer base given the very strong loyalty that we have within our franchises. It's also important to note that the high-end, which is the only place where we compete in beer, continues to see an increase in buy rate. So that, again, speaks to the fact that the consumer continues to premiumize and we're in the perfect position to take advantage of that particular point. Relative to any consumer changes in January and so on, one of the things that we've noted a couple of times is betterment. We've done a number of things in our wine business to bring out light or lighter products like Illuminate and Kim Crawford and Bright in Meiomi. Similarly, our Corona Non-Alcoholic had a great start. It was the number one share gainer in the non-alcoholic segment and I think that does reflect some change in consumer behavior or people that are concerned about being the designated driver, but still want to enjoy an outstanding tasting beer. We're going to continue to emphasize the betterment trends as we go forward with a number of our product offerings and certainly expect Corona Non-Alcoholic to continue to grow here in this coming fiscal year as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Drew Levine : Hey, good morning. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our questions. So just two for us, if we may. Just going back to one of the earlier questions, Bill, if you can comment maybe on depletion trends outside of California versus inside California during the quarter and how those progressed throughout the quarter. And then one for Garth. I think you mentioned roughly $200 million of cost savings for beer in fiscal '24. I think that implies a pretty meaningful step up in the fourth quarter. So if you could just talk about maybe some of the projects where you saw benefit and how we should be thinking about cost savings for fiscal '25. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Andrea, your voice got a lot lower since the last time you asked a question. All joking aside, our trends were very, very strong really across the country. A significant place, let me use Pacifico as an example, the depletions across that brand for the year were up 17%, and obviously, the big stronghold is California. Modelo Especial continues to be the number one brand in the State of California. But we're also seeing really good success across the country. Places like Texas and Florida. And secondary markets. We've always said secondary markets are going to be an important element for us. And many, many, many of those showed double-digit increases over this past year. So we were very pleased to see a broad-based growth profile for our business as we closed out the year, and we think we're in position to continue to do that here in fiscal '25. Garth, I think, the second one was for you. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, just on the roughly $205 million of cost savings that came out of Beer Business throughout the year. Yeah, that ramped up throughout the year. We started right out of the gate very strong in Q1 and again that ramped up as we went through the year. It ramped up as we went through the year really based on two factors. One is, we identified or put in place new initiatives throughout the year. But then you also benefited from -- almost from a compounding perspective for those things that started earlier in the year as well. The kinds of initiatives that we undertook last year were procurement-related in terms of various RFPs around raw materials where we were able to address some of the outsized increases that we saw over the last two years due to global supply chain disruptions as well as the inflationary environment. There was a number of logistics initiatives in terms of rail cars and double stacking and also a number of operational initiatives that were underway. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. First, could you please just remind us what your gross dollar amount of expenses that are peso-denominated are? So that would be great. And then second, looking at the scanner data and this is Circana, your price/mix has been well below the beer category over the last four, 12 weeks or so. So I'm trying to understand why that's the case. And the most of the other players took pricing kind of before or after the Super Bowl. Kind of what is the timing on your price increases this year? And again, why is your apparent realization in the scanner data less than the market and most of the other big brands? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Yeah, so on the first one, in terms of the amount of costs that are peso-denominated for our Beer Business is about 20% to 25% of our costs are peso-denominated. As I said, as we entered this year, we're hedged at about 80%. Bill Newlands : And relative to price realization, as you know, a lot of what you see in these types of things depends on when pricing increases or pricing actions were taken. We consistently have said 1% to 2% is our pricing algorithm, and over the course of the whole year, we're still expecting to see 1% to 2% pricing actions. As you also know, Robert, we do that on a SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market basis, and therefore, you have reflections of different time frames across the year as to when that actually shows up. I don't think that's anything that we are concerned about nor any kind of an ongoing trend. And as we said, over the course of the year, we'll expect to get 1% to 2% as we've communicated we would. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. I had a question on the overall beer industry and your thoughts as we are about to cycle the big market share shift with the controversy around Bud Light in April of last year. Clearly, your business was growing at these rates well above before this controversy, but there are some concerns that you might have benefited from the market share shift, so maybe you can address some of the impact that you see on your business and how you're thinking about it as we start to cycle those impacts. Thank you. Bill Newlands : Well, as we've said right along, we probably were not the single biggest gainer as it related to the controversy that you know, but I'd also, again, continue to point out something I said earlier, which is, we've got extraordinarily strong brand loyalty, and we only play in the high-end. The high-end is where the growth in the category is at the moment, and we're fortunate that that's exactly where we play. When you add in the fact that we've seen a significant increase in our shelf presence here during this spring reset program, we think we're in a great position, recognizing we are coming off the single biggest share gain in the history of Constellation Brands Beer Business. Two points in all total beer and 2.6 points in the high-end. It's an unprecedented gain and I think it reflects the sheer strength of our brands. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Gerald Pascarelli : Great. Thanks very much. Just going back to wine, Bill, the drivers you laid out in your prepared remarks were very helpful, but based on current trends, I think the outlook for the year came in above expectations, definitely above our expectations. So, I guess, in the context of two guide downs last year, if you could maybe provide some more commentary just on your level of confidence this early in the fiscal year in achieving flat revenue performance, that would be great. And then does your outlook embed the assumption that the wine category will ultimately start to improve from current levels this year? Thank you. Bill Newlands : I think, obviously, Garth and I spent a lot of time with our wine colleagues over the last few months looking carefully at what we thought was critically important. The reflection of an improved performance has several variables involved. One, we're going to work much more closely and enhance our sales capabilities to support our distributor network. I think we've gotten much more aligned as to what our intentions and expectations are, both from distributor to us and us to distributor than where we had been as we came out of last year. Second, we've refocused our priorities. There are 11 or so critical brands that did not probably have the right amount of prioritization within our overall portfolio, and we have radically addressed that. Third, we're going after efficiencies within the business, and we think there are those to be had. As you know, that was a tremendous success last year in our Beer Business, and we're putting some of the same resources against our Wine & Spirits business that helped generate that very strong result last year. So there's a number of elements that we are putting in place recognizing this is going to be a bit of a reset year, particularly at the bottom line for the wine business. However, again, we've said, we think the strategy is sound, it's right, it's going to get us to our medium-term algorithms as we go forward, and at this point, it's all about execution. And I think Sam Glaetzer and the rest of the team are going to be crystal focused on execution against our strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please proceed with your question. Carlos Laboy : Yes, good morning, everyone. Can you please expand further on the state of on-premise activity that you saw towards your end, and more important, currently? Bill Newlands : You bet, Carlos. I think you saw some interesting volatility, depends on the particular time frame, and we saw some of that. We had an issue for a brief period during this year where we had some issues with kegs, which is now fully behind us. We're continuing to see strong development in the on-premise, and we're particularly excited about it heading into Cinco, which is obviously the next big time frame for us, and a time frame when we historically have done very well and made significant share gains, both in the retail and in the on-premise environment. So we're very optimistic that the on-premise is going to be an important part of what our results are this year. Both Modelo, Corona, Extra and Pacifico are all growing share in that channel and we expect that that continued share of growth is going to continue in this fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll hand the floor back to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Rob, and thank you to all who joined today's call. As we wrap up, I want to, once again, thank our colleagues across Constellation, as well as our trade partners, for delivering another strong year of performance in fiscal '24. Your continued focus and discipline has made Constellation a top-performing growth leader among CPG companies for 11 consecutive years. No other company in recent times can say that, and we're extremely proud of this achievement. As we head into fiscal '25, we're confident in our ability to further build on our momentum and to create additional shareholder value by delivering low-double-digit EPS growth, fueled primarily by our Beer Business, which we expect to generate high-single-digit net sales growth and best-in-class operating margins. Heightened focus on our commercial and operational execution in our Wine & Spirits business, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation and continuing to serve as good stewards of our environment and the communities where we operate. As we approach the key summer selling season, we invite you to enjoy some of our great-tasting products as part of your festivities, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next quarterly call. Thank you very much, and have a good day, everybody. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Joseph Suarez, SVP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Joseph Suarez : Thank you, Daryl. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q1 fiscal '25 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, and as Daryl mentioned, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance and now here's Bill. Bill Newlands : Thanks, Joe, and welcome all to our Q1 fiscal '25 earnings call. I'm pleased to say that we got off to a solid start in Q1. And as usual, I'd like to start with a few key highlights for the quarter. First, we continued to extend our position as a growth leader within consumer packaged goods, achieving an enterprise dollar sales increase 4.5 percentage points above that of the entire CPG sector. Let me repeat that. We achieved an enterprise dollar sales increase 4.5 percentage points above that of the entire CPG sector per the Circana tracked channel data for the 12 weeks ended on their May 19 quad week. This significant outperformance was largely driven by the continued growth of our Beer business, which attained the second largest share gain in the total beverage industry, as well as once again the top share gain in all beverage alcohol. This is for the Circana 12 weeks ended June 2, which most closely aligns with our quarter. Second, continuing with our Beer business. We delivered another strong quarter with high-single digit net sales increase driven by our Beer portfolio's 57th consecutive quarter of depletion growth, as well as significant operating margin improvement supported by our cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives. And, of course, all of this was aligned with our full year guidance and our medium-term outlook for the business. Third, in-line with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities, which we have consistently delivered against for more than five years now, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we did several things. First, we maintained our strong investment grade balance sheet and still expect to achieve our target 3 times net leverage ratio in fiscal '25. Second, we returned $185 million to shareholders in dividends and executed $200 million in share repurchases, plus we completed over $40 million more dollars of buybacks in June. Third, we continued to advance our latest brewing capacity addition at Obregon and new brewery development at Veracruz. And we are pleased to have executed the divestiture of our Mexicali site, which as a reminder was mainly the land building as we had already repurposed most of the equipment. Fourth, we executed the tuck-in acquisition of SeaSmoke to address white space and enhance asset utilization in our wine portfolio. And in parallel, initiated a potential sales process of a few wine and spirits non-core assets, including certain vineyards and facilities to better align our network and partially offset the acquisition cost. Staying with Wine and Spirits for a moment, while the performance of the business continues to face near-term challenges largely driven by broader category headwinds, we expect net sales and operating income improvements and our outlook for the fiscal year is unchanged. Lastly, all in, we drove comparable earnings per share growth of more than 17% and remain focused on achieving our stated full year guidance and medium-term target of low double-digit comparable EPS growth. With that, let's turn more fully to our Beer business' performance. We maintained the momentum in our Beer business during the first quarter of fiscal '25 with net sales and operating income growth of more than 8% and nearly 16%, respectively. As noted earlier, these increases were primarily supported by strong volume growth as well as cost and operational efficiencies. Our Beer business grew shipments by 7.6% in Q1 on a reported basis, while depletions were up 6.4% excluding the impact of the craft brand divestitures in June of last year. It is important to reiterate that this mid to high-single digit level of volume growth was fully aligned with the expectations we shared for our fiscal year, as well as our medium-term algorithm. So, despite the volatility of short-term scanner data, be it due to weather, timing of holidays or other non-structural factors or the performance of the broader beer category, be that due to dynamics affecting other brands or segments, our Beer team once again consistently delivered on our targets and objectives. Now honing in on the performance of our largest brands, Modelo Especial grew depletions by nearly 11% and upheld its position as the top share gainer, extending its lead as the number one beer brand in U.S. tracked channels. Importantly, Modelo Especial also continues to grow household penetration, rising to become the number three brand on this metric at the end of May, with a 2.4 percentage point increase on a 52 week basis. While Corona Extra depletions declined just over 1% in Q1, we continue to expect, we can deliver low-single digit growth from this brand. Importantly, Corona Extra remains a top five beer brand in the U.S. and it continues to gain share in the category. Pacifico delivered remarkable depletion growth of over 20% and was the number four dollar share gainer across the total beer category. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of more than 5% in depletions and we are excited to continue to build on that momentum in fiscal '25 with two new flavors, Fresa Picante and Negra con Chile. More broadly, from an innovation pipeline perspective, the rollout of our two new Modelo Oro pack sizes is underway, as we continue to thoughtfully build out the brand using our disciplined approach after a successful national launch last year. In addition, the expansion of our Aguas Frescas variety pack to an additional 20 markets and the launch of Corona Sunbrew in select Eastern test markets are also advancing per our plans and we look forward to sharing more on these additions to our portfolio over the coming year. The strong execution of our Beer business in Q1 was also reflected in our ability to deliver significant operating leverage, driving 2.6 percentage points of operating margin expansion year-over-year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our Beer business to deliver net sales growth of 7% to 9%, operating income growth of 10% to 12% and an operating margin of approximately 39% in fiscal '25. Moving on to Wine and Spirits. As noted earlier, we continue to face challenging dynamics in these categories, particularly across most of the wine price segments. These headwinds were the main drivers of the 7% net sales decline for that business in Q1. That said, our craft spirits portfolio achieved shipment volume growth of 14% as well as double-digit dollar sales growth in Circana U.S. track channels, significantly outperforming the low-single digit growth rate of the higher-end spirit segment. In addition, we continue to make good progress against the operational and commercial execution initiatives identified last quarter to support our efforts to improve the performance of this business in fiscal '25. The tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75% of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our Wine and Spirits business in fiscal '24 are now underway and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year, ultimately underpinning the relatively stable net sales outlook for that business in fiscal '25. However, these incremental investments did have a near-term impact on the operating income, which declined 25% in the first quarter. That said, we also expect year-over-year operating income performance of our wine and spirits business to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we continue to target Wine and Spirits operating income to be down 9% to 11% in fiscal '25. As we have noted previously, we remain committed to continuing to advance this business over the coming years towards the medium-term target shared in our Investor Day. Lastly, we continue to make-good progress against our ESG ambitions, having recently received TRUE Certification for Zero Waste at our Nava and Obregon breweries, marking a significant milestone in meeting our waste reduction commitment. And as a reminder last year, we also achieved our initial water restoration commitment one year ahead of schedule and we then set an ambitious target nearly 5 times the size of the original goal to be completed within the same timeframe of fiscal '23 to '25. So in closing, we once again delivered another quarter of solid performance driven by the continued strength of our Beer business and we expect to maintain this momentum throughout the rest of fiscal '25 and beyond as committed at Investor Day. Our Beer business continues to achieve strong volume growth, well above that of its category and total beverage alcohol. This outstanding performance supported the second largest dollar share gain within the broader beverage industry and reinforced our significant growth outperformance relative to the entire CPG sector. Our Wine and Spirits business is making progress against the operation and commercial execution initiatives identified last quarter to support its trajectory for this year's guidance. All in, we continue to advance toward our enterprise wide financial targets, including the delivery of double-digit comparable EPS growth, while upholding our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities from the last five years, which so far this fiscal year has also included the return of over $240 million to shareholders in share repurchases through June. And with that, I turn the call over to Garth. Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion of our Q1 fiscal '25 performance will focus mainly on our comparable Enterprise results accompanied by business segment details. Starting with our Enterprise net sales, we delivered top-line growth of 6% for the quarter, in line with our full year expectations and our medium-term outlook for our Investor Day targets. As anticipated, this strong growth was driven by our Beer business, which I will elaborate on shortly. For fiscal '25, we continue to expect Enterprise net sales to grow between 6% to 7%. Enterprise operating income increased 23% and 12% on a reported and comparable basis, respectively. This resulted in a 35.4% operating -- reported operating margin and a 180 basis point year-over-year increase in comparable operating margin to 34.7%. While we delivered very strong operating income growth in the first quarter, again driven by our Beer business, we continue to expect Enterprise comparable operating income growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. At an Enterprise level, we also remain on track to achieve our full year comparable EPS guidance of $13.50 to $13.80, having delivered comparable EPS of $3.57 for the first quarter. As a reminder, our full year comparable EPS guidance represents a 10% increase year-over-year using the mid-point of our range. Importantly, these comparable EPS results and expectations are also consistent with our medium-term annual low double-digit comparable EPS growth target we outlined at our Investor Day last November. Now, turning to the more detailed discussion of the underlying drivers of our Q1 performance. Starting with our Beer business, the segment is off to a great start in fiscal '25. Our Beer business grew depletion volumes by 6.4%, excluding the impact of last year's craft brand divestitures, which will be the basis of our depletion figures this year to eliminate any sequential distortions from lapping periods without the craft brands. This reflected the solid consumer demand during the quarter, as well as the strong execution and performance during the key Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays. As usual, we led Cinco de Mayo and we are pleased to have once again won the Memorial Day holiday as the top share gaining supplier in Circana dollar sales, growing 6.3% and gaining 1.6 share points of total beer and 1.8 share points of high end beer. Modelo Especial was the top share gaining brand, picking up 1 share point and we had a total of five out of 15 top share gaining brands. Our on-premise depletions grew 2% as we continued to capture tap handles and gain share as demonstrated by Modelo Especial, shifting up one spot to now be the number four beer on draft in the U.S. Beer shipment volume for the quarter increased 7.6% and ran slightly ahead of depletions on both a growth rate and on an absolute basis. This is aligned with our usual seasonality as distributor and retailers prepare for the peak summer season. That said, from a full year perspective, we continue to expect absolute shipments and depletion volumes to closely align with each other. And in terms of the quarterly cadence of our volumes in fiscal '25, we still anticipate the quarterly share of full year shipment volumes and depletion volumes to be largely aligned with that of fiscal '24. Lastly, regarding selling days for our Beer business, they were flat for the first quarter of fiscal '25. For the balance of the year, we will have one less selling day, which will occur in Q2. In addition to the shipment volume growth, we realized pricing benefits of less than 1% due to lapping the wrap-around impacts of the pricing actions we took in the fall of calendar year 2022, which were above our normal pricing algorithm. Altogether, volume growth combined with price/mix benefits drove net sales growth of more than 8% for our Beer business. As we look towards the balance of fiscal '25, from a top-line perspective for our Beer business, we anticipate the momentum of our portfolio to continue. The shelf space gains we captured this past spring and our ongoing pursuit of additional points of distribution across the country are in line with what we outlined during our Investor Day. In addition, the opportunities across our disciplined innovation launches and the demographic tailwinds from Hispanic consumers who have high affinity and strong loyalty for our brands, as well as the incredible equity of our brands underpinned by our consistent marketing efforts give us further assurance that our top-line performance is sustainable. Moving on to operating income and operating margin performance for our Beer business. This segment delivered 16% growth in operating income and a 260 basis point increase in operating margin to 40.6%. These increases were largely driven by the strong top-line growth of our Beer business, as well as a nearly $50 million benefit from our savings and efficiency initiatives, which partially offset an increase in COGS of 7% excluding these savings, but inclusive of the impact of volume and foreign currency. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our total COGS are exposed to the Mexican peso and we are approximately 85% hedged against that exposure for the fiscal year. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 8.4% for the quarter, relatively in line with our full year expectation of approximately 8.5%. Other SG&A expense was 4.4% as a percent of net sales, slightly under our full year expectation as we expect an uplift in the second half due to lower fixed cost absorption, as well as talent acquisition and integrated supply chain investments. We continue to expect Beer operating margins of approximately 39% for fiscal '25. And from a cadence perspective, we anticipate incremental COGS relative to net sales in H2 due to lower fixed cost absorption from normal volume seasonality with some favorability in Q4 from lapping the VAT write-off in the same period last year. Shifting to our Wine and Spirits business. The segment realized a 7% net sales decline in the first quarter. This was largely driven by a 5.1% decrease in shipment volume as marketplace dynamics in U.S. wholesale remain challenging, particularly in the wine category. That said, we continue to expect that the operational and commercial execution initiatives identified in Q4 of last fiscal year and set underway in our recently completed Q1 should help us more effectively navigate the broader category and segment headwinds to ultimately deliver relatively stable year-over-year net sales performance in fiscal '25. Note, however, that we expect the top line performance uplift in our Wine and Spirits business to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, aligned with the usual seasonality of the business and as the benefits of our commercial and operational execution initiatives begin to take hold. From an operating income perspective, our Wine and Spirits business realized a decline of approximately $20 million, which in-turn resulted in a 370 basis point decrease in operating margin to 15.3%. These declines were primarily driven by unfavorable cost of goods sold, lower volumes and unfavorable product mix due to category headwinds extending into higher priced segments, which more than offset the favorable impacts of SG&A expense and favorable pricing. The unfavorable COGS relative to the net sales was primarily driven by higher grape and low end spirits costs, partially offset by cost savings realized in freight and warehousing. Our marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 10.5%. This was elevated when compared to our medium-term target due to ongoing marketing investments around some of our largest brands, particularly through tactical initiatives. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.5%, which was also elevated when compared to our medium-term target as benefits of our SG&A savings initiatives are expected to be realized in future quarters. As we look towards the rest of the year for our Wine and Spirits business, while we expect improvement in our performance for both operating income and operating margin, we continue to anticipate a full year 9% to 11% decline in operating income for our initial fiscal '25 guidance. Rounding out the rest of the P&L. corporate expense for the quarter was approximately $59 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of $9 million or 18%, largely driven by higher compensation and benefits, and professional fees. Interest expense for the quarter was $103 million, a 14% decrease from the prior year and our comparable effective tax rate was 18.2% compared to 20.7% for the corresponding quarter last year. Our corporate expense, interest expense and comparable effective tax rate expectations for fiscal '25 remain unchanged at $260 million, $445 million to $455 million and 18.5%, respectively. We expect a marginal increase over the coming quarters in corporate expense, mainly due to an increase in compensation and benefits and digital capabilities investments. We also expect a slight uplift in interest expense due to lower capitalized interest from our Beer business expansions beyond Q1, any minor increase in our effective tax rate due to anticipated incremental contributions from our Wine and Spirits business to our Enterprise operating income. Turning to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter of fiscal '25, we generated free cash flow of $315 million, a 19% decrease from the prior year as capital expenditures increased 35%, primarily driven by the construction of our greenfield brewery in Veracruz. That construction is progressing as planned And similar to all of our recent expansions, we believe will enhance our production capacity, product redundancy and overall efficiency for our Beer business. We expect our new brewery to be operational towards the end of next fiscal year or in the earlier part of fiscal '27. To conclude, the excellent Enterprise results were achieved in the first quarter of fiscal '25 support our confidence and our ability to deliver on our financial and strategic objectives for the full year, as we continue to leverage our strong portfolio of brands, relentlessly pursue operational excellence and remain consistent and adhering to our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities. That said, as we always do, we will continue to closely monitor the consumer, currencies and our input costs and to take appropriate action in response to any potential volatility or macro headwinds. As always, we thank you for your continued support and interest in our company and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With that, Bill and I will be happy to take your questions during our Q&A session. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Yeah. Hi, Good morning. So, Bill, Garth, you elaborated -- you commented on the continued momentum in beer and disciplined marketing efforts leading to sustainability of growth. I think, we are all hoping to hear from you a little bit of how you exit the quarter. Any June commentary so far given the state-of-the consumer, given all we are hearing from other companies and the economy in general? So if you can comment on that? And related to that, like I think we all hope that you are benefiting from all the shares and expansion in distribution? And if you can kind of tell us like a little bit of how you benefited from -- in the depletions that you just reported at 6.4%, how much you would say came from same shelf growth or how much was additional distribution? Thank you. Bill Newlands : Sure. Let me start with that. First of all, I think the important thing to always keep in mind is that our buy rates for our Beer business remain very strong. We saw high-single digit both at a consumer level and within the Hispanic community, with the Hispanic community being slightly higher than the total consumer. Now that doesn't mean there aren't some shift around in pack sizes and channels, but our buy rates remain extremely strong. And I think this is a consistent theme that we've said time -- frankly, time and time again, which is our Beer business has tremendous brand loyalty and therefore it continues to excel despite whatever might be going on with other beer companies or with other brands in the sector. As we noted, we had an unusually strong performance against all other CPG sectors and we're again the number one share gainer within beverage alcohol. To your point, I think the gains that we saw in shelf sets is certainly an additive factor in this. It also gives us plenty of chance to expand things like Oro, which we're very excited about for this fiscal year. So I think it's very difficult to put an exact number on the dimension of it. And I think you've seen, we've consistently delivered year after year after year on exactly what we said we would do and this quarter is no different. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please proceed with your question. Carlos Laboy : Yes. Hello, everyone. You've been able to sustain pretty good profit margins or pretty stable profit margins here remarkably well despite the Mexican peso having appreciated very strongly in recent years, but that seems to have turned this quarter. If you were to enter a period of pace of weakness, can you speak to the sort of flexibility that this might give you or that would enter into your pricing strategy? And look, just to be transparent, the reason I'm asking is because in the 80s and 90s, we went through periods of peso weakness and you were able to successfully close price gaps with mainstream beer and the dividends of that are still coming through today. So if you could just speak to how you're thinking about this, it would be helpful. Bill Newlands : Yeah, Carlos. I think the results that you referenced are just an indication of how effective our hedging policies really are. We have a multi-year hedging policy which allows us to layer in incremental hedges over a multi-year period when we see moments of weakness, if you will. In Q1, we actually did see a couple of days there where there was some fairly significant movements, greater than 10%. And we took advantage of that movement with our treasury team again layering in incremental hedges, not just for this year, but also for future years as well. Just as a reminder, when we entered this fiscal year, we were about mid-70% range hedged against the peso. And as a result of these incremental hedges, we now sit at about 85% for the full-fiscal year. So again, it's a very robust practice, very methodical, disciplined and flexible approach and it certainly been paying dividends for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So just to follow-up on Andrea's question in terms of macros and potential impact on the Beer business, can you unpack a little more maybe what you're seeing from low versus middle versus high-end consumers in terms of demand for your Beer business? And then also just any update on on-premise channel trends and what you're seeing throughout the course of fiscal Q1 and so far this summer, just in terms of if we're seeing any big channel shifts or any types of impact on that front? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Sure, Dara. Let's start with the second question first. The on-premise was slightly weaker than what we might have expected. Although as you saw, we had some significant gains within our franchises, particularly Modelo, which stepped up a position versus what we had in prior years. I think some of that relates to couple of things. One is, as many people have noted, the weather scenario that existed over the course of the early part of the spring/beginning of summer, while it wasn't great, which impacts the on-premise, much like it impacts the overall business. So I think that was a bit of a play. But as we are getting into the summer months, we expected this to show some resiliency. I'd reemphasize to your question about where the consumer is at various price points -- excuse me, income points. I think yet again, this goes right back to what I said in answer to her question, which is the brand loyalty that exists with our consumers is second to none. I mean, when you look at the Hispanic consumer, which is one we watch very closely given it's more than 50% of our overall mix, that consumer buy rate was up compared to the total consumer. Again, I think that speaks very strongly to the loyalty that we see within that consumer base, irrespective of income. That in particular is a long range benefit for our business and will continue to be a long range benefit to our business given that community in many respects views beer as a stable. So again, overall, we continue to be very pleased with our buy rates. And despite gives and takes during the course of the quarter, I think it's reflected in our depletion rate of 6.4%. It's a very strong quarterly result. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good morning, everyone. First, just a quick follow up on Andrea's question, if you can just provide any update on just what you're seeing exiting the quarter into June. And then a bigger picture question on innovation. Last year, obviously, you had Modelo Oro, which was pretty successful and you have some runway for this year. Can you talk a bit about this year's innovation including Corona Sunbrew and the Modelo Aguas Frescas expansion and anything else we should think about in terms of innovation contribution in beer. Thank you. Bill Newlands : You bet. And as we've said in other quarters, we're not going to give quarterly depletion guidance. But what I will say is we're very pleased with the status of the weather going into this particular quarter. And as we've always said, that's really a big factor in terms of the delivery of the business. And quite frankly, the forecast for tomorrow is terrific. So we're looking-forward to the July 4, being yet another event in a weekend and weekday in this case that we will win, much like we did on Memorial Day before it. So relative to the innovation agenda, we have expanded Modelo Aguas Frescas to 20 additional markets. As you may recall, it was test marketed last year in Las Vegas and was the number-one FMB in that particular market, had a very strong start and that variety pack is now in 20 additional markets, which covers roughly 70%, 75% of the total consumption expected for that product. So we're very excited to watch that one develop as the year goes on. Similarly, we are testing Corona Sunbrew in the Northeast just -- again just getting started and it's very early days, but we're very pleased with their response to it. And certainly, much of the consumer sampling that's been done around that product suggests that, that product is going to be a home-run for us with the consumer. So, again, both of those are too early days to really have any, what I would call, concrete results. But as we always do, those were only introduced after significant testing at a consumer level to make sure that we had the right product, the right package and the right pricing mix to give them a very high probability of success. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So the strong start to the year on profitability would seemingly create more flexibility to hit that 10% to 12% operating profit guide for Beer for the year. Particularly there's nothing too material from a timing perspective in the quarter. So kind of what do you see as the key variables that influence the high versus the low-end of that operating profit guidance range from here? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Well, look, Lauren, we feel really good about the guidance we gave for the full-year. And obviously, we feel really good about the results that we reported today. As we gave guidance in April of this year, obviously we laid out that from a Beer perspective, we very much expected that our operating income growth would be in that 10% to 12% range and we certainly reiterated that today. That implying that our operating margins would be at about 38%. I think it's important to note that -- or 39%, I should say. I think it's important to note that we gave that guidance as it relates to the margin on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis. So that means that we won't necessarily hit 39% or approximately 39% every quarter. Certainly, we expect that there's going to be the normal seasonality that we see every year, which means we have higher volumes in the first-half of the year and then lower volumes in the second-half of the year just due to regular seasonality, which resulted in a bit of a fixed overhead absorption drag as well as the second-half of the year is when we do most of our maintenance on our breweries. So therefore, the second half of the year will be lower from a margin perspective than the first half of the year. That being said as we've noted previously, we do expect that in Q4 that we will see some favorability on a year-over-year basis due to the lapping of the VAT write-off of last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just more of a philosophical question. I mean, the sentiment on the beer category has been pretty poor for a while now. Obviously, investors see it, but the trade talks about it as well. And obviously, your business has been very disconnected from that. So I'm just curious like as you engage with your supply chain partners, distributors, retailers, what's the conversation look like? I mean, are they coming around the fact that maybe they can't index your business relative to the beer category anymore because there's a lot of moving pieces and cross consumption? It's really about occasions versus just some holistic category. I mean, I'm just curious like what that discussion looks like right now especially as you're in the middle of shelf resets and probably discussions for what's going on in the fall and even next year? Bill Newlands : And I'll have to start, Nik, by giving a little tip of the cap to you because you pointed out what we think is a critical point, which is this is all about brands. The reason our brands have gotten double-digit increase in their shelf position during this period of time is because of the strength of those brands and the takeaway. As we've said on prior calls, our average SKU takeaway in dollars is five times the rate of our cheap competitors. So if you're a distributor or you're a retailer, you're going to put the emphasis on where you get growth and profitability and growth in takeout and strong velocities. And our brands represent that. That's why you see Pacifico with 20% growth and being the number four share gainer. That's why you see Modelo Especial now being the number one play in off-premise dollar volume. Our brands are very strong and they stand out distinctively from other brands in the category and I think you've made that note many times and we happen to agree fully with that. Lastly, I'd say, we continue to invest in our brands. Part of what we are doing is we believe there's still significant upside on the longer-term in terms of our brands and the investment that we put behind them. Despite Modelo being number one, there's still a lot of awareness opportunity and we're planning to go get it. We feel the same way about things like Oro and Aguas Frescas and Sunbrew. We're bringing new scenarios and new occasions to more consumers. I think that all speaks to the strength of our brands. And I think whether you speak to retail or whether you speak to distributors, they're all very excited about our prospects, not only today, but for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys. Bill Newlands : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : I have just two questions. I guess the first one is just Garth or Bill. If you can just comment on Veracruz, I know you made a comment in the prepared remarks, but just how far along you are in the construction or do we have a foundation yet? Have we piped in water? Just some sense of kind of where you are and where that is relative to plan? And then I have a follow up. Bill Newlands : Well, Brian, I mean, as I said in my remarks, I mean we are well on our plan. We expect to open that brewery at the end of the next fiscal year, early in the fiscal year-after that. So we're well on our way. It is why our CapEx this year is at its peak. As a reminder, we shared with everybody at Investor Day that FY '25 would be our peak in terms of CapEx as that construction is kind of at full throttle. Importantly, our -- as this is our peak year of CapEx, we do expect that by the sort of end of our medium-term outlook, meaning FY '25, we'll go from CapEx kind of in the low double-digit range of net sales to mid-single-digit range of net sales. So just important for all of you to know and appreciate that. But as it relates specifically to Veracruz, we are on-track. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thanks. And then just a follow up on some of the earlier conversations. Bill, the stock is down today because I think there's a concern about the tough comparisons in beer, maybe a little bit of election concern because of how the stock reacted when Trump was elected in 2016. So could you just give us a first -- or a perspective on how you think about the comps? I mean, the comps were the comps when you set your plan. So it's not like they're a surprise. So if you can give us a perspective on that and whether or not people should actually even be worried about the election and who wins or loses relative to FTC? It's a different\u2026 Bill Newlands : Yeah. Sure. I think it's always risky and we've talked to many, many times, Garth and I have about this topic about getting too excited about what happened tomorrow morning rather than looking at the longer-range picture. Year after year after year now, we've delivered against the goals that we set out and we're not varying from our expectation from this year in part because of very strong performance that we delivered in Q1. As Garth noted in his remarks, that doesn't mean there aren't times when it's a little better or a little worse or you have a little variability because you have less sell days or you have various things that go on. I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. Our brands continue to perform year after year and the runway for those brands remains extraordinarily strong. I think that's going to be a true statement no matter who's elected in November. Our brands are really focused on delivering against the consumer and that consumer is incredibly loyal, as I said just a few minutes ago. That makes a big difference irrespective of who happens to be the President of the U.S. So we're certainly -- I might add and we've said this before as well, our government affairs team works very closely, both in the United States and in Mexico on both a federal and a local level. And I think that capability is one that's also advantageous to us again irrespective of any particular party that might happen to be in office at any particular time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So Garth, I was hoping to get some updated perspective on just kind of the puts and takes as it relates to the beer profit outlook. Back in April, you touched on volume leverage, price/mix, cost savings being tailwinds versus commodities and FX being headwinds. I mean I'd just be curious, have your expectations for those buckets changed at all over the last few months? I totally understand you've reiterated the outlook this morning, but just have the building blocks changed at all versus your prior expectations? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Well, thanks, Peter. I mean, I guess the shorter answer to that question is no. I mean, as I just laid out previously, we are -- we will see quarterly variability as we do every year, mostly driven due to seasonality, volume seasonality, certainly the building blocks that we laid out in detail at our April conference call, we were provided for full-year guidance, those remain where they are or what they are. As we noted a couple of times now, we are taking actions where we see that there's opportunity to take actions like making sure that we further hedge against the peso when we see weakness. But other than that, I mean, the business continues to be the business and the building block for the building blocks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hey. Thank you very much. I'm going to follow up on Peter's question there around gross margins in beer specifically. Garth, can you maybe frame how the Q1 gross margin came in relative to your expectations on paper? It certainly looks like strong delivery specifically in the context of the rest of the year. And then just regarding the commentary around taking advantage of the weaker peso, does that give you more confidence on this fiscal year? And how much can you actually take advantage of for fiscal '26 at this point? Thanks. Garth Hankinson : Yeah. So I would say that the gross margins kind of came in within our expectations just to give you a little bit of color around what drove that. We essentially saw about 100 basis-points of improvement in gross profit margin on a year-over-year basis. About 30% of that or 30 basis-points of that, I should say, is volume, price and mix driven. About 80 basis points are what I would just call cost of goods, logistics materials, labor, offset by depreciation and things of that nature. We got about a 20 basis points bump due to the craft divestiture and then we had about 30 basis points hit just due to the exposure against the FX that's unhedged. So that's really what the building blocks or not, the makeup of the changes. We feel really good about where we are for the balance of the year. Certainly, we continue to progress against our aggressive cost savings initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day. As I mentioned in my comments, we've already got $50 million or about $50 million in Q1 that we think is sustainable and we'll certainly continue to execute against the cost savings initiatives as we go through the balance of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on just marketing. Your outlook for marketing and advertising spend this year, it's below historical levels. And I guess there's some concern that you may be starving your brands. So could you touch on this and provide a little more color on the efficiencies you've gained and may continue to gain, how you're approaching investments this year? And I guess why you feel good about these investment levels? Thanks. Bill Newlands : Yeah. You bet, Bonnie. We're actually going to be spending more dollars this year than we have in prior years as you would expect because our brands demand it and our growth profile allows us to continue to do it. With that said, you did point out an important point is we have created some efficiencies within our spend and therefore the percentage is slightly less than we've done in prior years, purely driven by efficiency. That doesn't change the fact that we are spending more against our brands than we've ever spent and that process will continue. We strongly believe engaging our consumer with critical national media and digital advertising platforms are critically important to continue to create awareness and to bring consumers into our franchises. In fact, you're seeing spend against many of our new initiatives. You're seeing that against Sunbrew, you're seeing that against Aguas Frescas. We just kicked off our Oro spend for the year. We are very strongly supportive as we have been for many, many years against our brands and that process will continue. Garth Hankinson : Yeah. And if you don't mind me, Bill, I'll explain a little bit more. I mean, we've said this publicly multiple times now. We will continue to invest in the growth of our business, both in marketing just like we did, just like we do with the investments we're making in our brewery capacity. We will not starve our brands for marketing in order to hit a margin profile. Instead, we will continue to invest for growth. Bill Newlands : So since we're piling on, Garth, do you mind if I pile on too? Garth Hankinson : Yeah. Bill Newlands : One of the reasons why we saw the improvement in the Modelo penetration and the double-digit growth in Modelo's business in the quarter is exactly what we're just talking about, which is we spend against our business. That's why Modelo in 10 years has gone from a tiny little brand to the number-one brand by dollars in the United States. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Nadine Sarwat : Hi. Thank you. I want to come back to the November election. So former President Trump has mentioned the potential of a 10% universal baseline tariff should he win. Given your Mexican import beer business, how do you think that potential scenario would play out for Constellation? And how would you add color on the risk that it would place? Thank you. Bill Newlands : I think it's too early to speculate on what may or may not happen in November. Quite frankly, our business performed just great during the last Trump administration and I would expect that we would perform extraordinarily well in a new administration, irrespective of who might be at the helm of that administration. I think it's important to recognize. Our business includes inputs from -- heavy inputs from the upper Midwest in the United States as an integral part of what our overall package of inputs are in our business. Admittedly, there's a lot of flow, our biggest trading partner in this country is Mexico and I think that's likely to continue. And we're sure we'll be able to navigate anything that might occur just fine and we'll work aggressively to do just that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Two questions. One, terrific quarter, reiterated the guidance, a lot of confidence, stock down. Love to get your -- kind of renew your kind of your thoughts on share buybacks here with the stock, really not much higher than it was in 2018 which has got to be a huge disappointment to you, your management team and the Board and myself frankly since we've been recommending it. So that's question number one. And then question number two, I'd love to get your thoughts on just the beer industry overall, how it's been developing. And there was an earlier question, I think, on how you did in June. I'm not sure you answered that. If you're not comfortable talking about your performance in June, maybe the industry overall in June, whether it looked better sequentially than in May? Thank you. Garth Hankinson : Thanks, Rob. Hey, just in terms of the share buybacks, I mean, I think as Bill alluded to in his opening remarks, in Q1, we continued to make and show the same progress that we have over the last five years in terms of all of our capital allocation priorities that included our share buybacks. As Bill noted, we bought back $200 million worth of shares in the first-quarter. And then through the end of June, I bought back an additional $40 million plus. So we've continued to do what we said we would do. As we've come -- as we've come out of the Q1, we still have about $2.4 billion, $2.6 billion left on our share reauthorization and we will continue to use the same discipline that we have exercised over the last several years and by when we see periods of dislocation. Bill Newlands : And relative to your question about the overall beer category, certainly, it appears that there's been some positive momentum as we've come out of June. I think a lot of that relates to the development of the summer. We're heading into the peak summer selling season, which we're always excited to see given we tend to win all of the major holidays during those seasons and would expect to do so tomorrow as well. But certainly, it looks like there's been some improvement. I think a lot of that, we've covered this and you hate to note this too often, but the reality is there were a lot of sort of bad weather moments at key times around weekends and holidays over the first part of this calendar year, which certainly hasn't been beneficial for the category overall. But I got to go right back to what I said a couple of times already today, which is our brands have outperformed this category for a long, long-time and we expect that to continue because of the strong brand loyalty that we have amongst our consumers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll ask about wine. The guidance for the year implies a pretty substantial pickup in sales growth, I guess, in the second-half. What kind of visibility do you have with your distributors on how the commercial turnaround is going? Are they making bigger commitments about what they're willing to take on? And because it does it does imply a pretty steep ramp. Thanks. We already always said, especially after our prior quarter, that we were going to take nine to 12 months-to get our wine business back into the position that we expected to do. Bill Newlands : We're pleased with what the work that's been done. I think we're ahead of schedule on some of the operational points that we expect recognizing they're likely to be second-half loaded because once you put into work, you have to wait to get the results out of them. Second, I think we've seen some significant improvement in our engagement, particularly with our wholesale network. And we believe that's going to create good opportunity in the back-half of this year. Some of the re-expression of our marketing dollars that we have put in-place, you saw some of that play-out in that -- in terms of the early spend in this quarter are already showing some positive signs and we'll look-forward to reporting on those as we go-forward. But certainly, we expect the improvement in this business to be back-half loaded as we've said now a couple of times. I think the other thing to also recognize, both our international business and our DTC business are performing ahead of what we had planned. The place where we're still spending a lot of time and energy is on the wholesale portion, but we're working very closely with our key wholesale partners to deliver against those expectations. And I think fortunately, we are all on the same page about what needs to be done and what delivery we expect against that business as we progress through the year. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks. Bill Newlands : Thank you, Darryl, and thank you all again for joining today's call. We're certainly off to a solid start in fiscal '25 and clearly today brings a great buying opportunity for our stock. Our beer business continues to deliver excellent top-line performance underpinned by leading volume growth while achieving solid margin expansion through our cost-savings and operational efficiency initiatives. While our Wine and Spirits business continues to face challenging market dynamics, it is making progress on commercial and operational execution initiatives expected to drive improved performance. Altogether, at an enterprise level, we continue to significantly outperform the entire CPG sector with our strong volume-driven growth and we remain confident in our momentum and our outlook for the full-year, including delivery of our double-digit comparable EPS growth. And with that, I wish you all a happy 4th of July holiday and certainly hope that you contribute to our outstanding performance that we expect to have during this critical holiday period. Thank you all for joining the call and have a good summer. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
