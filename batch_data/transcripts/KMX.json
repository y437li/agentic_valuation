Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Robin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Katharine Kenny. You may begin your conference. Katharine W. Kenny: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2014 first quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me, as usual, are Tom Folliard, our President and CEO; and Tom Reedy, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.

[Operator Instructions] For your information, we also do still have a few spots open on our July 11 regular Analyst Day. Thanks so much. Tom? Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you saw, used unit comps for the first quarter grew 17% compared to last year. When you add in our non-comp stores, total growth in used units was 22%. This comp unit sales growth was due to an improvement in conversion supported by the continuation of better execution in our stores and a more favorable credit environment for the consumers. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 22% and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,216 remained stable with last year. Wholesale unit sales increased by 6%. This was largely due to the growth in our store base and a somewhat higher buy rate. At $979, our wholesale gross profit per unit was virtually unchanged from a year ago. Extended service plan revenues rose 26%, reflecting not only the growth in used unit sales with an increase in penetration as more customers decided to take advantage of our MaxCare offering. CAF quarterly income increased 16% to $87 million. Tom will give a little more detail on that in a moment. And all these factors contributed to a record quarter for CarMax with an increase in net earnings of 21% to $147 million and an increase in net earnings per diluted share of 23% to $0.64 a share. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to give a little more detail around CAF. Thomas W. Reedy: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, CAF income grew $12 million or 16% compared to our first quarter fiscal 2013, while our average managed receivables increased 21% to $6.2 billion. This portfolio growth was largely driven by strong origination volume over the last several quarters, which was supported by the expansion in CAF penetration, CarMax's sales growth and increases in the average amount financed. The growth in managed receivables outpaced earnings growth as the increase in loan volume was offset by the continued compression and spread between consumer contract rates and our funding costs. Weighted average contract rate for accounts originated in the quarter decreased to 7% compared to 8.9% in last year's first quarter. Remember, this has been occurring for over several quarters and the rate is down only slightly from Q4, which was at 7.1%. At these levels, finance margins remain strong and we believe our offers continue to optimize overall sales and profits for CarMax. The allowance for loan losses grew by $14 million or 31% to $61 million, and credit losses in the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. Consistent with experience over the past several quarters, over 90% of our customers received one or more finance offers. During the quarter, we did see a greater applicant flow at the top and bottom ends of the credit spectrum, which supported higher penetration for CAF and for our third-party subprime lenders. For CAF, net loans originating in the quarter rose 42% to over $1.1 billion, and net penetration was 41% compared to 36% in the first quarter of FY 2013. We believe this increase in penetration was due to higher applicant flow, higher conversion arising from both more attractive offers and better in-store execution and also greater retention of our finance customers as we observe continued low 3-day payoffs. Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 21% of our sales in the first quarter compared to 16% in last year's first quarter. We believe this increase is due to combination of factors : The higher volume of applicant flow I mentioned earlier; a higher conversion to sale due to more attractive offers from those subprime providers and to greater execution by our stores' associates; and some shifting of sales from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year due to the delay in tax refunds. Now I'll turn it back over to Tom. Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you. As far as mix in the quarter, sale of 5-year old and older vehicles as a percentage our total sales remained above 25%, very similar to last year. Sales of SUVs and trucks were also consistent in both periods at about 25% of total sales, as were sales of compacts and midsized vehicles at about 38%. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand. We reported solid overhead leverage for the quarter. Total SG&A increased by 14%, reflecting the 12% growth in our store base and higher variable expenses related to higher sales. SG&A per unit fell by $131 to $2,086 per car, driven by our 17% comp sales. In the first quarter, our average monthly web visits grew to 11.5 million, up more than 28% compared to last year's first quarter. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represent about -- now represent about 20% of our total visits. And visits utilizing our iPhone or Android app grew to nearly 9% of our traffic by quarter end compared to approximately 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. So those 2 combined, around 30% of total hits now to carmax.com. During the first quarter, we opened 3 stores, all in new markets : One in Harrisonburg, Virginia; 2 in Georgia, one in Columbus, one in Savannah. Just this week, we opened our fifth store in Houston, so that will be the second quarter, and we plan to open one more store in the second quarter, which will be another store in our Sacramento market. You may have also seen our press release. We announced 4 planned superstore openings for next year's first quarter : 3 are in new markets for CarMax, including Rochester, New York; Dothan, Alabama; and Spokane, Washington; and we will also open a store in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. At this time, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Given the strong performance you've seen this quarter and the last few quarters, would you or the board consider accelerating your new store growth opening plan? Thomas J. Folliard: We feel pretty comfortable with the growth plan that we've announced for the next few years. As we've talked about in the past, we tried to pick a growth plan that would allow us to both aggressively grow our store base and at the same time, continue to work hard on improving execution, which -- we've seen some great execution improvements here in the last year or so. We've made great progress on the last couple of years on cost reduction and our reconditioning area. We still think we have a little to go there, so we feel pretty comfortable with the growth pace. We think it's both aggressive but at the same time, allows us to continue to improve the existing business model. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I'm just wondering if, Tom, if you could talk to the factors that you think are driving improved conversion and execution in the store, if there have been any process changes or anything else you can talk to. Thomas J. Folliard: You know what, it's not really any one thing. We have a really terrific and dedicated group of associates that have worked on training and development for a long time, but I think that's more of a marathon than a sprint. So we've made tons of progress in the stores with specific training for both our sales consultants and our sales managers. And we have more to work with, with the favorable credit environment that Tom mentioned and about 90% of our customers are receiving an offer from one of the lenders, so there's a little more work with there. We have more tenure now in our sales consultant organization in general. We've just been around for a while. Some of our older stores have folks that have been with us for 10 or 15 years. So I just think it's a long, long process, and I think some of our efforts in training and development are really starting to pay dividends. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Or maybe you could -- is there anything you can highlight that's changed in the last quarter or 2 in terms of learnings from the next-gen store that you've sort of rolled out to the older stores? Thomas J. Folliard: No, there really hasn't been anything that we have rolled back yet. So this is all just again continuous improvement and continuous effort across a very big base of associates. And we're very proud of their efforts and clearly, it's paying some pretty good dividends. Operator : And your next question is from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : A question on CarMax Auto Finance. I guess it's a two-pronged question. I mean, obviously, the penetration there is extremely good at this point. I think in the low 40s, it's probably the highest that I have remembered seeing it. So if you could talk about kind of how high is high for CAF penetration, I mean, how much further can you push that? And then secondarily, this is the first quarter, I think. I know we've been seeing the tightening spreads, but this is the first quarter where CAF income actually lagged in growth relative to revenue. And is there something, as we think about going forward, the impact of those spreads, should that gap widen? It's just we're all retail analysts, so if you could help us think about the finance income component of the equation going forward with the tightening spreads. Thomas W. Reedy: Sure. I'll give it a shot, Sharon. As far as how high it can go, that's really going to depend on the applicant flow we see coming in the stores and applying for credit. With our current buy box and testing we're doing now, we're very comfortable with the spectrum of credit we're buying. We're not actively pushing super hard to go further downstream. But I would point you back to years past where we had a partner in the Tier 1 or the prime space with BofA when we saw higher than 42% in penetration in Tier 1. So it's really a matter of what the mix is coming through the door as what we can achieve on that front. As far as the tightening of spreads, it's something we've been talking about for a number of quarters. And as we've talked about, it takes a couple of years for the impact of any change in our profitability or behavior to kind of work itself through the system. And so I think it's not a surprise to us that the income growth is lagging, the revenue growth from CAF. In fact, I think we were expecting that as the spreads have tightened. And I would just encourage you to look at what we're originating and you can look at the public deals that are out there, you can see the exact spreads that's in every deal that's out in the public market. You can see what we're originating every quarter with the metrics that we're giving you and get a feel for what the portfolio is doing, and look at it over time and see what will -- what should happen. Operator : And your next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : I've got a couple of questions I'm going to kind of lump into one. But first off, maybe just an update on kind of where your thinking is at the SG&A leverage point now. Because in the quarter, we saw the sales obviously accelerated very nicely, SG&A spending picked up as well. So maybe as you look at -- if we at the balance for this year, kind of where that leverage point is? And then second part of the question kind of goes back to our prior question, but as we think about the 17% used unit comp here, you called out your conversion is improving, but you also mentioned, I think, in the press release about maybe a benefit from the delayed tax refund. So the question out there is how should we think about the near-term sustainability of that 17% comp, particularly with comparisons getting maybe a little more challenging here over the next couple of quarters? Thomas J. Folliard: What was the first part again? Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Leverage point in SG&A. Thomas J. Folliard: Leverage. We haven't thought differently -- we don't think any different about leverage than we did before. We have aways said that we needed, in a growth mode, mid to high single-digit comps in order to achieve leverage. Obviously, 17% comps is going to provide some pretty good leverage. So our thoughts on leverage aren't really much different than they have been in the past. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. I guess one thing to point out though, if you look at the growth in SG&A year-over-year or even this quarter versus last, I think we're seeing a similar amount of dollar spend on new stores and growth than we were last year. And in years past and when we started growing, we were on accelerating plane. So we're at a point today where we're looking back over quarters where we're -- since we're opening a more consistent amount of stores, we're looking it back at kind of less incremental inefficiency seen in years past, so the more similar amount of inefficiency due to the growth. Thomas J. Folliard: And then just as far as the quarter and impacts from tax returns moving, if you look at the 2 quarters combined, we don't really think it had any impact on our sales, so there's a little bit of shift from first quarter to second. It's really hard to say what's sustainability of comps. What you mentioned is a very good point, which is this quarter had a pretty easy comparison, the back half of the year has much more difficult comparison. So we never really to wrapped up on one quarter comps. We try to look at it over a much longer period of time. So obviously, the back half of the year has much more difficult comparisons. But where we're obviously very pleased with how the quarter came out, again, our stores did a terrific job of executing and we had a pretty good comp number. Operator : And your next question is from Simeon Gutman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Also, a multi-part question. The comp back on the comps, I mean, the growth was superb and we've talked about it a little already about some of the drivers. Can you try to shed some maybe more detail, better credits? I think you said, Tom, that the cars 5 years and older or above 25, but how are they changing beneath that if there are any changes? I think you said better training. And then just part of all that question, I don't think the industry is growing quite as fast as what you put up this quarter. Do you think that there's some brand effect here, the brand is more recognized, that the proposition is just better understood by the market, so the market share gains should accelerate going forward? Thomas J. Folliard: Well, we don't want to freak out over one quarter. So I mean, we had a great quarter of growth, but it's just one quarter. Again, we're very happy with it, but I wouldn't look at this and say well now we're going to grow 20% every quarter going forward. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then within the credits here -- I mean, within the age of vehicles with the 5... Thomas J. Folliard: The age of vehicles, we really didn't see much change. We -- our mix this quarter was very similar to last quarter. There really isn't anything you can look at in this quarter and point to one variable and say, \"Oh, there's the big difference and that's why comps accelerated.\" I think it's a result of continued and long hard work by our store teams to continue to get better at what they do everyday and it's really just starting to pay off. There's no silver bullet in the quarter to say this variable changed dramatically and therefore, we've got an extra x amount of comps. I think it's just a continuation of a great consumer offer. And you mentioned our brand. I do think our brand is getting stronger, but I don't think it's like we flipped the switch on brand awareness in the quarter either. I think, again, that's a very long-term build that we've been working on for 20 years. Operator : And your next question is from Aram Rubinson from Nomura. Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Two quick ones, if possible. One, wondering if you can give us what percent of originations you wrote, kind of at APRs, kind of net sub-3, just trying to get a sense of where you are on that financing equation. And then also just on a waterfall basis for conversion rates, are there things that you can kind of look at from traffic to test drive to trade to credit app and approval of where that waterfall is developing? Thomas W. Reedy: Sure, I'll talk about the waterfalls. Well, I mean, we look at traffic coming through the door. Obviously, we improve because of conversion not because of the traffic. But we're seeing our associates in the stores do a better job of engaging the customers. We're seeing more test drives per customer. We're seeing more credit apps for customer and we're seeing, as we talked about on the finance, better conversion of those credit apps, both in the CAF space and in the Tier 3 space. And that's partly due to what's going on in the stores because you can't discount how difficult it might be to get a Tier 3 customer done and to accept that offer, to do so more difficult sales, but also because of the attractiveness of the offers that both they are providing and the CAF has been providing relative to past years. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. And Aram, it's not something you -- again, it's the same thing you can't point your finger at one thing and say that's what did it. But I think another factor that we haven't discussed yet is our web traffic was up 28% year-over-year. And I think obviously, consumer behavior has been shifting and changing over the years, and people are doing more and more research before they come to the store. They're more prepared when we get -- when they get there. So I think our carmax.com is a terrific website with a great search engine and great pictures and a great way for the customer to educate themself on the brand and what we have to offer and the quality of our cars. And then when they show up at the stores, they're getting a terrific consumer experience. So I think customers -- again, it's just a belief, but I think customers that show up at the store are more prepared and maybe more likely to buy than they have been in the past because our brand is stronger, our website is very strong and people are doing a lot more research before they get there. And then, you top that with 9 out of every 10 customers who applied for credit are getting an approval of some kind from one of our -- from at least one of our lenders, and it just gives our associates a lot to work with, so I think it's a number of different things. Operator : And your next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : My primary question relates to credit. So APR is -- have obviously been coming down both for you and across the market for your competition. And that's been extremely reasonable as cost of funds has been kind of historically low. If you think about your perspective on the history of your credit business, looking at 18 to 24 months, in periods when cost of funds stops coming down or maybe it starts to drift up a little bit, what kind of flexibility does the industry have or does -- or what kind of prerogative does the industry take to drive those APRs higher? Does that happen or does it the world just essentially tolerate a lower spread? Thomas W. Reedy: I think we'll know when we see it. I can't be predictive about it. But I think in the past, what we have seen is in time periods when rates are dropping, the customer rates had been sticky and not dropped as fast and vice versa. If rates were going up, that the market has been hesitant. Depending on competition and other things going on, it's going to hard to chase them upwards. So if we see rates increasing, you'd expect some additional compression until the market adjusts. How fast the market adjusts and to what extent, it's going to be dependent on factors at that point in time. We've been fortunate recently, but in the past couple of quarters, we've seen a movement in our ability to convert customers by providing more attractive rates, and that equation is good for CarMax. So we're going to constantly be testing that. We're going to make sure that we have a competitive offer for our customers at CAF because we're the only person in this space, and we don't want to sour people on CarMax because of credit. And we'll just continually try to make sure that we're competitive in providing best offers we can. Thomas J. Folliard: And remember, our consumer offer is unique in that the customer gets like an unfiltered view of the credit offering from the lenders that we provide, so we're really just going to move along with the competition. But I think as a consumer, it's a great environment to fill out a credit application, have it looked up by several lenders and they all operate in a competitive environment. And we have to move along with our -- along with the competition. So when you ask what's going to happen when the cost of funds go up, it's going to be largely dependent on what everybody else does. And we want to sell as many cars as possible and give the consumer the absolute best chance to buy a car from us, and that's always going to be our goal. Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : I guess, if there's a direct follow-up, it's what happened last time as best you recall. I mean, we're trying to look at this on our own, but if you think -- I don't know how many years ago it was when you could think of similar situation where maybe [indiscernible] Thomas J. Folliard: I'll just tell you, Matt, in general, in a rising cost of fund environment, in general, spreads tend to shrink. And in a lowering cost of fund environment, spends tend to widen. I mean, over 20 years, that's what we've seen. If cost of funds go up, we see a little -- we see it shrink a little because rates don't raise as -- go up as fast as cost of funds and it's exactly the opposite on the way down. So that's what we've seen in the past, but we're not making any prediction about what we'll see going forward. Operator : And your next question is from James Albertine from Stifel, Nicolaus. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : If I could ask a quick question on the inventory side and supplies side of the equation here, I noticed the cash build from the fourth quarter into the first quarter and understanding your comments in prior quarters that there were some opportunities to sort of buy ahead of demand as it were. But I just wanted to get your sort of update on where you think the supply is shaking out from a pricing perspective, as well as a forward look, if you will, on a gross profit per unit and how much you can hold in a sort of declining wholesale price environment. Thomas J. Folliard: Well, I can only point to our history on that and we've done a pretty good job of managing through both appreciating and depreciating environment as far as keeping our margins stable. Hopefully, we will be able to do that going forward. The first quarter -- I mean, the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, was really a little bit unique and we talked about it some at the end of the last call because the change in inventory year-over-year was driven by some conservatives in the year prior, and then a little bit more aggression in the fourth quarter. But since then, we've been running our inventory levels kind of in line with our sales and where we want to be. So we're pretty comfortable where our inventory is. We're obviously pretty comfortable with pricing as we were able to maintain our margins during the quarter. And the depreciation that we're seeing now in the marketplace, I don't want to say normal because I'm not sure what that means anymore, but it's a little more normal kind of from what we saw, say from '02 to '08 prior to the recession. We always see cars appreciate a little bit in the beginning of the year and then tend to decline, heading towards the end of the year -- end of the calendar year. So I think as supply starts to come back and we see a little bit more of a normal turn, we'll be in an environment that is actually a little smoother than what we've seen in the past. We've seen some massive volatility in both depreciation and appreciation, and we've done a pretty good job of managing through that. So if it's a little smoother, hopefully, it will be easier for us to manage through. Operator : And your next question is from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It's Dan Galves for Ron. Just had a question on -- a little bit more detail on the really strong comps in the quarter. Now that you have 5 stores that opened in fiscal '12 that are part of the comp, can you give us a sense of how those are performing, where the same comps for those stores better than the overall? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. We don't -- we won't break it out in that much detail, Dan. But what I would tell you is that since we've restarted growth, if you look at the collection of stores we've opened in the aggregate, they're all performing at or above our expectations. So we're very happy with the stores that we've been both building and opening since coming out of the recession, but we don't break it out in that level of detail. Once they become comp, they're into the total average. And as we've talked about before with our model, we expect bigger comps in the early years of a new store, particularly in a new market. It's a little bit of a different equation when you look at adding a satellite store. But if you open up a brand-new store, we're clearly going to expect bigger comps in the first few years as the store gets going. Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And I just want to clarify that you're basically saying that store traffic was essentially flat year-over-year. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. Operator : And your next question is from Rick Nelson from Stephens. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I just want to ask you about subprime at 21% of sales compared to 16% a year ago. How did the delays in the tax refunds effect that and how much opportunity to grow subprime do you see and how much less profitable is? And I think in the past, you've said about $1,000 per unit. Thomas W. Reedy: I'll take those in order. As far as the shift over year, I think it was pretty minimal. It was a small part of the increase, but it was definitely not as what we saw. Subprime sales carry into the first quarter a little more strongly than we would have expected. As far as how high subprime can go, that is really going to be dependent on behavior of our partners and they're lending behavior and the traffic through the door and the quality of credit with our applicants. We don't influence or dictate how our lending partners are going to approve people or the types of offers they're going to give, so we're dependent on them on a go-forward basis. We've been very happy with the relationships. And I think how high it can go, it depends -- it really just -- it just depends. As far as the profitability, nothing's changed. It's about a $1,000 discount to where we see a traditional transaction. Thomas J. Folliard: But just as a reminder, Rick, as we've talked about before, at that moment, that customer has been -- has no other alternative for credit, so all of our other lenders have decided not to offer them a loan. So at that moment, that customer for us, we believe, is pretty much 100% incremental. So although the profit might be lower, it's profit that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Additionally, I think we're the best place to buy a car for a credit customer in that category because we don't change our prices based on the fact that there might potentially be a higher repo rate. We deliver an exceptionally high-quality car. We do it in a transparent fashion. And for us, not -- everybody's credit changes over time and those customers become CarMax spokespeople. So we're very proud of the offering that we have and we're happy to provide credit offerings for all spectrums of credit from -- in all different tiers for our customers. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Is it fair enough for [indiscernible] -- maybe to bring those kind of some of that subprime business fund to your own books? Thomas W. Reedy: I think we're happy with the spectrum of credit we're buying today and -- but it's -- to the extent that becomes something that is an opportunity, we'll let you know. We're always looking at what we should be doing different in the business to the extent there is -- are things we should be doing. Operator : And your next question is from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : To what extent do you think -- when we look at the Manheim index, about 5% lower than a year ago, to what extent do you think lower used car prices may be improving the value proposition that you guys are able to offer to customers and maybe improving your competitive position and perhaps contributing to that conversion rate? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, that's a really hard thing to gauge. If you look at our average retail, it's actually not down. So again, we're always kind of buying at the higher end of the used car spectrum, and 5% is not that big a move, particularly in the period of time we're talking about. So I would say, at this point, very little impact, if any. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question is from David Whiston from Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : A consumer behavior question for you. There's been some talk on the new vehicle production side of -- eventually the supply chain not being able to keep up with the growth in U.S. demand. So if that were to happen and there were some bottlenecks that were consumers who want to buy new can't, would you expect those consumers to go to a CarMax store to buy used or do you think they would just stay out of the market? Thomas J. Folliard: That's really impossible to tell, but if you look at the growth in the SAR, it has actually decelerated, so I think the last -- so the last quarter was up 5%, and we've seen double-digit growth there in the last couple of years. So we're not looking at -- it doesn't look to us like new car sales are going so fast that manufacturers can't keep up with it. Operator : And your next question is from -- a follow-up from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It was great to hear about the increased penetration of mobile. Can you talk at all about whether you're seeing higher conversions from customers who were engaged in mobile and sort of your ability to track the impact that, that might be having on your business? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. We really can't. I mean, we can only track it. It depends how much information they give us. Any lead we get, whether it's just regular carmax.com or from a tablet or from a mobile, customers can go and search and do all kinds of stuff without giving us any information. If it translates into a lead where they call the store, they email the store, then it's a little bit more trackable. But I don't know exactly, but I don't think we've really seen a discernible difference between a mobile hit to the website or a regular hit to the website. I just think in general, consumers are going to -- I think obviously that what a touchscreen of some kind, whether it's a tablet or mobile, is continue -- is going to continue to be a bigger percentage of total hits to our website. So we have to make sure we have a great experience for the customer and a great offering for them, and we're very focused on that. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. Thomas J. Folliard: Okay. With no further questions, I want to thank all of you for joining. And I, of course, want to thank all of our associates for all they do everyday, and we'll see you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 FY '14 conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Katharine Kenny, you may begin your conference. Katharine W. Kenny: Thank you, Susan, and good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. As usual, on the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended February 28, 2013, filed with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] Thanks so much. Tom? Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you saw, used unit comps for the second quarter grew 16% compared to last year, primarily due to better conversion, as well as a modest increase in traffic. Total used unit sales grew by 21% in the quarter. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 21%, and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,174 was virtually the same as last year. Also, unit sales increased by 10%. This was largely due to a higher buy rates and the growth in our store base. Total wholesale vehicle gross profit increased by 3%, as the 10% growth in units was partially offset by a decrease of $58 in gross profit per unit. Extended service plan revenues rose 23%, reflecting our sales growth and an increase in penetration. CAF quarterly income increased 12% to $84 million. Tom will give you some details on that in a moment. Overall, we had a very strong quarter. Net earnings grew 26% to $140 million and net earnings per diluted share rose 29% to $0.62 a share. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about financing. Thomas W. Reedy: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the second quarter, CAF income was up 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, while our average managed receivables increased 24% to $6.5 billion. Consistent with recent experience, the portfolio growth was driven by a continuing strong origination volume, which was supported by the expansion in CAF penetration, CarMax's sales growth and an increase in the average amounts financed. Managed receivables continue to grow at a faster pace than CAF earnings, as the increase in loan volume was offset by continued compression in the spread between consumer rates and funding costs. Credit losses in the quarter were largely in line with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses grew to $66 million or approximately 1% of ending managed receivables, compared to 0.9% in Q2 of FY '13. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 32% to $1.1 billion, and net penetration was 41% compared to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The weighted average contract rate for the quarter's originations was 6.8% compared to 8.1% in last year's second quarter, but that's down only slightly from 7.0% in this year's first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, we experienced higher applicant flow, higher conversion, arising from both more attractive offers and better in-store execution and also greater retention of our finance customers, as 3-day payouts remain at historical lows. We believe our finance offers continue to optimize overall sales and profits for CarMax. And as outlined in the press release, we saw third-party subprime providers accounting for about 18% of our sales in the second quarter, compared to 15% in last year's second quarter. Now I'll turn it back over to Tom. Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you. Regarding our sales mix, there was very little change. Sales of 5 year and older vehicles were above 25% as a percentage of our total as they have been for the last few years. Sales of SUVs and trucks remained about 25% as well, similar to last year, although sales of compacts and midsized vehicles grew a few percentage points to nearly 40%. As we've discussed in the past, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand. Total SG&A increased by 11%, reflecting variable expenses related to higher sales and the 12% growth in our store base since the beginning of last year's second quarter. SG&A per retail unit fell by $174, largely driven by our 16% comps. In the second quarter, our average monthly web visits grew to over 12 million for the first time, up more than 30% compared to last year's second quarter and up from 11.5 million in the first quarter. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represent about 21% of total visits and visits utilizing our iPhone and Android apps grew to approximately 11% of our traffic by quarter end, compared to about 9% at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, we opened 2 new stores : our fifth store in Houston, Texas; and our second store in Sacramento, California. In our press release, we also announced 5 planned superstore openings for next year's second quarter. Four will be in new markets for CarMax, including Madison, Wisconsin; Reno, Nevada; Lynchburg, Virginia; and Portland, Oregon. We will also open our fifth store in the Dallas market. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Tom, one question with maybe 1 or 2 little parts, and I'll say it all upfront. First, regarding the vehicle population, the data is pointing to an inflection point in the 0- to 5-year-old range. Your mix comments alluded to this to some degree, but I'm curious if you can share any anecdotes of whether you're starting to sense or see a change in the complexion of some of the vehicles that are coming through your channel. And then the second part of that question, is the store pipeline, based on the press release, it looks pretty robust over the next 12 months. I think it's 17 stores. And so unless the back half of next year is very light, might you end up doing either the high end or a little bit more than the high end of the range of store growth? Thomas J. Folliard: So although that was a two-part question, they were 2 very different questions. However, we're going to allow it. But as far as the mix is concerned, we really haven't seen much of a change. If you look at what's happened with new cars than supply, it does feel like we're heading towards an inflection point. But in terms of if you just divide our inventory into 2 big segments : 0 to 4 and 5 to 10, there was very little change in our mix between those 2 segments. As I said last quarter, we saw some movement within 0 to 4, but not as a group. So that was very similar this quarter. In terms of the store mix, we've not changed to what our plans are of 10 to 15 stores. Including this year, we said for the next 3 years. So that's this year and the following 2. What you see in the next 12 months is just a reflection of timing, so it really hasn't changed at all. It's just -- and it will be kind of a higher volume over the next 12 months than the 12-month periods around it -- we haven't changed our projections at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So I'm just wondering if the mixed compacts and midsized vehicles impacted the gross profit per unit. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about what led to the improved conversion? I'm sure it was lots of little things but maybe just the highlights. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. As we said before, Matt, the mix of vehicles by category really doesn't have much impact on our margins. And our margins were flat and it was only a few points of move within that segment anyway, so very little impact there. And what was the second part? Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just factors that led to a better conversion? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, it's pretty much the same. As we talked about last quarter, we have outstanding execution in our stores. We have some good results coming from improved training programs, but, also, we have better consumer offers from our, not only CAF, but our lending partners as well. So they have a little bit more to work with. We have approvals at all-time highs, which has not really changed from last quarter of kind of our global approval rate of all applications that we receive in the store. 90% of applicants are receiving an approval from at least one of those lenders. So it's very similar to last quarter. I think just great execution in the stores, very good offers and our store teams have done a really nice job of getting inventory and getting it ready and getting it up to a very high quality standard, so our customers have a very great selection. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : The question I had was really, maybe a couple of parts under the 1 topic, at the subprime. So we're seeing the results there that the subprime remains a contributor to your overall sales growth. The question I have with respect to subprime, I mean, one, as we look at this, maybe from a high-level perspective, are you managing that growth? Or are you just allowing the market to basically dictate it for you? And as you're thinking -- as you think about this growth, kind of, where's your mind as far as the puts and takes, maybe the risks, the benefit-risk relationship at subprime becomes -- continues to become a bigger piece? And then finally, just as we've started to see interest rates rise a little bit here, is there any shift in the way your subprime providers are financing customers? Thomas J. Folliard: In terms of the mix, it's really -- it's actually as a percentage of sales, it's slightly down from last quarter in terms of how we think about that business. We're not controlling that at all. Those -- the lenders that are approving those customers are only seeing those applications after they've been declined by CAF and all of our other lending partners. So as I've said in the past, our view is, at that moment, that is a 100% incremental sale. It's a sale that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise to that consumer did not have an option for credit. So although it's a lower profit deal for us at that moment, we believe it's 100% incremental. And what's been happening over the last few years, as we've said a number of times, it's just our lending partners, again, more and more comfortable with our origination channel. I think they've been more aggressive with their offers to our applicants, and it's been terrific for sales. Each individual deal at the moment that it's approved, we think it's a good decision for us. So we really haven't -- we're not at a level that we're uncomfortable with. And as I said, if you compare it to the first quarter, actually down slightly in this quarter. I don't know if Tom can comment some on the interest rate part. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. As far as the rate environment up, during the quarter, we didn't see any change in our subprime partners' behavior, vis-\u00e0-vis what they were doing in the Q1 or across the quarter. But obviously, if we see significant changes in the interest rates, just like with CarMax Auto Finance, it impacts the overall math of their -- the makeup of their returns, so we would expect them to change behavior in some way. How that would be, we can't tell you until it starts to happen. But at this point, we have no reason to think that they are in the mode of change in their buy behavior. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Your SG&A per unit declined nicely, providing some very good operating leverage. What were the key factors behind that? Thomas J. Folliard: About 16% comps, similar to last quarter. We've always said that in a growth mode, which we're in, we need, we think, mid- to high-single-digit comps in order to begin to get some leverage. So when -- if we're going to be in the mid to high teens, we would expect some leverage. So it's also very good execution. You still have to remain very disciplined in the stores with managing your expenses. And, I think, once again, our store teams did an outstanding job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : My question also relates to CAF. We are seeing the APR, I guess, the average APR you're offering your consumers through CAF continue to come down, though to your point the decline from Q1 was relatively modest. Now that we're starting to see your financing cost firm up, along with the overall cost of money, what's your feel within the market, both for your and your competitors' desire to start to lift that APR? And what are consumers' tolerance, you think, to entertain somewhat higher cost to money on the credit front? Thomas W. Reedy: Matt, that as far as consumers' tolerance and our competitors' desire, we're going to have to just keep an eye on that and, through testing and watching our 3-day payoffs and watching what the competitive marketplace is offering, work through that. As far as the funding costs, we've seen them tick up a bit. I still feel like the ABS market is open to it, and we're doing a good job with securitizing. We've done 3 deals this year. We did see spreads tick up a little bit last deal, but not dramatically. As far as benchmarks go, that's why we hedge, as we originate our loans and that's why we have CAF, is looking at the market every week and making their pricing decision. So, I mean, I guess, I can just emphasize it. Our plan is to run a competitive and profitable finance business with an overall eye towards maximizing CarMax's profits and sales. So we can't -- because we're the only person in the Tier 1 space, we can't afford to turn customers off the CarMax at the finance office, so we're always going to make sure that we're competitive. I think we're in a nice position because we are -- we can contest very pretty accurately, because we control our origination channel. And I think that gives us a competitive advantage and ability to stay on top of the market. Thomas J. Folliard: [indiscernible] dramatically is the transparency of our offer to the consumer is, I think, a critical and very important competitive differentiator for us. And since customers -- since we don't negotiate, there are no incentives in our stores for financing. The customer gets a real clear picture of exactly what their rate is. And if they don't -- if they think they can get better rates, they have 3 days to go pay it off somewhere else. So it's an excellent barometer for us to make sure that we're charging a very competitive rate. But in some regards, we're going to only be able to move as much as the market allows. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Do you think that the market is starting to move at this point? Thomas J. Folliard: Well, it hasn't shown up in our rates yet. So -- but this is -- a lot of times, rates are in a longer cycle. We've seen in the past, as rates have gone up, that the market doesn't move up as much and you tend to see some compression. This is no different than normal. And when rates -- when cost of funds goes down, oftentimes, the lenders don't go down as quickly, and you tend to see a little widening of the spread. So if you look back over the years for us, this is kind of normal. When rates go up, you see a little compression. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : This is Elizabeth Suzuki on for John. On store openings, what percentage of the U.S. markets will you be ultimately able to service with your current growth plan? I think the number was somewhere around 50% a little while ago. Just wanted to get an idea of what the target is for the next couple of years. Thomas J. Folliard: I haven't really thought of it like that. We're only in half of U.S. markets. When we think about a 3-year growth plan of 10 to 15 stores a year, we said roughly half of those stores will be in building back into existing markets. So I haven't really thought of it that way. What we're more thinking about is our long-term growth plan, and how to make the CarMax consumer offer available to customers all over the country. So our goal is to go everywhere. I don't really know what percentage we'll achieve in the stated growth plan of 3 years, which -- of which we're in year 1. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. But there's still plenty of room for growth, obviously? Thomas J. Folliard: Plenty of room for growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel, Nicolaus. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to focus very quickly, if I could, on originations. I think last quarter, you gave some good details around sort of your online metrics and some of your app metrics. And I just noticed, looking at your SG&A in a little bit more detail, obviously, advertising sounds significantly year-over-year. So maybe they're related, maybe they're not related, but I was hoping you could kind of walk us through that. And perhaps, just from a housekeeping standpoint, talk about the buy rate from the appraisal lane. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, I'm not sure what you're referring to there on the app rate. Advertising was down in the quarter. Some of that's driven by a higher comp rate. Some of that is timing, some of that as you expect to get a little leverage on advertising as you continue to grow. In terms of the -- what was the last part? Oh, the buy rate, yes, in terms of the buy rate, it was up for the quarter, compared to last year's second quarter. So that helps contribute to that 10% growth in wholesale. And we've always talked about that being a balancing act between buying cars through the appraisal lane, does some of those customers, in turn, buy a retail car from us, and you really can't manage one individually. So we're actually very, very pleased with how the -- how it all came out in total. Nice buy rate increase in, really, what was a depreciating environment, which is a little bit more normal. So if you look at the Manheim index for the summer, we saw some depreciation, which we would normally expect. That we've had a few years where things haven't been the way they normally are. But -- so to see our buy rate tick up a little for the quarter, we are very pleased with that. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And any update on the online front in terms of any of the metrics that you're willing to share? Thomas J. Folliard: Well, I talked about them earlier, mostly just on hits. 12 million hits to the website, average monthly visits, that's an all-time high. We obviously continue to see growth through mobile applications, and touchpads, actually, at the end of the quarter, it was the first time for CarMax that more than 50% of all of the hits to the website came from something other than a desktop. So that's a trend that we expect to continue. We don't do a lot of online credit applications. I'm not sure if that's the question you were asking earlier, but that's a very tiny piece of our total at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Tom, so your average selling price actually declined slightly year-over-year for first time since, I think, 2009. Does that reflect mix? Or are we seeing some impact from lower acquisition cost? Or is it just not big enough of a decrease to even be relevant? Thomas J. Folliard: It's that part, what you just said. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : The last part? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, it's not really a relevant number. I would guess it's partly the first 2 things : a little bit of mix, a little bit of some depreciation in the quarter, but nothing that we're really spending time thinking about. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : So it sounds like your acquisition costs that are not necessarily following along with the Manheim index, which, obviously, has been decreasing. Thomas J. Folliard: It's impossible to tell from the ASP, because of all the variation in the mix. I think the easiest way to look at it is our margins were relatively flat to last year. So we have to be tracking somewhat close to the market on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis in order to achieve a flat margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about if you would want to own the new properties you're constructing? Would you want to own them if interest rates were to rise dramatically? And what's your goal for owning your real estate in terms of the percentage over the midterm? Thomas W. Reedy: We really don't look at it as a goal, whether we want to own it or lease it or controlled portfolio. We look at it as the amount of capital we need to commit to execute our opening plan and our Treasury department's going to look and figure out the best way to fund it from a cost and flexibility perspective, depending on what the market offers at the time that we need the capital. At this time point, we haven't had to use any external capital to buy our sites. But if you ask me, all else equal, I'd prefer to own rather than lease our real estate, because it allows you to be the master of your own destiny a lot more. Thomas J. Folliard: The only thing I'd add there is, we want to get the best site. So there are some cases where maybe the only thing available is a long-term ground lease. And if it's the best site, then we'll look at the cost and we'll make a decision based on that. David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So are interest rates a major decision factor for your Treasury department? Thomas J. Folliard: What's that? Thomas W. Reedy: I'm not sure what you're getting at. David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : You said the Treasury department is evaluating for -- on each deal, so just, from your answer, it just sounded like interest rates were not that high on the decision-making tree for your Treasury department. I just wanted to confirm that. Thomas W. Reedy: We look at everything from an overall need-for-capital perspective. So our business generates a certain amount of money. We need a certain amount of liquidity for inventory and working capital, and we need capital to fund our growth. The last couple of years, we have not needed to go external for that capital as we look forward, to the extent we would need to go external for that capital. But what I was saying is, whether we're leasing or buying the property, is not a fact -- is a factor, but it's not -- the decision point's not based on a preference to own versus lease. It's based on a preference to get the best cost of fund and most flexibility. Thomas J. Folliard: And remember, too, oftentimes, we'll make a decision on moving forward with a certain piece of property and then we won't actually have to fund it for 2 or 3 years. So we're not going to make a decision now, not knowing what the circumstances will be 2 or 3 years from now. So then Tom and his team will make whatever the best decision is at that time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thomas J. Folliard: All right, seeing no further questions, I want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Thanks for your support and continued interest in CarMax, and thanks to all of our associates, once again, for their dedication and hard work and all they do every day. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 FY 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Katharine Kenny, you may begin your conference. Katharine W. Kenny: Good morning. Happy holidays. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2014 third quarter earnings conference call. I have with me today Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I need to remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind all of you that our next regular Analyst Day takes place on January 21. If you're interested in attending, please let us know. Tom? Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Used unit comps for the third quarter were up 10% compared to last year despite the toughest comparison of the year, primarily due to better conversion, as well as a modest increase in traffic. Total used unit sales grew by 15% in the quarter. Used vehicle gross profit grew by 16%, and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,149 was generally flat compared to last year. Wholesale unit sales, up 4% due to the growth in our store base. Our wholesale gross profit was similar to the prior year, as the 4% growth in units was offset by a decrease of $36 in gross profit per unit. Extended service plan revenues were also similar to the prior year, as the reserve adjustment related to the increases in cancellations offset the effect of our sales growth. CAF quarterly income increased 16% to $84 million. The bottom line is we're pleased with another strong quarter. Net earnings grew 12% to $106.5 million, and net earnings per diluted share rose 15% to $0.47 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to talk about financing. Tom? Thomas W. Reedy: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, CAF income grew 16% compared to the third quarter of FY '13. Average managed receivables increased 24% to $6.8 billion, and portfolio growth continues to be largely driven by strong origination volume. Similar to the first half of the year, managed receivables grew at a faster pace than CAF earnings, as the increase in loan volume was offset by compression in the spread versus last year's third quarter. Weighted average contract rate for accounts originated during the quarter was 7% compared to 7.7% in last year's third quarter, but up slightly from the 6.8% we saw in Q2 of this year. The allowance for loan losses increased to $68 million, and at 1% was flat as a percentage of managed receivables. Credit losses in the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 12% to $961 million, and net penetration was 41% for both this and the prior year's third quarter. Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 18% of our sales in the third quarter compared to 15% in last year's third quarter. As you know, we have experienced an increase in subprime volume over the last couple years, as third-party providers have made more attractive offers to customers. Late in the quarter, we began to see them tighten the credit offers that they've been providing. Finally, we plan to launch a test during the quarter to actively learn more about originating and servicing customers who would typically be financed by our subprime providers, an initiative we've been working on for over a year. Our objective, at this point, is to gain familiarity with the customer segment and to determine if it is appropriate for CAF to participate as one of the lenders in this space. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we plan to route a small percentage of these applications to CAF, and we'd expect to originate approximately $70 million over the course of the next year. This represents less than 2% of what CAF originated from -- in the last 12 months, and we plan to fund this test separately from our securitization vehicles. Tom? Thomas J. Folliard: Thank you. Regarding our sales mix, there were very few changes of note. Similar to the second quarter, sales of compacts and midsized vehicles grew a few percentage points. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand. Total SG&A for the quarter increased by 11%, reflecting the 12% growth in our store base since the beginning of last year's third quarter and variable expenses related to higher sales. SG&A per retail unit was down $98, again, largely driven by the 10% comps. In the third quarter, our average monthly web visits neared 12 million hits per month, up 36% compared to last year's third quarter. This quarter was the first during which more than 50% of our traffic came from devices other than desktops or laptops. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represented about 26% of total visits, and visits utilizing our iPhone or Android app represented nearly 12% of our traffic. Also during the third quarter, we opened 3 stores : 1 in Jackson, Tennessee; 1 in Brandywine, Maryland; and 1 in St. Louis. And after the third quarter ended, we also opened our second store in St. Louis and 2 stores in our Philadelphia market, including our King of Prussia store, which will open today. We announced 4 planned openings for next year's third quarter. Three are in new markets for CarMax, including Portland, Oregon, Tupelo, Mississippi and Reno, Nevada. We will also open our third store in the Raleigh market. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Simeon Gutman. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So I have one and a follow-up. The first might have a couple of parts to it. On the finance side regarding the subprime tightening, can you talk to -- is the number of offers being made is going down or is it the same number with higher rates? And can you discuss what's sparking the change and if you're seeing any other changes in the actions of other lenders? Thomas W. Reedy: I'll take that, Simeon. As far as what tightening means, it really means they're going backward on the changes that they've made over the past couple of years, which is downpayment and kind of ease of documentation. So it seems to slide back a little bit on that. As far as where it lands, we don't know, it's too early to tell and what that means. And as far as why they're doing it, they run their own portfolios, just like CAF does, they're managing to optimize profitability and size as well. I can't speak for them, but I guess -- I would guess that they're taking moves to manage risks based on what they've been seeing over the past couple of years. I do not believe that it's a CarMax-specific issue, though. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then the other lenders at the other part of, I guess, the portfolio, not the non-CAF stuff, some of the other lenders, are you seeing any changes there? Thomas W. Reedy: Actually, this quarter has been a little bit positive vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis where they've been historically. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then the one follow-up is in, in testing your own portfolio, is that something that was discussed with your current partners and might you expect a change in the fee you pay as a result of that test? Thomas W. Reedy: No, this is something that we've made them aware of. In fact, we've been working with them over the past year trying to do due diligence and get smarter about the -- about working in this space, so it's not a surprise for them. And the nice thing about being back in growth mode again is that we can grow the portfolio and allow partners to continue to grow and bring new people in, like ourselves, if that's what makes sense. Operator : And your next question is from Matt Nemer. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I'm just -- just a follow-up on subprime. I'm curious if your in-house auctions and the ability to sort of dispose of vehicles quickly and probably cheaper than other subprime players could potentially allow you to have a better offer in the marketplace. Thomas J. Folliard: Matt, we dispose of a lot of our current repos through our auction channel, so I think it's just another thing that we do that makes it easy for us to run a finance business or easier to run a finance business, because we don't have to rely heavily on outside parties to dispose of repos. So it's a factor, but I don't think it's a big one. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. And, Matt, I'd also point out, we're not -- in the event that we go through this test and we determine it's the right thing to do for us, our goals are not going to be to outcompete other people in the subprime space. We're looking at it as potential profit and risk mitigation in our business. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And then on the warranty business, I'm curious just why the cancel rate has ticked higher. It seems like at $10 a month on a $200 or $300 payment, it's not something that you would really pay a lot of attention to. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes, Matt, we're not going to be able to go into any granularity on what is driving the cancel rate, but we have observed a higher rate of cancellations on the ESP we've originated over recent years. And as a reminder, that product is cancelable anytime during its life, and we have to return a pro rata amount in the event the customer cancels it. They could cancel it at will. They could be canceling it because they're buying a new car, because they got repo-ed, for any number of reasons. So as we sell that product, we book a reserve, and it's an estimate, just like it would be on CAF loan losses, that we have to tune on a periodic basis. If you remember, we had a $0.01 adjustment in the fourth quarter. The portfolio has gotten a lot bigger. We've actually sold over $700 million of the product since 2010. And we've seen the movement, so it's appropriate to adjust the reserve amount here. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess, do you think that's -- should we view that as more of a macro consumer issue? Or is it -- does it have something to do with, you think, with your offer? Thomas W. Reedy: Like I said, we can't go to that kind of granularity. What I would view it as, from your perspective, is a very slight worsening in the profitability of ESP because we have a different view on what's going to be returned on a go-forward basis. And if we see different behavior going forward, we'll change it again. But it amounts to a small adjustment in the go-forward reserve, and a minimal, maybe 1% less profitable on the ESP that we sell. So it's a few dollars a car. Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And then just lastly, the stats on the web visits and the mobile usage are pretty strong. What does that mean for your business model? I mean, are those customers more likely to convert? Are they more likely to refer you to a friend? Have you kind of thought through what that could mean from a financial standpoint, longer-term? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, it's a little hard to say, but I just clearly think this is where consumers are going. And they're spending a lot more time on the web prior to coming to the store, and we've seen that trend for several years. So it's not surprising that the growth of web traffic dramatically exceeds the growth of foot traffic. I think people are showing up more prepared. So I think it has lots of ramifications for the business, but it's really difficult to figure out what that is right now. But in general, I think it's positive. I think we have a great app, and I think we have a great website and a great search engine. And I think we're providing tools that customers want so that they're better prepared to make a decision. Operator : Your next question is from John Murray (sic) [Murphy]. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's John Murphy. Just a follow-up on the CAF question here on the subprime side. What is the motivating factor there? Is that really just to grow CAF earnings, which is a good thing, or is that a response to this pullback in credit availability you're seeing from your subprime partners? And also, what was the highest that subprime was as a percentage of sales at the peak? Thomas W. Reedy: Yes, John. As I mentioned, we've worked on this for over a year, so it's not a reactionary move at all. Customers with challenged credit have become a meaningful part of our overall business, and they're a meaningful part of the used car market, so we feel like we owe it to ourselves to get smarter about this space. Whether we're in it or not with our partners, we need to understand it a little better. We considered a number of options, including a joint venture or something like that, but we determined this is the best way to learn. So I hope -- that's probably the best way to address [indiscernible]. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, I mean, John, when this was 3% or 4% of our business, it wasn't as big of a discussion point. But when it's 15% plus, we have to look at what's in the overall best interest of the company. So this is just a step in that direction to really learn more about the segment. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It seems like it makes a lot of sense. But what was the peak percentage, is it 18% kind of...? Thomas J. Folliard: 21%. Katharine W. Kenny: It's 21%. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : 21%, okay, great. Then just a second question on vehicle pricing, up $125. Tom, was that just -- is that just a function of mix? Because there's always this expectation -- or there's this expectation in the market that used vehicle pricing might come down, but that doesn't seem to be happening at all. Thomas J. Folliard: John, I missed the beginning part of that. What did you say, used vehicle pricing? Thomas W. Reedy: Up $125. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Your revenue per unit was up $125 year-over-year, and it's a pretty strong number. I'm just curious what you're seeing for used vehicle pricing. Is that mix or -- I mean, there's an expectation that used vehicle pricing will come down, and that's just not happening. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, I've never seen it come down other than in the recession, when it dropped a couple thousand dollars in less than 6 months. So I mean, we don't view $100 as a very big number on an over $19,000 average retail, so we didn't really spend any time looking or talking about that. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, bench of general managers for new stores, where are you at on that process? Thomas J. Folliard: We feel like we're in really good shape. Our opening plan, as we've announced, 10 to 15 stores over the next 3 years. This is the first of those 3. As a percentage of the base of stores that we have, it's actually a smaller percentage than what we've grown in the past. And I think we've done a really nice job over the last few years of building up our pipeline, both in terms of real estate availability, people availability, getting folks trained and ready to go and having people prepped to move to new markets. So I feel like we're in really good shape. Operator : And your next question is from Matt Fassler. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'd like to dig a little bit deeper into subprime as well, and just get a better understanding from you as to sort of the operational differences in managing a subprime business from running CAF as it exists today. And also, if you could give us some sense as to the sources of funding as you launch your pilot? And then, if it's successful, whether you would anticipate funding subprime through the ABS market or through some other vehicle. Thomas W. Reedy: Sure, Matt. So I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about what we're doing as far as managing services. But our game plan is to randomly route a small percentage of customers to CAF and run them through the scoring model that we've developed and provide great customer-friendly service. One thing I think is important to remember, we've got a great team in Atlanta that runs a great finance business, and we already serve a pretty wide spectrum of credit. Some customers need more attention than the others as far as calls, et cetera. We're viewing this as an expansion, really, of what we already do. And like I said, without getting into details, we've built upon our account servicing techniques, and I think it will be appropriate -- it will be helpful for this space. But I think we'll also learn some things and have some benefit in the business we do today from it. As far as funding, at this point, we're just going to use cash on hand to fund the test, it's very small. To the extent we decide to go forward with this as a line of business or an initiative, we'll explore other options, and we would plan on trying to do something, to the extent it's available. Whether it's in the ABS market, conduits, that will be -- we'll determine that as we see fit. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then just a quick follow-up, this just goes back to core used vehicle sales. Obviously, the supply of newer vehicles coming off lease seems to be starting to gush, and it's plentiful relative to where it had been in recent years. Are you seeing that flow through to your buying opportunities? What's your sense of whether that's actually materializing the way the numbers say it is and what that does for your sourcing and volume potential going forward? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, it's -- I think the gush you're talking about in leasing is leased percentage of new cars sold, and that's really a lot more recent. So those cars, really, have not started coming back in any big numbers. So as we've talked about last quarter, that our mix shift between 0- to 4-year-old and 5- to 10-year-old really hasn't moved very much. But clearly, if the SAAR stays -- continues to move up in the 16 million plus range and the percentage of leased vehicles is higher, then, ultimately, those cars will come back at the auction. It really hasn't started to happen yet, but we expect it to, and I think that's good for us. Operator : Your next question is from Sharon Zackfia. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : So a couple of questions on CarMax Auto Finance, and then I had a question for Tom as well. So on the tightening of credit, it didn't look like, based on the percent of subprime sales in the quarter, that it had any kind of noticeable impact. So has it been more of an impact as you've gone into the fourth quarter, or was it near the very end of the third quarter? Thomas W. Reedy: Yes, I think, as we mentioned in the release, late in the quarter we saw a change of behavior. And every call, last 3 -- 2 or 3 calls, I've been asked whether we see any reason to think that our partners' behavior may be different than it has been. And this time, we do. So that's why we're talking about it. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And I mean, are the loans you're going to generate through CAF, are they expected to be a substitutive of the loans that you would have generated through the third-party lenders, so kind of cannibalizing the third-party? Or is it a significantly different scorecard than your third-party lenders use, so it would be additive, if I'm making sense there? Thomas W. Reedy: It's our own scorecard, but we plan on routing to CAF just like we route to our other third-party lenders. So it would eat a little bit into what they're doing. Thomas J. Folliard: We're not going into this, Sharon, thinking we're going to add a bunch of incremental sales because our third-party providers are missing the boat in this arena. This just becomes such a big percentage, we don't want to have kind of so little visibility into this area, particularly one that's so costly for us. Thomas W. Reedy: Right. It's important to remember that these sales through these partners are about 1/3 as profitable as something that goes through the -- either the CAF or one of our other channels. So there's a big economic [indiscernible] there between... Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, there's quite a lot of incentive there. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And I assume, if this is a good pilot program and you expand it further sometime in the future, you wouldn't indefinitely fund this through your own balance sheet, right? Thomas W. Reedy: No. As I said to Matt, I think we'd look at alternatives to fund this. And as I also mentioned, we're looking at this as a play for profit, potentially, and risk mitigation. And at this point, if this test makes sense, we'd envision us being one of several partners in that space, not trying to grab all of the share. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then just a quick question on marketing. I mean the year-to-date marketing spend is pretty flat, which, I think, is relatively unusual. And I was hoping somebody could speak to whether that's just more efficiencies you're getting in the marketing team or in the buys that you have, if your impressions are actually up year-over-year or if those are flattish? Just any indication of what's going on with marketing because I'm just surprised that it's not up more. Thomas J. Folliard: Well, we have pretty good comps for the first 9 months of the year. So that, hopefully, is going to drive some leverage. And we do have some timing. We'll spend a little more on the second half of the year. We are planning along running a Super Bowl ad this year. That's -- it's a few million dollars. It's not dramatic, but it's -- there will be a little bit of timing into the fourth quarter. But we expect the business to leverage in a number of different areas. And if we're running -- we were 16, 17 and 10 in comps for the first 3 quarters, so... Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : It was actually flat in dollars, though. I mean, I was just looking at it in dollars, not as a percentage of sales. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, and we think of it as dollars per car sold. So that's -- when I say leverage, I'm talking about in dollars per car sold. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. You're going to force me to watch the Super Bowl, that's the master plan. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : So I, too, want to ask a question about subprime. If -- what can you -- is there any way to quantify the impact to your -- upon your sales of these actions the lenders have taken here recently? I mean, in other words, how should we think about how much that is, either in the current quarter or going forward? How much could this weigh upon your used car sales? Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. I mean, we aren't very good at predicting the future for any part of our business, which is why we don't give guidance. And I think it's just too early to tell. We don't know where they're going to land as far as where they dial in at how much they're going to tighten, so we can't give any guidance going forward. But we -- like I said, it is a -- we have observed a change. We get asked this question every quarter, and we thought it was important to let you know. Thomas J. Folliard: And there's way too many other variables. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. Thomas J. Folliard: When you think like the question Matt asked about supply and customer traffic and the growth in our web traffic. There's just a lot of things, a lot of moving parts there, so it's very difficult to predict. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Got it. And the follow-up question, someone previously asked about the performance of your new stores. Just wondered if you could clarify it. And just given that you opened some more new stores, how would you characterize overall the performance of the stores? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, as a group, with all of our new -- the new stores are at or above our expectations. So we're very pleased with how openings have been going. And yes, it's a pretty diverse set of stores, too, spread out across the country, and that will be the case going forward as well. So just what we're really focused on is continuing to improve our business model each and every day and make sure that when we open a store, we have an experienced CarMax team in place, so when a customer walks in the door, they get a great experience. And we've been very pleased with how that's gone so far. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : And one more follow-up, if I could, just going back on subprime. Again, so I think someone else asked, is there -- could you -- is there any way you could tell the reason behind the change in behavior of your partners? The question I have, have you seen anything that suggests that the performance of these subprime loans is actually deteriorating? Thomas W. Reedy: Well, we don't participate in this space, so I can't really comment on that. But I think I would hypothesize that they're -- they have not been as happy with what they've seen -- that they've originated over the last 2 years, and they're adjusting their portfolio accordingly. Thomas J. Folliard: Look, a number of times over the last several quarters we've said that our subprime providers have gotten more and more comfortable and more and more aggressive with the CarMax origination channel. It just makes sense that, at some point, you'd bump up against some performance metric and probably have to scale back a little bit. But again, we don't run their business. They run their own business. We're happy to have them as third-party providers, and -- but we're going to expect some movement in the way they lend over time. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes. And as we mentioned, that profitability difference is significant, so we're actually happy to trade 3 of those for 1 CAF sale anytime you tell us and any time we could take that trade. Thomas J. Folliard: That's why it's another difficult thing to really figure out because, I mentioned all those other moving parts earlier, it doesn't take a lot of non-tier 3 sales to make up for 1 point or 2 of loss. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'll start with a quick one on subprime and then move in a different direction. I assume that this has no impact on the fee that you will pay to your origination partners. Thomas W. Reedy: No, it doesn't. As Tom said, we don't influence their behavior. The one way that we could theoretically do it is by paying them more or less, but I think you've seen when we've announced our tests, we've elected to leave that as it is and figure out the business a little bit better ourselves. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That helps. And then just changing direction here, on the real estate side, Tom, I know part of the strong return on capital that you generate is because you've got a good real estate team that buys real estate at the right price. What are you seeing in that market today? And do you feel like you can still get the kind of returns as with those rates -- or those costs go up? Thomas J. Folliard: We feel pretty good. We've not committed to a single piece of real estate that we didn't think we could make a very good return on. So are there things that are -- coming out of the recession, were there things that were less expensive than they were before? Sure. And now, going into places like -- look -- it's starting to look at Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Philly, are they places that are more expensive? Absolutely, but we expect to sell more cars there. And we've also done a nice job over the last few years of improving our profitability. So in terms of availability and our ability to make a great return, it's been no problem at all. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And with respect to reconditioning costs, obviously, you've moved the needle there over time. Is there still any room at all to reduce costs there? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, we do still think there's some room. I think it's -- as we've said before, the next 50 or 100 will be a lot more difficult than the first 250 or so. But it's a constant effort for our teams to try to figure out how to get more consistent and how to eliminate waste from the system and, at the same time, not compromise our quality. So I think our store teams have done a fantastic job to this point, and I expect to still be able to make progress going forward. Operator : And your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : It will be remiss of me not to ask at least one subprime question here. Thomas J. Folliard: We might have to valid check [ph] you and just say, \"Look, we've already answered that question 7 times.\" Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And I've heard that from you before, actually. So I guess my question is, where are you comfortable with subprime penetration levels? I mean, historically, you guys have kind of talked about -- Tom, you've kind of talked about 20%-ish kind of level. But now you're experimenting it with -- experimenting yourselves with subprime. Like has the thought process in terms of how much subprime is going to be as a total of your business started to change? Thomas W. Reedy: Scot, I don't think it has at all. We don't know the right number, but one thing, I think, we need to be clear about is we're not intending to drive subprime penetration at our business up by getting into this initiative here. As I said, we're looking at potentially being one of several partners. We'll have our own set of credit parameters and our own origination model, which we do not expect to be more aggressive than our partners. So I don't think we're giving any indication that we think we're moving -- trying to move the needle on how much subprime is in the business. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, that's correct. That's not our goal at all in doing this. We don't expect this to have, really, any impact whatsoever on the percentage of sales represented by subprime. Thomas W. Reedy: Yes, we're looking at whether it makes sense to take a share of the profit and to try to mitigate risk. Thomas J. Folliard: We've been getting asked for years about the amount of money we pay to get one of these deals done and wouldn't it make sense to think about it differently, and that's what we're trying to do. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Understood. So it's really a substitution effect here. But historically, you've also talked about you're kind of comfortable with 20% penetration levels of subprime. Does that thought process change if the new model is, let's call it, significantly more profitable than what the old subprime model had been? Thomas W. Reedy: No, I don't think it does. As I said, we're not looking to expand the amount of subprime in our channel. And when you look at the amount of subprime business that we do, it's not out of line with the marketplace overall. We've got -- we've looked at external data to that point, so we're not -- I think subprime is going to be what it is based on customer flow through the door and who's applying and what's going on in the economy. And we'll run a business that makes -- if we -- if this test is successful, we'll run a business that makes economic sense. But I don't think we have -- I feel comfortable that we're not out of line with the mix of subprime in the auto space, in the used auto space, and we're not trying to drive it up. Thomas J. Folliard: And, Scot, we've never really put a number on that. What I've always said about this segment of business is each incremental -- each individual customer, first of all, is getting a great deal at CarMax because we're not changing the price because they happen to be in this segment. Second of all, we've been subsidizing the deal by paying a discount to get them done. And we deliver very high-quality products. So I think if you're in this credit space, we're a terrific place to buy a very high-quality car and get a great experience that maybe you can't get elsewhere. And also, since these lenders don't see the loan until all of the other providers have declined, we've been sure that these customers and these sales are 100% incremental. So despite the fact that they're lesser in terms of profitability, it's 100% incremental profit. So on an individual customer basis, we feel really, really good about this offering. And as Tom said, when you look at it as a percentage of our total sales, we're going to sell 0.5 million cars this year. You would expect us to be somewhat representative of what kind of credit mix looks like in the U.S., and that's kind of where we are right now. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, understood. I will ask about the test that you're doing, though. Like some of your -- some of the loans within your typical CAF portfolio are already subprime if you just kind of look at what FICO scores are and APRs and the securitizations. Why the call out about the test? Because you don't want the blended FICO score or credit quality of existing securitizations to change? Thomas W. Reedy: Well, if you think of -- you're absolutely right, Scot, that we do serve a wide spectrum of credit, as I mentioned before, and we're looking at this as expansion. But the way credit routes in our business is it goes to CAF, it goes to our Tier 2 lenders, it goes to our Tier 3 lenders. We want our customers to have an opportunity to get all those various offers and get the best financing for them. And this is just -- in this particular space are customers that we have not served before, and... Thomas J. Folliard: But I would say that you're right, in that some of the stuff we originate ends up performing like this, which gives us more confidence in our ability to manage it. Because we've been managing receivables, although it's a small percentage, it's still a big enough chunk that we feel like we have experience to do this well. And part of calling it out is to separate it out and look at it as a separate investment and see if we can make a return on it. But if we just originated this different set of business and put it into the securitization, we wouldn't get as good -- as favorable terms as we're currently getting. And once we get this all -- a test in place and we decide whether or not we want to go forward, we'll figure out how to fund it then. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's all very helpful. And then just one more question regarding wholesale. Looks like wholesale units were a bit sluggish. I know you guys don't break out comps for the business, but given the store growth, it would suggest that the comp will be in negative territory, which just seems odd given kind of the strength in the rest of your business. Any thoughts there, Tom? Thomas J. Folliard: No, I still think -- I've always thought that wholesale and retail, over time, will grow around the same. And you've been following us for a long time, you've seen huge swings that don't necessarily match up. If you go back to 2001, I know that's a long term to look at it, our wholesale growth and our retail comps have been about the same, but -- and I expect that over time. So 4% this quarter compared to 15% sales growth is a little bit off, but I think, over time, they'll be more closely aligned. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : But nothing that you noticed in terms of why the wholesale unit growth was slower this quarter, maybe buying fewer vehicles or something? Thomas J. Folliard: No, I mean, clearly, we bought more because we had growth, but not as many as what our sales growth would have predicted. But in terms of our buy rate, it was very strong, and we don't see any reason to worry about it. Operator : And your next question is from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It's Dan Galves for Rod. I came on the call a little late, has anybody asked about subprime yet? Thomas W. Reedy: That was good. Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I got a couple of questions. The first one is related to the new stores that are kind of now in the comp base, would expect that they're growing faster as they ramp up to the corporate average. Do you see that as providing a meaningful positive to your same-store -- overall same-store comps yet? Or is that something still to come? Thomas J. Folliard: It's all just built into the comp expectation. And remember, too, that the base is so much bigger that even when you get a store at, say, its second year and it has a higher percentage comp growth, it's a very small number of units in the big scheme of things, so... Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : But as you end up with like 30, 40 stores in the next couple of years that are in year 2 and year 3, do you see that as being a potential positive to comps? Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, but as we've talked about a comp range in the past of something like 4% to 8%, we think that range is still a pretty good one. One other thing to remember is we're going to open a lot of stores back into existing markets. So sometimes, a satellite store can actually hurt comps in the other stores because there is some cannibalization. So it's a pretty complex model to figure out. Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got it. Got it. And then the last one is the third-party finance fees, just rough math, if you divide that by the subprime volume in your business, you get to about $800 per unit. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there -- is there third-party finance income in there as well? It's just looking -- go ahead. Thomas W. Reedy: We've said this before, in our subprime segment, today, we pay about $1,000 a car to the third-party provider. Operator : And your next question is from Rick Nelson from Stephens. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I'd like to ask you about provision for loan loss. It looks like it picked up sequentially. If you could speak to delinquencies, what you're seeing there. Thomas W. Reedy: The provision for loan loss picked up dollar-wise year-over-year, but as a percent of receivables, it's flat. And if you're saying sequentially over the quarter, this is the time of year where we'll typically see, coming into the holiday season, delinquencies may pick up a little bit, but that's a normal seasonal trend. People are focused on other payments. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got it. Also, I'm curious about the CFPB, they've put out a bulletin in March, how that's affecting your other third-party credit providers and if that's having any impact at CAF? Thomas W. Reedy: I don't -- to date, it's had no impact to CAF as we have not been visited yet. We have spoken with our third-party providers who have had interaction with the CFPB. I don't believe it's impacting any of our business. It's -- their focus is on a couple of things : one is making sure that people are treated equally and fairly; two, that the products aren't overly profitable. But as I said, as far as Wells Fargo or Cap One and the impact on the business they're doing with us, we haven't seen any. Operator : And your next question is from Jamie Albertine from Stifel. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I dialed in a little bit late. I just wanted to follow up, if I could, on the SG&A side of things. We've talked about it both with you guys at your Analyst Day and I've heard you referred to it on prior conference calls. But from an SG&A per unit perspective, can you just remind us kind of where we are today versus prior peak? And you've done a really good job of sort of highlighting the opportunities on items like reconditioning costs coming down, and it sounds like there's still room to go there. But maybe if you can talk sort of high level about your top 2 or 3 priorities as it relates to SG&A cost reductions and, therefore, leverage as you -- your growth story sort of plays out for the next 2 or 3 years. Thomas J. Folliard: Yes, I don't really know what the peak was, but we were down almost $100 per unit sold in the third quarter compared to last year. You referenced reconditioning costs. Remember, reconditioning costs are in cost of goods sold, not in SG&A, so we kind of try to think of those 2 things as 1 big bucket of opportunity. We will eclipse $1 billion of SG&A this year and probably, I don't know, $600 million or so of reconditioning. So it's a pretty big opportunity to try to find efficiencies. And in terms of our priorities, it's largely -- in the SG&A bucket, it's largely going to be around how do we operate our stores consistently, how do we staff better, how do we make sure we're properly staffed for peaks and for valleys in terms of traffic and sales. And it's a pretty seasonal business, it's a pretty labor-intensive business, so there's lots of opportunities to try and get more and more efficient in that regard. So that's kind where our efforts are focused there. We're really proud of all the progress we've made on the cost of goods sold side in terms of reconditioning. But I think with SG&A, there's probably some opportunity in there, and we're focused on going after it. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I should have clarified that, and I apologize, and I appreciate you calling that out on the COGS side. Is it fair to say then that if you look at the 2 buckets, it's predominantly going to be more SG&A-driven from this point going forward, given that the bulk of reconditioning improvement you've already performed [ph]? Thomas J. Folliard: Not necessarily because the bulk -- remember, the bulk of SG&A is going to be rents and advertising. And some of the fixed overheads we can only make so much progress on. We have to have enough people in our stores to have them up and running and pay our bills. So I think when you look at the 2 buckets and you break it out into things that are somewhat less manageable, let's say, then there's opportunity in both. Operator : And your final question is from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Tom and Tom, this is the first we've heard of any hiccups in the overall subprime model lending market. And you mentioned earlier that you do not believe that this is CarMax-specific. What -- I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what you're hearing or seeing in the market that leads you to believe that this is beyond CarMax? Thomas W. Reedy: No, I think -- we've had conversations with our partners. And as I've mentioned, they have CarMax as a part of their overall portfolio. And they fine tune that portfolio and their origination standards based on what they're experiencing. And I think that is the result of us, other business they're doing. And all I can say is that they have indicated that this is not a CarMax-specific issue. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : If the subprime consumer is starting to get a little overextended with debt, particularly auto-related debt, how does that impact your view on this test that you're now doing? And it sounds like it might be -- you might be extending that at just the wrong time. How do you look at that? Thomas W. Reedy: If you believe the market has been overheated over the last couple years, then the last couple years would have been the wrong time to enter this. We're not trying to time the market. We're not trying to figure out what's the best time to enter it. This is a longer-term initiative. The reason we're going now is because we're ready to go now. We've been working on it for over a year. And we're in a position where we believe we can start originating and servicing sometime this quarter. And remember, this is a very small test for us. This is smaller than other tests we run at CAF as far as pricing and in terms. And at the end of the day, while we are going into it expecting to make some money, it's not material to our overall business or even to CAF's overall portfolio. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Understood. Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question. The increase in allowance on ESP returns, what was the dollar amount on a pretax basis? Thomas W. Reedy: It's about -- it's $0.02. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Right. What is the dollar amount on a pretax basis? Thomas W. Reedy: Yes, we don't disclose -- we haven't disclosed dollar amounts on our estimate adjustments. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. Thomas J. Folliard: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays. Thanks for all your support and continued interest. And of course, thanks to all of our associates for their dedication and their hard work and what they do every day to make CarMax what it is today. We'll talk to you again next quarter. Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Well all-in-all, it was a great year for CarMax I\u2019ll go through some of the highlights of the year and of the quarter. First for the year total revenues were up 15% to a little over $12.5 billion. Used unit comps increased by 12%, our strongest comp performance since fiscal 2002 and total used units grew by 18%. Wholesale units up 5%, CAF income grew 12% to more than $336 million, net earnings grew 13% to a record $493 million and net earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $2.16. On the market share front our data indicates that we increased our share of the zero to 10 year old used vehicle markets by about 17%, bringing our total to approximately 5%. We also opened 13 stores during the fiscal year, the most in any year in our history. As for the fourth quarter, used unit comps up 7%, that\u2019s a combination of a modest traffic improvement and continued improvements in conversion and total used units grew by 12%. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 12%; used vehicle gross profit per unit was $2,141 in both this and last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Wholesale units increased by 2%, and have a little bit more than 30% our appraisal buy rate was slightly higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our gross profit per vehicle fell $32 to $953 per unit. CAF quarterly income grew by 6% to $81 million this quarter. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom Reedy. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. CAF delivered another solid year with income up 12% and average managed receivables growing 23% to more than $7 billion. In the fourth quarter, CAF income grew 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Weighted average contract rate, the average rate charged to customers, has been relatively stable over the past several quarters. For accounts originated during the quarter the rate was 7.2% compared to 7.1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 7% in this year\u2019s third quarter. The allowance for the loan losses increased to $70 million in line with growth in managed receivables and a 1% flat as percentage of net receivables compared to last year. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 4% to $1 billion. Our net penetration was 40% for the current year\u2019s fourth quarter versus 43% for the prior year's fourth quarter. Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 17% of our sales in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s flat year-over-year which represent some moderation versus the first three quarters where we saw an increase to 5 points in Q1 and 3 points in each of Q2 and Q3. As we said in the press release, we launched our test in January to learn more about originating and servicing customers who would typically be funded by our subprime providers. During the quarter, we originated $9 million. It\u2019s very early in this process and we will share information and learnings once it is appropriate. Before I turn the call back to Tom, I will take a moment to discuss the accounting correction associated with our cancellation of reserves for the ESP and GAP products. During the fourth quarter, we developed a new approach to projecting cancellations for ESP and GAP. Our previous method works well historically when trends were relatively stable. However, we learned it was too slow to identify changes in underlying cancellation trends. Over time, modifications to the products and our administration of them along with an evolution in our business, meaning a greater percentage of our sales coming from subprime financing caused changes in the overall cancellation profile of these products. We failed to adequately reflect these changes in our cancellation reserve and have made the Q4 correction described in the release. We are now using a more sophisticated model that takes more granular view of the data and we believe we will provide a better and more timely identification of changes in cancellation trends. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. SG&A for the fiscal year increased 12%, to $1.2 billion on a per unit basis, that\u2019s a decline of $102 a car, to $2,161 compared to $2,263 in fiscal \u201913 driven by our 12% CAFs. As you know SG&A expenses are largely fixed variable expenses represent approximately 25% to 30% of our cost structure. During the fourth quarter we opened five stores including our entry into the Philadelphia market with two stores, we also added one in each of our existing markets in St. Louis, Washington and Baltimore and Sacramento. After the fourth quarter ended, we opened stores in two new markets, Dothan, Alabama and Rochester, New York. Including these two stores we currently plans to open 13 stores in fiscal 2015 including the opening of our first store in the Cleveland market which is notable since it is Katharine\u2019s home town. Katharine Kenny : Yes. Tom Folliard : While our store traffic has increased modestly during fiscal \u201914 our web traffic continues to expand significantly. For the year, average monthly web visits grew to 12 million, up 32% compared to fiscal \u201913, and by the end of the year average monthly visits had grown to over 13 million a month with visits to our mobile site representing approximately 30% of that and our mobile app traffic is about 12% of the total. And lastly we are pleased that after the end of the year CarMax\u2019s board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion expansion to our share repurchase program. And with that we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities; your line is open. Matt Nemer : A couple of questions. First, Tom, could you talk to the weather impact to the quarter? I don\u2019t know if you measured store days lost or some function of that, would be curious what the impact was. Tom Folliard : Yes, I am sure there was impact in the quarter. We don\u2019t do a store days lost Matt, but you know in my memory we had it one day where we had 30 stores closed. We had days when we had the entire Dallas market closed which I don\u2019t really remember that happening. Historically we have always felt like we get those sales back and they might shift from quarter to quarter. So it is very difficult for us to attribute a sales loss or gain to a quarter because of weather. But it was obviously pretty significant as I said, with the number of closed stores; it also has an impact on our ability to produce cars. So it is a combination of traffic for sales and the shops being shut down and not being able to get inventory out front, I think the stores have done a fantastic job of working through some very challenging circumstances during the quarter to put us in a good position going forward, but there is no question it had an impact, I just can\u2019t really quantify. Matt Nemer : Okay, great. And then secondly, could you just talk to what impact the mix to subprime has had on ESP revenue over the last year, so just explain, or help explain maybe what is different about that purchase from an ESP standpoint? Tom Folliard : Hey Matt, from an ESP standpoint, there is not a dramatic difference in our penetration between subprime and other sources funded through our channel, meaning CAF or other partners. We do see a difference, we don\u2019t see as attachment of the ESP product, if customer does not finance internally with CAF or with one of our partners. But to the point, on the reserve through, I mean, the increase in the subprime customers as the percent of sales, if you could step back and think about, as subprime has got a higher default rate. The biggest reason we see a return to ESP is because of the customer exiting the car that could be because they bought another car that could be because they\u2019ve got repossessed or something else going on for financing. So as there has been a higher percentage of subprime in the business the ESP returns have evolved this much. As far as the attach 30 ESP in our penetration there is not a significant difference between subprime and another channel within CarMax. Tom Folliard : So it\u2019s no real impact on revenue Matt just on the returns. Matt Nemer : Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : I want to maybe shove a couple questions into one question, all tied around subprime. So, Tom Folliard, when you reported your third-quarter results, you called out a -- I guess it was somewhat of a disruption in the subprime relationship with one of your partners. So maybe if we can get an update on that, in the last three months, what you have seen there. Then the follow-up to that would be, as you look at the subprime penetration, which is now 17%, flat year-on-year, is that CarMax topping that out? Or is there some other factor out there that is basically keeping it from growing year-on-year? Tom Folliard : Well, certainly not CarMax topping it out, and what we talked about it at the end of the third quarter was a slight pullback we saw from our subprime providers and as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks we saw subprime as a percent of sales grow by a few points at each of the first three quarters so we continue to see some of the behaviors that we\u2019ve seen out of our partners in terms of getting more aggressive with the origination channel that CarMax provides. And at the end of the third quarter, we mainly noted that we saw that pullback some we didn\u2019t assign a magnitude to it because we weren\u2019t so sure and as it has come out in the fourth quarter, this is still a very strong quarter for us, it\u2019s a big percentage mix of our sales at 17% it\u2019s flat year-over-year. So we can\u2019t control what our subprime providers do or any of our lenders for that matter they have all their own models. They see these loan applications after they\u2019ve been declined by everybody else. They\u2019re terrific partners they\u2019ve been a great add to our business and they allow us to offer credit terms to a full suite of credit profile that enter our store each and every day. So that\u2019s how it came out for the quarter, how they\u2019ll move going forward, it\u2019s very difficult to say but all we were talking about at the end of the third quarter was we didn\u2019t expect to see continued expansion as it relates to the percent of sales. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question relates to CAF so if we look at the loss ratio that you experienced this quarter the prior two year seasonally that number had come down year on year it was up a bit which is not the first time that had been the case in recent years but it was up a bit more than we\u2019ve seen for a few quarter. So any comments on the moves and the loss ratio and what that means how that reflects your experience in marketplace? Tom Reedy : No Matt I don\u2019t think there is anything to call out particularly in the loss ratio where it\u2019s at today is essentially what we would expected based on the evolution of our portfolio and the expense we have done over the last couple of years. I will comment that weather does impact credit as well with people being able to make payment, make calls et cetera but we don\u2019t think there is the big impact there. If you remember last quarter we did talk about it favorable loss experience in the third quarter and early in the year that was something that didn\u2019t materialize this quarter, so that would explain a little bit of it as well. As far as losses we\u2019re not seeing anything unusual. Tom Folliard : Yes actually in line with our expectations. Matthew Fassler : Then as relates to subprime, as we think big-picture about this business, can you talk about the cost of servicing a subprime loan over the life of that loan, compared to servicing a higher-quality credit? Tom Reedy : Yes Matt I mean obviously if you think about subprime the cost of servicing is going to be significantly higher than the average of our portfolio. But I would point out that it\u2019s not going to be dramatically higher than kind of the lowest stand of what we already do in the CAF business. We already do a pretty wide spectrum, and obviously we\u2019re accounting for that accordingly in our estimation of whether it makes sense from a profitability perspective or not. Tom Folliard : I think we have quite a bit of experience with frequent contact with customers. Matthew Fassler : If we think about the $1,000 bogie, which is currently roughly what you pay your third-party partners, and we think about the cost to bring that in-house, should we assume that that compares favorably to the fees you pay to third parties? Tom Reedy : I mean Matt I think we\u2019re going into this test not as similar we\u2019re going to breakeven it or not make money with this product from the perspective of so we intent to go forward and if this thing make sense we would intent to have the finance piece on its own been viable from a profitability perspective. The $1,000 that we avoid from the discounts from the third party lenders will be incremental to that. Tom Folliard : But it\u2019s merely part of the calculation, clearly part of the calculation we would so many things go as we would hope we\u2019d expect to make money on the financing independent of that 1,000, so the answer is yes it would be (multiple speakers) Matthew Fassler : Okay. Then finally, just by way of cleanup, last year I think you originally disclosed 15% penetration for third-party subprime providers. A couple of our clients have called this out to us. This year you identified the penetration at 17% and said that was flat with a year ago. So are you essentially restating the year-ago penetration of subprime? Tom Folliard : We are not restating it, Matt, but there is a program we have that\u2019s a lead generation program that has become a more significant part of the business. So, as it got to the point where it mattered in the number, we started adding it in and really back just to make sure that things are consistent year-over-year. Matthew Fassler : All right. We will clean that up with Katharine later. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I know it hasn't been a ton of time since you have had the smaller format stores. But I am just curious, as you have changed the operations for those smaller markets, if there is anything yet that you are seeing that maybe you can extrapolate and back-solve from an operational efficiency standpoint to your more large historical stores. Tom Folliard : That\u2019s a good question Sharon and it is still a little bit early. We only have, we have three of those stores opened now that we opened Dothan, Alabama and we have not yet rolled anything back into the existing stores. But I do think there will be opportunities there particularly around labor sharing and the ability to cross-train people to do multiple things in the store as oppose to in our higher volume stores if you are a buyer or you are in the business office or you are in sales, you can stay busy doing that one thing whereas in one of these smaller stores you really have to be able to do multiple things and that\u2019s true for both commission associates and hourly associates. So, I think some of those learnings, we will absolutely be able to go back into the bigger stores. We haven\u2019t had a chance to do that yet nor have we had enough time to read the results. But so far we have the three stores open and some of the things that we have to do in that store like leverage inventory on a grander scale, have more rapid transfers to make sure customers have access to more inventory than just a 100 cars representing that store that stuff is all working very smoothly so far. But we don\u2019t have much else to report in terms of results. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Good morning. My question is around subprime as well. I just would like to better understand. In the course of the last few months or in the next few months, do you plan on testing or signing up any other third-party providers to fill that gap that is left by the pullback with one of your current providers? Tom Folliard : I would say no. We can\u2019t get across the spectrum of our lending with our partners we are always testing but where do we test is we look and see if the lender brings incremental values to the table meaning that they are proving things others don\u2019t and to the extent partners either fits in Tier 2 or the Tier 3 space, if do that, we will consider. But we are very happy with our relationships. One nice thing about CarMax and our growth plan is we believe there is room for us to potentially participate in that space and for our partners to continue to grow their business as well that\u2019s the benefit of building stores every year and taking market share. And in terms of a pull back, Seth, it really as you see in the fourth quarter, just came out flat, it\u2019s not a pull back, it\u2019s a pull back on the growth rate. But in terms of, again being able to provide great offers to a whole suite of credit customers in our stores, it came through again in the fourth quarter to work really well. Seth Basham : Right, understood. So you look forward -- I don't know if you want to provide any forward-looking guidance; but would you expect that trend to persist, where you won't see any further penetration of subprime into 2014? Tom Folliard : As you know Seth, we don\u2019t provide any forward-looking guidance but again we can\u2019t control at our models. Tom Reedy : That\u2019s going to depend on the appetite of our lenders and what they are seeing in the business that they originates through our channel and we want them to run a profitable business. Our main goal is to have a sustainable source of financing for all of our customers. Seth Basham : Right. Last related question is just on your subprime test. When do you expect to have conclusive evidence whether or not you're going to pursue it more broadly? Tom Folliard : I mean I would say it\u2019s going to be at least a year. Tom Reedy : Yes, our plan is to originate about $70 million as Tom mentioned earlier we are up to about 9 and then it\u2019s going to take a lot of the results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned in the press release that your share of the 1 to 10-year-old car market is up 17%. Can you give us the number of cars in that cohort and what your actual market share is? Tom Folliard : Well we also mentioned our actual market share is approximately 5% of 0 to 10 year old cars sold. I am not sure of the number; 21 million Katharine says the number of cars in that cohort. So, I mean it\u2019s a really great share gain. We have the best comps we have had since 2002 and I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front me but it\u2019s as good a share gain as I can remember over the last several years. Value of the used car market is still, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s growing rapidly, so it\u2019s still either flat or slightly down depending on whose estimate you look at. So, we are really pleased with our ability to continue to grow share. Craig Kennison : And can I have a follow-up, can you tell us what\u2019s your best market share is on a local basis? Tom Folliard : We have talked about 10% to 15% depending on the age of the store and every market is little bit different and some markets aren\u2019t fully stored but we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable number over a long period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the sensitivity between CAF penetration rates and the slightly higher collateral coupon rates we saw in the latest securitization? Logically it makes sense, but is there an intention to start to tighten up credit a little bit on the CAF side? Tom Folliard : No anything that you\u2019re seeing on the CAF side is going to be mostly a byproduct of what\u2019s coming through the door. I mean as we mentioned before we\u2019re continually testing on pricing and different pockets of credit that we can look at. But from a big picture perspective we have not changed our approach and there is nothing to read into that. Scot Ciccarelli : So you don\u2019t think the slightly higher collateral coupon rate that you are charging customers impacted their take rate at all? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s more function of the market Scot, yes. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Then just a follow-up. Can you provide any more color regarding how we should think about SG&A trends during the next year or two? You guys had to do a lot of, let's call it investment spending, before you started on your store growth path. We are up and running now, and obviously that compares against a lean infrastructure. And again, without providing specific guidance, just a better way to think about SG&A trends. Thanks. Tom Folliard : I think you\u2019re referring to us restarting our store growth plan which we\u2019re in full swing now and as we mentioned we opened 13 stores this year we plan to open another 10 to 15 for the next three also. But that\u2019s been a steady build up. So that\u2019s a cost pressure we\u2019ve had to overcome. As you saw in our results if we can deliver comps at this level, we\u2019re going to provide some pretty good leverage on a per unit basis over time. And we also pointed out this time that about 25% to 30% of our total SG&A cost is variable and that number is going to flex up and down with sales. But as we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re still in a growth mode, we\u2019re not growing significantly more next year than we did this year but there is still quite a bit of cost around growth, there is quite a bit of cost around fringes and some changes in kind of some of the fixed cost base. And we continue to make investments in our business. So again I feel like as long as we can deliver solid comps we\u2019ll be able to leverage SG&A pretty well. Scot Ciccarelli : So Tom Reedy I think you have talked about kind of what comp you would need to leverage SG&A historically? What would that number look like today? Tom Reedy : I think we have nothing different; it\u2019s the same kind of level that 48% comp, mid to high single-digit we think we got some leverage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley your line is open. Yijay Ying : Morning, everyone. This is Yijay in for Ravi. Just one question for me before I jump back in the queue. Could you provide a bit more color on the mix of your used cars that you sold in the quarter? And maybe just comment on how that has evolved over time and how you think that will impact your gross margin going forward. Tom Folliard : Yeah, we have talked about this in the past and we\u2019ve done as you can look at our numbers over the last several years as our mix has moved and changed, we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job of managing margin around that. So we\u2019re not thinking that a mix shift is going to impact our ability to manage margins. But we really haven\u2019t seen much in the way of mix shift over the last couple of years. In terms of mix of age our zero to four mix remains approximately 70% of our total sales and our five to 10 year mix is around 30%. As you remember a few years ago we talked about that number of five to 10 year old cars having doubled, coming out of the recession from 15% to around 30%. But that number has been pretty stable for the last couple of years. And we really didn\u2019t see much in terms of a mix shift in sport utilities or compacts or anything of that nature. So last couple of years it\u2019s been relatively stable in terms of mix. Yijay Ying : In terms of the age then just a quick follow up. Do you expect that to improve, maybe improve is the wrong word but do you expect zero to five to increase this year and over the next couple of years then? Tom Folliard : We have been anticipating with the increase in SAAR that we would see our mix of zero to four year old cars increase; it just didn\u2019t happen over the last couple of years. So do we expect going forward at some point? Yes, but we\u2019ve also seen a slowdown in the SAAR growth, I think it ended a little over 16 million at the end of last month and I think only like a 2% growth. But that\u2019s really the driver of supply obviously. So the other factor is going to be consumer behavior and how quickly do they trade out cars and that\u2019s just something we really can\u2019t predict. But over time we would expect our mix to start to move a little bit more in that direction as the supply comes back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Your line is open. James Albertine : Great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning, everyone. Just to follow on to a prior question as it related to the aggregate used vehicle market, I think you mentioned flat to slightly down in aggregate, but yet 17% share gains for you specifically. I am sure you probably have the data. Is there a way to sort of help us get to the bottom of -- is it negative sort of person-to-person transactions that\u2019s offsetting growth in retail formats? So it\u2019s said another way, are the retail formats actually growing relative to that commentary around flat to slightly down for the aggregate marketplace? Tom Folliard : Well that is -- what we\u2019re talking about is retail not wholesale. So I am not really sure of your question. James Albertine : Okay. I wanted to make sure I understood that correctly then. Tom Folliard : Based on retail cars sold, when we look at our wholesale business of whatever north of 300,000 units sold, those are all not included in the transaction -- I\u2019m sorry, included in the share calculation. The share calculation is only of cars retail. And we have talked about this data set in the past. It\u2019s a difficult data set to get your arms around. Approximately a third of all cars resale are sold from person to person. That number has been pretty stable over the last several years. And this is our best estimate. It\u2019s the way we have been doing it for years and it\u2019s our best estimate. Share and - I am not sure it\u2019s exactly precise but I am sure that we\u2019ve gained share pretty significantly and had a level that - as good as we\u2019ve seen in several years. James Albertine : If I can, and I know that you don't give intrayear granularity, but given the surge in the off-lease vehicles that we are seeing come back into the marketplace, is there a tendency -- do your share gains incrementally ramp as that surge has progressed? Said another way, back half of last year maybe did those share gains accelerate as far as you saw it? Tom Folliard : We never really correlated share gains with changes in supplies that relates to leases. Having been here for 20 years and seeing lease percentages as a percent of new cars sold move up and down over that time period and then subsequently those cars coming back into the market place, if not really something that we have seen as a predictable variable to say that we would either gain more share or sell more cars. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Edelstein with Stephens Inc; your line is open. Joe Edelstein : Hi, good morning. Each month we look at the monthly securitization filings that you put on the website. But the piece that we just don't get a lot of visibility on is what is in the warehouse and what is happening there. Could you just give us an update as to what the average net spread on those loans look like? Should we just assume that it is similar to the most recent securitization, which was down closer to like a 6.2% (multiple speakers) spread? Tom Folliard : I think, looking at the securitization is a good proxy, because you can lock down on what actually out there. We are also giving you this data every quarter on our originations. And so from, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that you could get on what\u2019s going on in the warehouse, looking at the quarterly origination information and then kind of combining that with what you got up there in the public domain. And things are moving relatively quickly from the warehouse to the securitization\u2026 Tom Reedy : We are doing one every quarter these days, based on the origination of the CAFs. I think it is pretty decent proxy. Joe Edelstein : Right. I guess as the timing of those newer securitizations do become a bigger part of the portfolio mix and you roll off the older, higher-rate deals, can you comment at all on what your expectation would be for net spreads as we progress throughout this year? Tom Folliard : I mean, we\u2019ve not given any guidance about things going forward for a couple of years. But I think if you -- I think you can take the data out there on securitization and you can kind of see how to work itself through. It usually takes us couple of years for things to work through after we make the change in rate or you can observe a change in spread, and we expect that \u2013 Joe Edelstein : And the expense is steadily declining here for the last couple of years and that\u2019s kind of just that what we should expect going forward at this point? Tom Folliard : I think we should expect it\u2019s going to be where the market leads it to be. And we are going to provide a competitive rate of financing per customer, that\u2019s the most important thing that we do with CAF, as we are sitting in the catbird seat, if you will, as far as looking at those amounts, first we have provided competitive product. Cost of fund is going to be what it is and we\u2019re going to charge what the market allows us. That\u2019s why we continuously-- and you know the spread that we\u2019re living at today is significantly better than historic levels still. And we are very happy with the profitability level of CAF. It started having growth going forward, that\u2019s going to give by-products of them providing competitive offer and us growing core business in a number of sales that we run through the CarMax channel. Joe Edelstein : Sure. If I may just ask one more question about the provision rate, that provision rate has picked up sequentially throughout the year. I guess there are some seasonality factors I am sure that go into that calculation. But can you just speak a little bit more directly to your calculation process there related to the provision? Should we model it and expect it to step up throughout the coming year as well? Tom Folliard : All I could comment is, as I did earlier that I think the provision for loan losses is in line with our expectations, where it should be for the portfolio, and that\u2019s pretty much in line as far as we can talk about going forward. Joe Edelstein : Okay. Do you have the ending delinquency balance handy, by chance? I know you will put that in the filing, but just if you have that. Tom Folliard : Yes, Katharine and Celeste can get back if you wanted to, and give some detail on that. Joe Edelstein : Just a couple of follow-ups. That\u2019s all. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates; your line is open. Bill Armstrong : Good morning. A question about market share. I think you said earlier you have about 5% total share. I assume that is throughout the United States. Could you update us on some of your more mature markets where you've got a lot of penetration, like Chicago, Washington, Atlanta? What sort of share do you think you have there right now? Tom Folliard : Bill, first that number is not the entire United States, it\u2019s only the markets that we\u2019re in. Bill Armstrong : The only ones you are in, okay. Tom Folliard : May be a little more than half, so if you look at it as a share nationally it\u2019s probably approximately half of that. And I talked earlier about markets where we have seen more mature markets achieving somewhere in the 10% to 15% range that\u2019s about as high as it goes. We are not going to get into specific detail around markets but again and the data is, it\u2019s challenging dataset that we have tried to have a consistent way to look at it over a long period of time. And recently as our sales mix has moved into the older category and a more significant percentage, we will now report only 0 to 10 year old share which is more representative of what we fell in aggregate. Bill Armstrong : Right. In those more mature markets where you have had a significant presence for now a few car-buying cycles, do you see market share continuing to grow? Or is that stabilizing and leveling off? Tom Folliard : The reason I put a wide range around it is, it\u2019s just again it\u2019s a difficult measure. The second part is, in some of our more mature markets where we thought maybe it was only a three store market or a five store market because of our ability to grow, we have been able to go back in and add more stores which contributes to more share. So, we are still a relatively young company particularly if you look at the number of stores we have that have been through a couple of buying cycles. So, I think we got a long way to go to continue to learn but I think that\u2019s a pretty good range to work with what I said earlier. Bill Armstrong : Okay. Just one really quick follow-up. The ratio of wholesale cars to retail cars has been going down for the last few quarters. What is driving that trend? Can you remind us? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s a difficult one for us to get our arms around other than we think over a long period of time they will kind of grow around the same. And remember we have couple of years where the disconnect was gigantic in the other direction. Bill Armstrong : Yes. Tom Folliard : Where our wholesale approximately doubled over two years, so it\u2019s really strong volumes. We run a great auction business. We have great wholesale customers that support us each and every week and I think we provide great customer service and it\u2019s been a terrific part of the total CarMax diversified business model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hi, this is Liz Suzuki on for John. With the accounting correction, how should we think about modeling ESP and GAP revenue and gross profit going forward? Is it going to remain closer to the lower levels of this quarter? Or was that accounting correction just a one-time adjustment that shouldn't be ongoing? Tom Folliard : So, that\u2019s very good question Liz and it is an adjustment to take care of going back over the last few years but in terms of the magnitude of the dollars on a per contract basis, it\u2019s approximately 30 bucks. So, in terms of our ability to price that back, we would feel like that\u2019s a number that we could easily price back without much impact on penetration. Now that being said, the product itself has price changes all the time. We have been doing this for a long time over 20 years and as our partners learn more about the product and about the performance, we will see price changes. We do anticipate additional price changes this year to the product unrelated to the change required to get back the reserve. The impact that that will have on our penetration, we will have to see. We have also done a great job of training and developing our store teams to be able to sale the product. We think it\u2019s a great deal for our customers. Our customers who buy ESP product as a group are happier than those that don\u2019t. So, we continue to believe in it and although it\u2019s a minor adjustment on a per car basis, it obviously have the impact that it did and we believe we fixed it going forward. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. Just one quick one. Regarding used vehicle pricing, are you seeing any impact from the GM recall on the pricing of your inventory for Chevy, Pontiac, or Saturn vehicles? And are you hearing any concerns either from the ABS market or elsewhere about residual projections coming down? Tom Folliard : We have not yet, I am not saying that that won\u2019t happen but as of yet no, we haven\u2019t seen much of an impact on pricing or we certainly haven\u2019t heard anything from anybody in the lending world. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of avid Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Good morning. A question on the comp performance. You often cite improvements from improved execution in our stores. I was just wondering if you could get a little more detail about that. I mean, I assume it's been the same playbook all along. But what has been changing at a more granular level to be better? Tom Folliard : It kind of is the same playbook, so it\u2019s not, and I couldn\u2019t point to any one thing. I just think our teams have done a really great job. We are also more experienced, we have some more experienced sales people in our stores who are better at selling. We have talked about credit in the past being a factor, car quality is a factor, having the right inventory in the right place at the right time is a factor for conversion. So, conversion is a multi-person effort. It\u2019s not just a sales person in the store. It\u2019s a combination of whole bunch of different things, I think the initiatives that we have worked on over the last several years to get more efficient and become a better operator, I think have also helped. So, it really is a combination of things and I really couldn\u2019t be more proud of our store teams for how hard they have worked over the last several years to continue to improve our execution. David Whiston : Okay. On the capital structure, is there any thoughts on ever taking on debt for buybacks? Tom Folliard : As you can see we have got a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet today. We are generating a lot of cash. So the answer to that, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We\u2019re obviously concerned about making sure we\u2019re returning capital to shareholder appropriately. That said I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be uncomfortable with more leverage in our capital structure and we have significant access to capital to the extent we wanted to do that. We\u2019ve got unused credit facility three quarters to the billion dollars and access to capital from a number of other venues if you wanted to. David Whiston : I guess related would be : what about a dividend? Tom Folliard : As I said we\u2019re constantly thinking about what\u2019s the best thing for our shareholders and if we have something to talk about on that front we will, but at this point there is nothing to talk about. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Two quick follow-ups. First, can you give us some color around tax refunds and how the year-over-year change in tax refunds tends to affect sales going through your store? Tom Folliard : The tax refund time for us is always a seasonally high time for sales and we have to get prepped up and make sure we have the inventory ready. If you remember last year there was a delay in the tax returns but I think we saw similar delay this year it\u2019s not something that we think impacts us over the year but it can shift sales from one quarter to the other. Although I think I am not exactly Tom I think was pretty similar to last year in terms of timing. Delayed last year and a little delayed this year as well. Seth Basham : Got you. The data I was looking at suggested that tax refunds are up 12% year-over-year through February. So I was wondering if that had to any extent a positive effect on your business. But I guess you don't have the data to show that. Tom Folliard : No. Seth Basham : Got you. All right. Then secondly as it relates to wholesale, can you help us connect the dots there? With wholesale sales down and ASPs down, your buy rates up, are you seeing more limited appraisal traffic or some other factor affecting the wholesale trends? Tom Folliard : The wholesale sales were up not down, margin was slightly down. But I mean we have seen, we went for a number of years where we saw an appreciating wholesale market which was obviously pretty unique and that provides the tailwind and for a number of different reasons I would say the last year or so have been what we would consider more of a normally depreciating market. So pretty strong buy rate, remember this is not a business that you can isolate and manage independently. It is absolutely attached to the retail business and to everything else that we do. So maintaining a strong buy rate, making sure that customers who come and want to sell us their car and also buy a car from us get a strong offer, so that they\u2019re likely to sell us their car and then in turn buy a car from us is one of the more important things that we do. So a buy rate of around 30% that\u2019s about as we have ever had in the quarter so wholesale comes out the way it does based on the amount of traffic that we get through the door. Seth Basham : Okay. So no big changes in the rate of change in appraisal traffic, and no big changes in the rate of cars going to retail versus wholesale that you buy? Tom Folliard : No. Operator : And we have no further question in queue at this time. Tom Folliard : Thank you operator and thank you everyone for your support and interest and just a couple of closing comments. The year when we celebrated our 20 year anniversary, we also have cumulative retail sales of over 5 million units and cumulative wholesale sales of almost 3 million units and in fiscal \u201814 alone we sold almost 870,000 total cars in those two categories. And I just want to thank our 21,000 CarMax associates for all they have done over the last 20 years to make this all possible. Thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll talk to again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Beth, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to our FY15 First Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Katharine Kenny, you may begin your conference. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, Beth. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today as Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me as usual remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance, are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014, which is filed with the SEC. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me mention a new addition to CarMax\u2019s Investor Relations website. As of today, we have added a significant amount of historical quarterly information to the Financial Report section of the website that we hope will assist you in your understanding of the company and in developing your models. We will update that with also some information about cash on a quarterly basis sometime in the next two weeks. We would welcome any feedback on this additional information. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The first quarter was a terrific one for CarMax. Total revenues grew 13% to nearly $4 billion, net earnings up 16% to $169 million and earnings per share up 19% to $0.76. Key drivers for the quarter, used unit comps increased by a little over 3% and total used units rose by nearly 10%. Our ASP was a little over 20,000 for the first time ever, largely due to stronger prices we observed in the wholesale market and as evidenced by our relatively flat per unit margins. Total wholesale units grew by 10% and gross profit per vehicle unit -- gross profit per Wholesale unit grew by 7% or $67. Other sales and revenues increased 13% year-over-year due to a $9 million improvement in third-party finance fees; CAF income up 9% to approximately $95 million. I'll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to talk about finance. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter CAF income grew 9% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and average managed receivables grew 20% to $7.4 billion. CAF weighted average contract rate, the rate charged to customers was 7.2% versus 7.0% in last year's first quarter. This rate continues to be relatively stable at around 7% for the past six quarters. The allowance for loan losses grew to $75 million. This represents 1% of managed receivables which is consistent with last year. Credit losses for the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. And CAF net penetration at 41% was relatively flat compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.2 billion in line with the growth in the total used unit sales. Customers funded in the subprime space, those for which we have historically paid a discount, represented about 16% of our sales in the first quarter compared with 21% of our sales in last year\u2019s first quarter and approximately one of this -- one point of this was related to CAF test. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 8% to $313 million. On a per unit basis, SG&A declined $39 to $2,047 per unit compared to $2,086 in the first quarter of fiscal \u201814. SG&A on a per unit basis benefited from a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $56. During the first quarter, we opened up four new stores, three in new markets for CarMax in Rochester, Dothan, Alabama and Spokane, Washington, our first store in the Pacific North West and one in our Harrisburg, Pennsylvania market. After the first quarter ended, we also opened a store in Madison, Wisconsin, another new market for CarMax. It\u2019s the first of four stores we plan to open in the second quarter of this year. Our comps for the quarter were driven by our growth in store traffic. Our web traffic also continued to expand significantly for the quarter. Average monthly web visits grew to over 14 million, up 25% compared to the same period last year. Visits to our mobile site represented approximately 30% of total visits while visit utilizing our mobile app represented another 13% of the total. And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Hi. It\u2019s Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Good morning. Tom Reedy : Hi Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Congratulations on a real nice quarter. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: So I thought, I want to start with a bigger picture question for Tom Folliard and then I had a couple of smaller kind of detailed questions. But the bigger picture question I have, Tom, is if you look at these results today and they were really good. If you look at the business and the environment you\u2019re operating, did something shift positively here in the first quarter of fiscal \u201814 that maybe wasn\u2019t in place through last year. And maybe the other way to ask the question is we think about our models and what we see here in the first quarter. How sustainable are the trends that we saw really throughout the P&L and throughout the divisions of this business? Tom Folliard : First off, Brian, we didn\u2019t do anything different in the quarter. We\u2019re just trying to run a great business and execute better every day and control cost and provide a great customer experience. And I apologize that our business isn\u2019t that predictable and it\u2019s a little difficult to model because we have what I think is a terrific source of profit that are quite diversified. And you see our comps are only up three, four points but over two year, they are up 20. Our wholesale has been a little behind retail for a while but that was up 10 in the quarter. CAF continues to deliver good results but there is nothing structurally different in what we did. Our stores continue to provide a great experience for our customers and they continue to grow. And then we\u2019re opening up stores at a pace that is the fastest pace we\u2019ve ever done before, opening 13 stores this year, another 13 -- I mean 13 last year and another 13 scheduled for this year. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re just doing the things that we said we\u2019re going to do. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Got it. And then some of these more detailed question. We\u2019ve looked at the subprime penetration which is something around 16% this year -- I'm sorry this quarter, down from over 20% same quarter last year. I know you don\u2019t manage towards this but how should we think about subprime penetration going forward? Tom Folliard : We don\u2019t have to think about going forward. It\u2019s largely the result of the credit flow through our stores. We\u2019ve always talked about the fact that we want to make sure our customers have access to credit at all kinds of different scales of credit. And if you look at our applicant flow, we\u2019re still at 90% of our applicants are getting approval of some kind. We told you last year at this time that our subprime providers had got a little more aggressive. We told you in the third quarter that they had pulled back a little bit. And so it makes sense. It was 21% last year when we thought people would be a little bit more aggressive and we saw a little pull back. We were flat in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re slightly down in this quarter. It\u2019s not that surprising based on what we have told everybody. But in terms of where it comes out long term, it\u2019s not really within our control. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Got it. And then the final question. On the wholesale, gross profit for wholesale vehicle, that popped up more and was there something funny there or was that somewhat reflective of the overall environment too? Tom Folliard : I think that there has been, there is some -- if you look at all of the external data on appreciation, there was some slightly higher appreciation during the quarter. That\u2019s always going to benefit our buy rate a little bit and it always going to benefit our margin. So that\u2019s the one that -- I think it\u2019s only the second time, we\u2019ve been over $1000. I didn\u2019t think it was sustainable before and I don\u2019t think it is now. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Got it. Well, thanks and congrats. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia, William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair : Hi. Good morning. So just two questions. I guess, first on the wholesale business because that was a really big surprise on the quarter how well that business did. I think it was the best quarter in a year or two in that business. Was it just external dynamics that really contributed to that or wasn\u2019t anything different internally that you were doing that was helping kind of raise the traffic or that buy rate? Tom Folliard : No, not a thing. You know, what I\u2019ve been saying and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m finally right is that I believe over time wholesale and retail will grow at a similar pace. I don\u2019t think there -- they seem to almost never be connected in a quarter. They happen to be this quarter. Both group total sales were -- total retail sales grew at 10%, total wholesale grew at 10%. But if you remember just two or three years ago, we had wholesales sales grow 30% in the first quarter on top of 50% in the first quarter prior. So there is a lot of volatility in that business as well but I still believe over time that retail and wholesale will grow similarly over a long period of time. This quarter they happened to match up. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair : Are you still seeing as the market ages the wholesale business pick up as people become more familiar with that option at CarMax. And I was wondering, I guess, if the national advertising that you do now, if you focus at all about we\u2019ll buy your car and if that might help around the edges? Tom Folliard : We\u2019ve always had a piece of our advertising around we\u2019ll buy your car, it wasn\u2019t -- we did not change it in the quarter. So there was nothing different about the way we advertised or approached the business this quarter. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair : Okay. Thank you. Tom Folliard : So you know it came out the way it did. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair : All right. Thanks. Tom Folliard : Thanks Sharon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. Your line is open. Liz Suzuki - Bank of America : Good morning. This is Liz Suzuki on for John. The $39 per vehicle reduction in SG&A this quarter was pretty impressive. What were the major components of that cost reduction and can we expect that kind of improvement going forward? Tom Folliard : Well, $56 of the $39 came from stock-based compensation expense. So that\u2019s not necessarily a good guy. And I think a 3-ish percent comps we wouldn\u2019t expect to get leverage like this. So if not for stock-based compensation expense change, I mean, reduction of $56, we would not have leveraged. Liz Suzuki - Bank of America : Got it. Okay. Tom Folliard : We need mid-to-high single digits if we\u2019re in a growth phase to leverage. And we still believe that. Liz Suzuki - Bank of America : Got it. And would you categorize the lower subprime penetration rate this quarter as being driven more from the supply side or the demand side. I mean, in other words, are your lenders pulling back a little bit or are you seeing fewer subprime customers coming in? Tom Reedy : It was a question on Tier 3 or on cap. I\u2019m sorry. Tom Folliard : It was on subprime. Tom Reedy : No, I think it\u2019s -- we need to take step back and think about it, subprime penetration is going to be a combination of factors driving it. One is the credit coming through the door and then another is the behavior of the other lenders in the system. And over time we worked to try to build, as Tom mentioned, a broad spectrum of lenders so that customers have access to credit and I think we are very happy with the partners we have today. We\u2019ve got nothing but praise for them. You look at cash penetration, it was flat. Subprime was down a little bit. We did see a lift in sales that were funded by sources outside of our system. We did see a lift in sales funded by our Tier 2 partners which means they stepped up and took some customers that they may have declined in the past. So Tier 3 behavior is going to be a combination of what\u2019s coming through the door and what makes it down to them, and finally their behavior and their credit appetite. Tom Reedy : And then our stores ability to convert ones we have approvals to work with and the higher, the better the quality of approval, in other words lower the down payment, the better chance we have a conversion. So I would expect over time those things are going to be constantly moving as lenders continue to tweak their scorecard and make adjustments based on the performance of the portfolio that they have originated. Just like it\u2019s been going on for the last the whole time we\u2019ve got in business. Liz Suzuki - Bank of America : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli, RBC. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC: So she got Ciccarelli but missed Nagel, interesting. Couple of questions, guys. First of all, Tom Reedy, can you give a little bit more color about your commentary regarding vehicles funded outside your system? Do you have any feel for kind of what kind of credit tiering that\u2019s on? Or is that just, you just suspect that you\u2019re still 90% plus that your subprime penetration was down? Tom Reedy : No, Scot, we\u2019ve historically said 20% to 25% of our business is going to get done outside of the system. That typically means credit unions or customers who have good access to financing elsewhere or cash. And then, we\u2019ve said that cash is going to run somewhere in the low-40s and the remainder it would be split between our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners. That\u2019s moved around. This year Tier 2 -- this quarter Tier 2 was a bit higher than Tier 3. Last year Tier 3 was higher, but the year before Tier 2 was high. So it just depends what\u2019s come through the door and what\u2019s going on with the individual lenders and their credit appetite at the time. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC: Okay. Understood. And then, since I have you on the line here, with the latest securitization, Tom, it looks like losses per receivable were up quite a bit in the last three months and it basically looks like recoveries had declined, but that seems odd given the fact that wholesale pricing was so strong. Do you have any more detail or reasoning as to why the numbers look shaking out the way they did? Tom Reedy : Not, at this point, Scot. I mean, it\u2019s early into that deal, so I think you need to let it incubate for a little while, but we can follow up with you afterwards on if you want more - need to dig in more detail. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC: Understood. And the last question for Tom Folliard. Tom, why do you think wholesale pricing was so strong? I mean, should we be on more of a normal depreciation curve at this point as kind of that lack of supply has been filled in over the last couple of years? I just find it\u2019s surprising that even at the Manheim level, we\u2019ve seen prices rising, which just seems counterintuitive? Tom Folliard : Well, in the spring, if this was what we would say a normal year, we would see some appreciation in the spring and then kind of a steady decline throughout the rest of the year. And this year, we saw more appreciation in the spring than we are used to. And lots of people attributed to weather and pent-up demand for inventory. So we will go with that. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC: I understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison, Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison - Baird: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on your web traffic, I think you said it was up 25%. Would love to hear what is driving the strong growth in that metric? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s a measure of traffic, that\u2019s continued to grow kind of around that pace for several years now. I think there\u2019s a number of different factors. First and foremost, I think we have a great website. I think we have a great search engine. I think we\u2019ve done a really nice job of making sure that when customers are on our site, whether it\u2019s through mobile or desktop or touchscreen that they have a good experience. So I think there is that. Clearly, the Internet is becoming bigger and bigger every single year as a source of information. So I think customers just naturally are going to go to the web first. We continue to expand our geographic footprint. So we are in more markets. So we are going to get some growth there as well. Remember, that\u2019s not comp, that\u2019s just total traffic. So as we grow the company and we add more stores and we sell more cars and we get more -- kind of more CarMax sports people on the road, I would expect that number to continue to rise as well. So I don\u2019t know if any one thing, I think it\u2019s a number of different things. Craig Kennison - Baird: I am curious whether you can analyze any of the traffic you\u2019re getting to improve where you choose to locate stores, for example if you get a lot of traffic, it matters to Wisconsin. Is that a helpful metric as you decide in your next store? Tom Folliard : Well, it hasn\u2019t, I mean at this point we think the CarMax consumer offer works in just about any market in the U.S. and we are very excited to go to the places that we\u2019re not, but we are also very excited to continue to add stores in the places where we are. And we haven\u2019t seen that web traffic by a particular locale is an indicative of where we should build the next store. We really want to go build our stores where people are, because then they need cars and then they are buying from us. Craig Kennison - Baird: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question, thinking about wholesale and the upside that you showed there. The pricing would explain the profitability, the units in the sense were really what took off most dramatically from the trend whether you compare to the prior couple of quarters, if you look at it as a percent relative to the sales of used cars. What kind of visibility do you think you have given the trends that we saw, the wholesale volume is going for? Do you think the volume piece of that could be sustainable? Tom Folliard : Like I said, earlier, Matt, I think that wholesale volumes and retail volumes over a very long period of time will grow about the same. They seem to never be connected. They happen to be connected this time. If you think about the variables that go into that deliver a wholesale volume for us as how many customers show up at the store? Of those customers, how many get their car praised? Of the ones who get their car praised, who many sales a car? If all of those things were flat year-over-year, we should have gone up 10% because our sales went up 10%, so -- but they are never always flat. There is always movement in some of those variables. We had a strong buyer rate, a little over 30%, slightly up compared to the year prior and with total sales being up 10% and that been driven by foot traffic. It\u2019s time to come out the way you would think it would come out. But as I said, it\u2019s just on a quarter by quarter basis, these two things are never exactly connected. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Got it. A quick follow-up. The stock-based comp piece, can you talk about how chunky that tends to be, in other words is that an item that is more typically for Q1 based on options timing or is this something that can be volatile as it was during Q1 and throughout the year? Tom Reedy : Matt, it\u2019s really going to be driven of stock price. So last year in Q1, we saw stock price appreciate, this year and do so well. There is a -- we have outstanding equity grants to folks that we have to account for based on changes in stock prices and that\u2019s really who is going to drive it. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : But you would view this as sort of an outlier move in one direction or the other, it sounds like? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s just something we are going to adjust on a regular basis based on the stock price. Street, it\u2019s pretty much street, Matt. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Understood. But, is this one of the bigger moves you\u2019ve seen in that number that you called that up? Tom Folliard : No, I mean, we\u2019ve seen it go the other direction as well. Tom Reedy : Yes. Matt, we called it out mostly because it was a little distortive of our ability to leverage SG&A. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Tom Reedy : We really want to talk that. We want to get credit for leverage on SG&A on something that\u2019s not really under our control. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Understood. And then finally if you think about the supply of vehicles at auction and the sources thereof, are you seeing the new vehicle hit in a way that you can get access to them? Tom Folliard : We\u2019ve seen a few movements in our percent of sales in the first quarter by a few points over to 0 to 4 from 5 to 10 but only by 2 or 3 points, so wasn\u2019t significant. I have been saying all along I expect that supply to come back. We have historically done really well in that segment of inventory and I expect us to do well again. But overall, there wasn\u2019t a ton of movement. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Is that the biggest move you\u2019ve seen in this cycle so far, that incremental creep? Tom Folliard : Yeah, two or three points, yeah, I think over the last several quarters it\u2019s been pretty flat, so yes. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you so much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham, Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Good morning. It\u2019s Seth Basham. First question for you is on third-party subprime penetration. You guys have talked about one lender pulling back in the past. Have you seen any of your other lending partners start to pull back? Tom Folliard : No, I don\u2019t recall talking about one lender specific in the past. And I will say that we\u2019ve observed across the board in our portfolio, a bit of a tightening in terms from our lenders. We look at the sales applications rate of ourselves of all of our partners and we\u2019ve seen that dial back a little bit for the quarter. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Got you. Okay. And as it relates to your own subprime test, it seems to be ramping a little bit more quickly than I anticipated. You guys still planning to complete that at the end of the year or is that ahead of schedule? Tom Reedy : I say it\u2019s on track. We said we\u2019ve done about $30 million to date and really nothing specific to report yet. Yes, it is going to take us getting a critical mass of receivables and watching those incubate for a while before we have anything to start reporting on it. But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the volume today. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : And was there any impact at all on your CAF results from the additional subprime loans that you guys issued? Tom Reedy : Not on the results. I mean, at this point it\u2019s little early in the process with the subprime and the expected losses are still high. It\u2019s actually a little bit of a drag on CAF earnings but it\u2019s nothing material. We have to reserve 12 months of losses out the gate as we originate those loans. And with those loans having a higher expected loss rate than our regular portfolio until we start building up a critical mass, it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit of a drag on our earnings but it\u2019s very minimal and nothing to report. And as we go forward, it may have some impact on the loss provision, our average contract rate and the overall allowance. And to the extent, it does become something that merits calling out. We\u2019ll give you that color. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Are you being extra conservative in terms to your loss provisions on the new subprime loans without the history yet? Tom Reedy : We\u2019re being -- we believe appropriately conservative. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay. And then on the wholesale, buy rate being up, that\u2019s good. But what about the mix of cars that you guys are buying? Have you seen the mix shift back towards older cars or you still seeing that mix shift towards new or late model cars? Tom Folliard : Well, wholesale is all stuff that doesn\u2019t meet our retail standard. So the mix of that product has been pretty much the same and the mix of retail, I talked about earlier, couple of points of movement but not really too much. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : No, I\u2019m just thinking about the cars you\u2019re buying from the appraisal lanes. Are you seeing a mix shift between newer used cars and older used cars? Tom Folliard : No. And remember the cars we buy in the appraisal lane, a whole bunch of them we sell at retail and then the rest go to wholesale so. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay. And then lastly on the ASPs, obviously very strong this quarter. Were you guys anticipating the strength in the ASPs wholesale car prices this quarter to be a strong as they were? If not, how did that benefit your retail business? Tom Folliard : No. And I never like prices going up. I rather have prices go down, although I don\u2019t think they will. So it\u2019s a first time we have been over $20,000 average retail, since we started the business. But our margins per car were flat. So it was clearly a reflection of what the market was doing. And we talked about wholesale pricing being up during the quarter and it was simply that. And really, the only benefit from higher ASP is we get a little more on the spread when we do a CAF loan but other than that I rather see us provide lower prices to customers. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : All right. Okay. If I could sneak one last one in, the recovery rate on\u2026 Tom Folliard : We have got to move on there, Seth. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay. No problem. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine, Stifel. Your line is open. James Albertine - Stifel: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the solid quarter. So really quickly on just the small store formats, just a quick update there. Are there any plans within the store count openings that you suggested to incrementally add some small store formats? And then separately, I guess related, anything that you\u2019re learning from those initiative that you maybe help glean to more efficient super store model? Tom Folliard : So we have three small formats stores open, only one has been open for than a year, so there\u2019s very little of anything to report. Other than we have some processes that needed to take place in order for those stores to work just from an operational standpoint and they\u2019re working very well. They have very small inventory. We have to move cars a little bit quicker. We have cross train lots of our employees in those stores to be able to do multiple tasks and that stuffs all working really great. We don\u2019t really have any results to report, because we just don\u2019t have enough time under our belt with only three stores open. In this year\u2019s growth plan, we have two more those planned, one in Lynchburg, Virginia and one in Tupelo, Mississippi. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to get five of these open and read the results for a little while. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand. I think there will be some learnings over time with some of the stuff I just mentioned, cross-training of people and maybe the ability to run a store little bit more efficiently, but we\u2019re long ways away from that. James Albertine - Stifel: Great. Thank you very much. And then a quick clarification on the website, the benefits of the increase in web traffic over time, are there any transactional benefits or you precluded from transacting still online to a degree based on state by state regulations? Tom Folliard : We don\u2019t fully transact online. There isn\u2019t really a preclusion. If we wanted to really press down that path, we could. We found that customers want to test drive cars. They want to -- particularly, our average cars is almost four years old, with almost 40,000 miles on it. We\u2019ve been adding more and more capabilities for customers to do from home and they\u2019ve been taking advantage of that and we\u2019re very pleased with that so far. But in the last six months we now allow our customers to put cars on hold and make appointments online without speaking to anybody. We still have the capability in the number of stores for customers to transfer cars, even a pay transfer by giving their credit card online without speaking to anybody and having that car delivered. They can actually start their paper work online, making appointment for the sales consultant and show up a lot of the work already done. But in terms of fully consummating the deal online, we\u2019re not doing that yet. James Albertine - Stifel: Great. Thanks and good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson, Stephens. Your line is now open. Rick Nelson - Stephens: Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s Stephens. Can you -- comps store traffic, could you see a meaningful acceleration there this quarter? Tom Folliard : Well, we said our comps were due to store traffic. Our comps were a little over three. I think of traffic and conversion, like I\u2019ve mentioned wholesale earlier. I think over time that our comps will be driven partly by traffic and partly by execution increases or conversion increases. What happened over the last several years is we\u2019ve had few quarters where all of our sales increase was driven by conversion and we\u2019ve had sometimes where all of it has been driven by traffic. There were times when it was about a 50-50 split and I think over a long period of time, that\u2019s kind of what we expect. It\u2019s just so happened this quarter that our conversion was relatively flat and our comps were driven by traffic. Rick Nelson - Stephens: Okay. And do you think you are getting any kind of benefits from the snowstorms that the business shifting from the fourth quarter to that March and May timeframe? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s a really difficult thing for us to measure. We\u2019ve never really made a big deal out of weather. I think because we are an in infrequent purchase that we don\u2019t view that we lose. We\u2019re not like a grocery business where if you don\u2019t sell milk, then you never get to sell that milk. We sell a car. People buy it once every five years and what we\u2019ve seen in our history is, if we miss some sales then we kind of get them back overtime. But it\u2019s really hard to measure. So, I wouldn\u2019t attribute anything. We didn\u2019t attribute anything in the fourth quarter to it and we don\u2019t attribute anything in this quarter to it. Rick Nelson - Stephens: Yeah. And I know you don\u2019t like to discuss weather as an issue, but thanks very much and good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston, Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston - Morningstar: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to, I guess, two longer term questions. Can you give any color on what -- with your cash continuing to grow so well and you are doing the share buybacks? Can you disclose a minimum cash levels to run the business either in dollar terms or as a percentage of revenue? Tom Reedy : We are not -- I don\u2019t think we are going to talk about it in dollar terms as a percent of revenue. But we look at it more as minimum amount of liquidity to make sure that we have ample liquidity to keep inventory in our stores to keep CAF funded in the short-term period between securitization, et cetera. We are very comfortable with our levels today. Tom Folliard : And to build stores. Tom Reedy : And obviously to build stores and I don\u2019t think there is anything we can really talk about as far as minimum. I would say that we are comfortable moving to a position of more leverage than we have today in the current capital structure. When you see we are doing stock buyback program and I want to extrapolate from there, but that, you have seen us before having significantly more depth than we have today and we are not uncomfortable with the level that\u2019s higher than today. David Whiston - Morningstar: Okay. And then what, hopefully, the very long-term question is what are you doing over the next year or so and today strategically in your planning to protect profits for the inevitable next recession? Tom Folliard : I mean, we are just running the business and trying to get more and more efficient each and everyday. I think, we learned a lot during the last recession. We significantly improved our profitability and our execution and because of those learnings, we have been hyper focused on not losing that momentum. So I think, our store teams are doing a fantastic job of controlling cost and trying to be more and more efficient with the customer, where we have proven to be pretty good at managing inventory across a very short timeframe and I feel very confident that we were not just sitting still in that regard, we are actually better at it than we were couple a year ago. So I feel like working on what we do everyday and trying to get better at each of those things is the best defense against the recession. David Whiston - Morningstar: Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Knight, Tiger Management. Your line is open. Alex Knight - Tiger Management : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. You\u2019ve said in the past that one of the main limitations on your expansion is the number of associates you can train? Can you give us some color on ease of finding and training associates for the new stores and any progress you are making there? Tom Folliard : Sure. We feel pretty good about where we are right now. We are, as I mentioned, although, our pace of store growth, 13 stores last year and 13 stores this year, is the most number of stores we have opened. As a percentage of our total store base, we have been much more aggressive at two different periods in the past. And I think we learned that those were little bit too fast in terms of being able to higher train, develop and have people ready to not just open new stores but to replace people in stores that they vacated. So at this pace right now we are very analytical about how we do it. We look at each position in the store. We factor in turnover levels. We try to hire people in advance. We try to hire people regionally, if we know we have store openings coming for example in California, we are going to try to staff up in stores that are closed and I feel like we have a great group of people working on that and a pretty good training program. But again, it\u2019s something we are not satisfied with and we want to get better at everyday and we are focused on that. But right now we feel in very good shape to open up the stores that we have planned. Alex Knight - Tiger Management : All right. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong, CL King & Associates. Your line is open. Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates: Good morning. Just getting back to the average selling price, I know you talked about higher overall levels of pricing? But also to what extent might that have been influenced by mix, particularly since you had a lower sub-prime penetration in the sales mix during the quarter? Tom Reedy : Yeah. I never think about mix of inventory based on levels of credit. I think mix of inventory based on the actual cars that we sold and there was, I mentioned, there was a slight movement towards, we said, zero to four-year old cars for a while now have been 70% of sales and five to 10-year old cars have been 30% of sales, and remember that number of, I am sorry, of five to 10-year old cars used to be 15% a long time ago and it doubled. And then we have seen that stay relatively flat for a number of years and then this quarter we saw couple of points movement. So I would say that had a little impact on the ASP but I am not sure to what extent. And I don\u2019t know what our ASP was the quarter before, was it 19.5, somebody know. Katharine Kenny : Yes. Tom Reedy : 19.4, 5, so it\u2019s up a few hundred bucks. Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates: Yeah. And at the auctions, we hearing a lot of off-lease vehicles coming to the auctions that obviously relatively new cars three years old on average? Are you seeing more availability of those types of cars when you are looking for inventory at auctions, whether it\u2019s Manheim, Odessa, et cetera? Tom Folliard : Yeah. We are always, depending on what the lease rate was, two years ago and three years ago, we have very high lease rate right now, then you see those cars back at the auction. The truth is, you always see those cars back at the auction in shape or form, but if they were leased then they come back in more of an organized lane. But it is largely driven by consumer behavior not just people who lease cars, but people who buy cars and how quickly do they then trade those cars in and we have seen this -- we have kind of seen this act before with leases as a percent of total retail sales. I would say being as low as 12% or 13% and as high as 30%. But that\u2019s a cycle, that happen, that goes up and down over the last 20 years multiple times and we have never had a problem accessing inventory. Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates: Got it. Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned a modest reduction ESP penetration rate, anything to call out there? Tom Folliard : No. Nothing really, we mentioned last quarter that our partners were making some pricing adjustments. We make pricing adjustments on that product all the time based on the performance of their portfolio. Remember that\u2019s two different third parties that do our extended service plans and they manage their business to be profitable. So we had some price changes. We saw a little decline in penetration. Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates: Okay. Great. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thanks. I am back. Tom Folliard : Hi, Matt. Tom Reedy : Okay. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Two very quick follow-ups, first of all, could you talk about your self-sufficiency ratio just year-on-year how it looked? Tom Folliard : I didn\u2019t, but it was around 46%, 47%, it was flattish year-over-year. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : 46%, 47%. Thank you. And then secondly, obviously, we recently saw an IPO from the company called TrueCar, is that, I know has focused on price transparency to the new dealer, to the new car channel, working hand-in-hand with dealers it seems, but also has a product for used cars, interested on your perspective on some of these tools? I guess, this one in particular, because of its profile, whether you see this is an emerging trend and what your best sense is of how to deal with that? Tom Folliard : Nobody is more transparent than us with pricing and we have never really had to use the third-party to show customers what a great offer we have at CarMax. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : And is it putting any pressure on the market that you see or really no impact? Tom Folliard : Nothing that we have seen. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Matt. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. We turn the call back to our presenters. Tom Folliard : All right. Thank you very much. Thanks everyone for joining us and most of all thanks to all of our associates for all you do everyday and we will see you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Thanks. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. In the second quarter, total revenues grew 11% to $3.6 billion, net earnings grew 10% to $155 million, and earnings per share increased by 13% to $0.70 per share. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.06 related to the receipt of the Toyota legal settlement proceeds. In terms of other key drivers for the quarter, used unit comps increased slightly for the quarter and total used units rose by over 6%. Gross profit per used unit remained flat compared to last year at $21.73. Total wholesale units grew by over 7% and gross profit per wholesale unit expanded by 3% or $25. Other sales and revenue increased 11% year-over-year due to an $8.5 million improvement in third party finance fees, and CAF income grew 10% to approximately $93 million. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to discuss finance. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. Overall, the CAF story is not too different from what we discussed in Q1. In the second quarter, CAF income grew 10% compared to the second quarter of FY14, and average managed receivables grew 19% to $7.7 billion. CAF weighted average contract rate \u2013 the rate charged to customers \u2013 was 7% versus 6.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This rate has been relatively stable at around 7% for the past several quarters. The allowance for loan losses grew to $78 million. This represents 1% of average managed receivables, which is consistent with last year. As we saw earlier in the year, credit losses for the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. CAF net penetration at 41% was relatively flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, and net loans originated in the quarter rose 7% to $1.2 billion. That\u2019s in line with the total growth in unit sales. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 5% to $298 million. Excluding the legal settlement gain, SG&A expenses increased 13% primarily due to the addition of 18 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and a $6.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis excluding the legal settlement gain, SG&A increased $116 to $2,183 compared to $2,067 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. During the second quarter, we opened four stores, three in new markets for us : Madison, Wisconsin, Lynchburg, Virginia, and Portland, Oregon, and one in our existing Dallas market. Store traffic was up modestly in the quarter and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the quarter, average monthly web visits grew to nearly 14 million, up 15% compared to the same period last year. Visitors to our mobile site continue to represent approximately 30% of total visits while visits utilizing our mobile apps represented another 15% of the total. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer. Your line is open. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo : Good morning everyone. Tom Folliard : Hey Matt. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo : So just quickly on SG&A expense, should we expect\u2014you\u2019ve got fewer stores opening in the back half. Should we expect that the growth rate in SG&A could go back to the single digits or do you think we\u2019ll stay at this elevated level for the rest of the year? Tom Folliard : I\u2019m not sure, Matt. We deleveraged in the quarter, but that was largely due to a relatively low comp. I\u2019m not sure of the timing of openings during the rest of the year, but it was definitely impacted by a heavy weight of newer stores in the quarter. Tom Reedy : Yeah, we had a heavy weight of new stores at the end of last year and early this year, so it\u2019s definitely the most effective new locations we\u2019ve had in recent history. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, and then secondly, could you just talk to the reasons behind the lower EPP penetration and the higher cancel rates? Any change in the program that\u2019s causing that? Tom Folliard : The changes in the program, we discussed at the end of the year when we talked about having to make adjustments for the reserve, so we had some price changes and we saw some impact in penetration, but we\u2019ve had price changes several times over the last 20 years that we\u2019ve been doing this, and occasionally it has a little bit bigger of an impact. It\u2019s still a very strong ESP penetration for the quarter, and EPP is a combination of both ESP and GAP, both of which had price changes since the last time we talked. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo : Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson. Your line is open. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two things \u2013 one, can you give us some color on the subprime? I know it was down as a percent, but can you tell us kind of where the non-subprime creditors, like this Exeter and others, fit into the mix, and if you were to look at your prime business only, what kind of comps you might have kind of seen in prime only. Tom Reedy : Yeah, it\u2019s very hard to pull that all apart, and we\u2019re not in a position to talk about how much specific headwind Tier 3 was. As you saw, it was down about five points year-over-year as a percent of our sales, which is consistent with last year; but we need to remember that Tier 3 is not only impacted by their behavior but by what\u2019s going on above them and what\u2019s coming through the door. Over time, we\u2019ve seen the mix of Tier 2 to Tier 3 change \u2013 you know, two years ago Tier 2 was a bigger percentage of sales, last year Tier 3 was bigger. This year, we\u2019ve seen Tier 2 pick up somewhat, so they\u2019ve been picking up some of the penetration that Tier 3 lost, but it\u2019s difficult to discern exactly how that translates through the comps because Tier 3\u2019s behavior is also a byproduct of what they\u2019re seeing and what they\u2019re experiencing in their portfolio. Tom Folliard : If you remember, our water flow of assets starts with CAF and goes on to Tier 2, and from there to Tier 3, so Tier 3 doesn\u2019t see any of the applications that are approved and booked by anything above them. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Tom Folliard : And this change in percent of sales is similar to the change we saw in the first quarter. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : Can you just tell us, is there any reason to think as the back half your comparisons get easier \u2013 they go from 16% down to 10% and then 7%. Is there any reason to think that the sales trend wouldn\u2019t improve commensurate with that? Tom Folliard : Yeah, we don\u2019t give any forward-looking guidance. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : All right, I was asking for it a little differently, but I appreciate that. Have a good day. Tom Folliard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning. I wanted to maybe ask the subprime question a little bit differently, but if we look at\u2014like you just mentioned in response to the prior question, you\u2019ve had now a couple quarters with a pretty significant decline in subprime as a percentage of total sales. But does that reflect\u2014as we think about what\u2019s happening behind that, is that just simply a mix shift, or are you seeing further tightening, if you will, on the part of your partners? Then the follow-up question on that, and I think you mentioned it briefly in your press release, but maybe just some update on your own subprime test and how that\u2019s going, and what we should expect going forward. Tom Reedy : Sure, I can comment a little bit on that. The Tier 3, as I said, it\u2019s a combination of factors. We\u2019re clearly seeing them continue to provide, I\u2019ll say less attractive offers than they were a year ago, less compelling offers for the customer so therefore we\u2019re seeing less conversion in that space. But as I mentioned, it\u2019s a byproduct of their behavior plus what they\u2019re seeing coming through the door, and we\u2019ve seen some pickup in the behavior of our other partner lenders. With regard to our Tier 3 experiment, we\u2019re still early into it \u2013 we just started. I think the first wave of originations is just starting to anniversary six months, so we\u2019re really not in a position to talk about how that\u2019s going yet, and we\u2019ll have an update for you as soon as something makes sense to talk about. But it\u2019s on track, we\u2019re expecting to continue to do it throughout the year and get through the test as we announced it. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: So if I could just follow up, and not to get too cute with this, but we\u2019ve been talking a lot about subprime and CarMax, and there was a point last year where you really called out your partners, you know, for one reason or another seemingly getting\u2014well, pulling back some of the business. So you commented again about year-on-year, but if we look at it maybe not year-on-year but Q2 versus Q1, is there still a further pull back or has it stayed about the same? Tom Reedy : I wouldn\u2019t know specifically. I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing the same type of trend as we did in Q1. Remember, we first talked about this at the very end of\u2014we saw it happening at the very end of Q3. There was a notable shift in behavior. I think\u2014you know, we have no reason to think behavior is changing from where it is today. We want those guys to run a profitable business that\u2019s going to be sustainable and support our customers for the long run. They are going to test and make changes as appropriate for their portfolio, and we wish them all the best of luck in doing it. As far as Q1 to Q2, though, I would say it\u2019s more of a continuation of the same. We\u2019re seeing less attractive offers than a year ago being presented to the customer, and therefore less take-up on the Tier 3. Tom Folliard : It\u2019s a similar drop-off, Brian, in points of sale \u2013 about five points in the first quarter, five points in the second quarter. It still represents 15% of our sales, it\u2019s still business that we\u2019re really happy to do, and really happy to have a credit offer that reaches all kinds of different customers. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open. Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America : Good morning, this is Liz Suzuki on for John. It looks like comps were a little lower than what we expected, even adjusting for the lost Saturday. Do you think consumers are substituting new vehicles for used, given the attractive financing rates available, and are you seeing more competition from new vehicle dealers, particularly on a monthly payment basis? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s really hard to tell the reasons why somebody would buy new over used. I think it\u2019s good for us when we see the SAAR continuing to grow, as we\u2019ve talked about. Over time, I think it will have long-term benefits for us, both on the supply side and the fact that consumers are more willing to get out there and sign up for a loan and buy a car. As far as our comps are concerned, I don\u2019t really view it as very much different from the first quarter. It was three points in the first quarter. If you add back a point for Saturday, we\u2019re really just not that far off. I\u2019m really pleased with the way the quarter turned out. It\u2019s the most cars we\u2019ve ever sold. Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America : Great, thanks. Just one follow-up, which is do you have what the typical monthly payment amount is for a CarMax customer? Tom Folliard : I don\u2019t think we do off the top of our heads, but it\u2019s $20,000 average sale price, it\u2019s 90 or 95%. Tom Reedy : We\u2019ll get back to you. Tom Folliard : Yeah, we can get back to you on that. I\u2019m not sure. Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America : All right, thank you. Tom Folliard : You can back into it with our contract rate from CAF, but then you\u2019d have to go all the way down the credit tier as well, so. Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America : All right, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot, good morning. My primary question here relates to SG&A. We saw some volatility, I guess, in the year-on-year trends, particularly for compensation and benefits per vehicle retail. I know that\u2019s the biggest line item in SG&A. It was down a chunk year-on-year in the first quarter, up a chunk year-on-year in the second quarter, kind of nets out to kind of flattish year-on-year. Anything significant driving that volatility, and how would you think about\u2014which quarter would you say is more representative of the trend you\u2019d expect to see going forward? Tom Reedy : Hey Matt, it\u2019s Tom Reedy. If you look at that, and I think if you remember last quarter, we noted that stock-based comp was favorable in the quarter and didn\u2019t want to take any credit for it. This quarter, it went back the other way because the stock price went up, and I think you\u2019re right to look at it in kind of a year-to-date basis rather than a quarter-to-quarter, because that piece has been quite volatile. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Understood, okay. Secondly, just a follow-up on some of the questions that you\u2019ve already gotten on subprime. Presumably you have a long range view about where subprime essentially lands. Historically it\u2019s been as low as mid-single digits and obviously as high more recently as the low 20\u2019s. When all is said and done, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re modeling the business out by source of finance, or at least have some sense of where you\u2019d expect it to be, where do you think this ultimately settles in terms of subprime penetration? Tom Folliard : Matt, we actually don\u2019t model it and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to settle out. As Tom mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a reflection of our partners\u2019 behavior and the credit we have coming through the door. We\u2019re happy to do every one of these deals. We think they\u2019re 100% incremental. Remember \u2013 Tier 3 lenders don\u2019t see an application until it\u2019s declined by every other lender, so it\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s going to come out the way it comes out, and we expect some volatility there but we don\u2019t really have any view into where we expect it to shake out long-term. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush. Your line is open. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : My question revolves around the finance lending program as well. Specifically, can you comment on what the approval rates were this year relative to last? Tom Reedy : Down very slightly, but we\u2019re still seeing over 90% of our customers receiving approval of some kind in our stores. If you remember, as we\u2019ve been talking about the last couple of quarters, the decline in kind of attach on the subprime business is more a byproduct of the nature of the offers that the lenders are providing, whereas in the past a $13,000 loan may have had a $100 or $200 down payment requirement, that number may be several hundred dollars higher today, making it a more difficult transaction for the customer. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of things, but as far as actually receiving an offer, it\u2019s still very strong in our stores and overall we\u2019re very happy with the finance environment. We think we have a great array of lenders for our customers, and customers have great access to financing in the CarMax system. Tom Folliard : Yeah Seth, as Tom said, 90% of customers are getting approval from somebody in our kind of hemisphere of lending, and that number has been\u2014you know, 90 has kind of been as high as it\u2019s ever been for us, but it\u2019s been stable there for a couple of years now. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Got it, understood. So you mentioned that traffic was up a bit or flat, but conversion was down \u2013 a little bit different trend than in recent quarters, I believe. When you think about conversion in credit tier, was there any change in the tiers other than the subprime? Tom Folliard : This quarter was not very much different from last quarter. Whenever we talk about conversion and traffic, my view is that you have to look at both of those things on a much longer term basis than just one quarter, and I\u2019ve always felt like our growth will come partially from growth, but it never seems to match up exactly in a quarter. So like you said, conversion was flattish, traffic was slightly up, but I\u2019m not sure what that says for the quarters going forward. Tom Reedy : CAF was relatively flat as far as penetration for the quarter, and we saw subprime down a few points. We saw an increase in Tier 2 and a smaller increase in the customers that did not need financing in our system. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Understood, and the last follow-up \u2013 just thinking about conversion, is there anything besides credit that might have affected the conversion rate this quarter relative to the last couple quarters? Tom Folliard : No. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next questions comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital : Thank you. Can I just clarify something? So what you outlined for subprime, so the 13.8% penetration, that is purely the Tier 3 providers, and some of the drop-off we saw there was picked up by what you consider Tier 2 providers. Is that the right way to think about that? Tom Reedy : Scot, that number is the Tier 3 providers plus the CAF test, so it\u2019s all customers that would have been funded in that space, including ours, which is a very small portion of it is CAF. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital : Got it \u2013 okay. And then out of the CAF approvals that you have in the regular CAF program, how much of that\u2014I know you guys have your proprietary scorecard, but how much of that would you guys generally consider subprime, because obviously if you go through the securitizations, you\u2019re charging mid-teens interest rates for a lot of people, and I\u2019m assuming those aren\u2019t what you and I would call prime customers. Tom Reedy : No, as we\u2019ve talked about before, Scot, CAF\u2019s (indiscernible) if you want to call it that, is across a broad spectrum of credit, and it\u2019s customers that we\u2019re experienced with in our system, we have a good track record with and we\u2019re able to securitize. I\u2019m very hesitant to define subprime because I think it\u2019s different in the eyes of almost anyone you ask. You can look at the strat tables in our deals and kind of get a feel for it, but\u2014you know, we like every customer we do at CAF. That\u2019s why we\u2019re approving them. Tom Folliard : And as you know, Scot, we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. We\u2019ve done lots of securitizations, and when you look at the aggregate portfolio that we\u2019re originating, it\u2019s delivering a very low loss rate and is very attractive to investors. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital : Right, understood. The last question is inventory was up kind of sharply this quarter \u2013 it was up in 1Q as well. What\u2019s the outlook for that and kind of the right way to think about inventory growth going forward? Thanks a lot, guys. Tom Folliard : Sure, thank you, Scot. Most of inventory growth in the first couple of quarters has been around a combination of new stores that are open and building inventory for new stores that are about to be open. We have some stores that are carrying more inventory than they did last year, and we were a little bit low last year and we had relatively high turns with pretty good comps in the first and second quarter last year. So it\u2019s a combination of we were probably a little behind where we wanted to be last year. We intentionally are a little ahead this year, but it\u2019s mostly driven by either new stores that are open or preparing to open new stores, so we have to buy cars in advance, we have recondition them, we have to have them in process, and in many cases shipping some pretty significant distances to get new stores open, like the last one in Portland. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital : But comfortable with the levels today? Tom Folliard : Yeah, absolutely. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital : Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Stifel. Your line is open. James Albertine \u2013 Stifel: Great, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Wanted to get a sense on an updated view from you guys on the broader supply environment. I think most would expect, given the trail for the new vehicle growth in the market, that perhaps we\u2019re earlier innings in the used supply ramp; and yet, your pricing for the used retail side was up, I think ahead of our expectations. It was pretty considerable, I would think, in the second quarter, so I just wanted to get kind of your idea to maybe diagnose what\u2019s going on from the supply side and what\u2019s driving pricing with respect to what you\u2019re seeing in the market. Thanks. Tom Folliard : Yeah, our average retail was pretty close in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. In terms of supply, the first part for us is looking at self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency was slightly over 50%, so those are the cars that we buy through the appraisaling that then become retail cars for us, but not much of a change from the first quarter. In terms of the new car sales translating to future supply, I think you said it \u2013 we\u2019re in the early innings, and I would agree with you although we\u2019ve seen a nice pick-up in SAAR. The supply kind of trickle down will happen over the next couple of years, so we\u2019re excited about that. We have said in the past that we historically over-perform in kind of two, three, four-year-old cars. That mix of sales for us was slightly up in the quarter but not very much, and so we still think that is yet to come. James Albertine \u2013 Stifel: Just as a quick follow-up, do you think pricing can hold at these levels as supply continues to ramp? Tom Folliard : I don\u2019t really have much of a prediction on that. The only time we\u2019ve ever seen significant drop-off in our average retail was during the recession, when we saw our average retail drop by over $2,000. Other than that, due to inflation and due to just continued increased costs of new cars, a new car now is over $30,000, it\u2019s just not something that I think will go backwards. James Albertine \u2013 Stifel: Appreciate it. Thanks again, and good luck in the third quarter. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : As a reminder, if you do have a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Your line is open. Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates: Good morning, guys. Back to subprime, is it fair to say that the traffic trends or maybe the number of subprime applications was down year-over-year? Tom Reedy : I can say overall through the quarter, we saw credit applications down very slightly. There\u2019s nothing specific to talk about as far as volumes through the door. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much\u2014 Tom Folliard : No, and as Tom said earlier, if you look at our applicant flow, 90% of customers get an approval of some kind from one of the lenders that we provide or that partners with us, but it\u2019s not just an approval, it\u2019s the quality of the approval. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of different things. Everybody has their own scorecard, everybody runs their own business. We do the best we can with the approvals that we get, and our stores, I think, do a fantastic job of trying to help customers get through whatever challenges that they may have, whether it\u2019s on the credit side or the trade-in side. We\u2019re really proud of the offers that we have for our consumers from top to bottom in the credit tiers. Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates: Okay, and then just one quick one \u2013 the EPP estimated cancellation reserve rates, was that something material, and would we see more of that going forward? Tom Reedy : No, if you remember earlier in the\u2014or at the end of last year, we adjusted the rates at which we reserve on both ESP and the GAP product. This year, part of the reason that we are seeing increased costs, or a lower amount of revenue margin in those products, is that we are reserving at that higher rate. As far as\u2014there\u2019s no major adjustments embedded in that, but we are reserving at a higher rate than we were a year ago, and have been all this year. Tom Folliard : Yeah, and remember \u2013 whenever we reserve at a higher rate, that\u2019s the rate we think we should be reserving at, so we have it set for what our best prediction is of what\u2019s going to happen with returns going forward, both on the ESP side and on the GAP insurance side. Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates: Okay, and then could you just remind us when we will anniversary that higher reserve rate that you\u2019ve put in place? Tom Reedy : Q1 of next year. Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates: Q1 \u2013 okay, got it. Okay, thank you. Tom Folliard : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar: Thanks. Good morning. Any detail you can give on the quarter relative to prior year quarter on traffic and the conversion rate? Tom Folliard : We said traffic was up modestly and conversion was flattish. David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar: Okay, thanks. Then more a strategic question \u2013 are you guys considering or actually doing basically a substitute for Craigslist for private sale where two customers could buy a used vehicle at a CarMax store with a CarMax inspection done for a fee? Tom Folliard : No. I\u2019m not sure what you mean there, but no, we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re only selling cars that we own. David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar: Okay, thank you. Tom Folliard : All right. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Tom Folliard : All right, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interested in CarMax, and of course thanks to all of our associates for all you do every day, and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

If you\u2019re interested in attending, please let us know. As always, I hope you remember to ask just one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue. Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Folliard : Thanks Katharine. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw, we had a great third quarter. Total revenues grew 16% to $3.4 billion, net earnings grew 22% to $130 million, and earnings per share have increased almost 28% to $0.60. Used unit comps grew by 7.4% for the quarter and total used units rose by 14%. Gross profit per used unit increased $23 compared to last year to $2,172. Total wholesale units were up 10% and gross profit per wholesale unit was up $40 to $927. Other sales and revenue rose by over 30% partially due to an increase of $13 million in extended protection plan revenues. This expansion reflected the growth in unit sales offset by a somewhat lower penetration rate. Also impacting October sales and revenues growth was a $2.5 million improvement in third party finance fees. CAF income grew 7% to approximately $90 million, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to give you some more details. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. In Q3, CAF income grew 7% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and average managed receivables grew 18% to $8 billion. CAF weighted average contract rate - that\u2019s the rate charged to customers - was flat to last year\u2019s third quarter at 7%, and this rate has been relatively stable for the past eight quarters. The allowance for loan losses grew to $80 million, which represents 1% of managed receivables and is consistent with last year. At 41.8%, CAF net penetration was up slightly compared to last year\u2019s third quarter in part due to our subprime test, which was not in place last year. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 20% to $1.2 billion due to a combination of the retail unit growth, higher penetration, and an increase in the average amount financed. As you know, from time to time we test additional third party lenders and if we determine they add sufficient incremental value, we roll them out across our system. During the quarter, we moved Allied Financial out of the testing phase to become our fifth Tier 2 lender. Finally as you probably noticed from the press release, our treasury department has been quite busy this quarter. We closed a three-year, $300 million private term loan. We added $300 million to our unsecured revolver capacity, bringing it to a total of $1 billion, and added $200 million to CAF\u2019s warehouse facility for a total of $2.3 billion. Now back to Tom. Tom Folliard : Thank you. In regards to our mix, during the quarter despite the decrease in oil prices, we didn\u2019t see a significant increase in our sales of SUVs and trucks compared to last year. We are starting to see some growth in sales of zero to four-year-old cars, which we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, compared to last year - they\u2019re now about 75% of sales, but that percentage is about the same as what it was in the second quarter.  SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11% to $317 million. This growth is primarily due to the addition of 20 stores since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. If you remember, in the second quarter we were on top of about 18 new stores. On a per-unit basis, SG&A decreased $52 to $22.43 compared to $22.95 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.  During the third quarter, we opened four stores, two in new markets for CarMax, Tupelo, Mississippi and Reno, Nevada, and two in existing markets, Portland, Oregon and Raleigh, North Carolina. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll open one more store in our new market in Cleveland, home of Katharine Kenny. Katharine Kenny : Woo-hoo! Tom Folliard : Store traffic was up once again in the quarter and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the third quarter compared to last year, average monthly web visits grew over 17% to nearly 14 million. Business to our mobile site continued to represent approximately 30% of total visits while visits utilizing our mobile apps represented another 15% of the total. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Matt Nemer : Good morning everyone, and congrats on an outstanding quarter. First question I wanted to ask about is whether the Auto Trader and the Cars.com addition or re-launch is maybe one of the factors that\u2019s driving your traffic, and I\u2019d love to hear about anything else that you think is driving the traffic in the stores and on the web. Obviously it seems like it was very strong. Tom Folliard : The first, Matt, a little background there. If you remember last year, throughout the whole year we had decided to no longer list our cars on Cars.com and AutoTrader.com, and we had 12% comps last year, 17% share gain, and one of the better years we\u2019ve ever had in the history of the company. The reason we stopped the first time is because we weren\u2019t making a good return on our investment. What we\u2019ve started back with the two of them is just a test, and the test is to determine whether or not we can make a good return on the investment. So it was a test during the quarter. I don\u2019t have a lot to report, but my guess is it had very little impact. Matt Nemer : Okay, then just a quick follow-up. The gross profit per unit has been extremely consistent over the last couple of years, and it ticked a little bit higher. Just wondering if you\u2019re starting to see--if you feel like you\u2019re getting--your ability to increase prices isn\u2019t impacting your unit sales, and that\u2019s kind of why that\u2019s starting to drift, and could we see that continue? Thanks. Tom Folliard : I view $20 as flat. If we were $20 down, we would have viewed it as just as good and just as consistent a performance, so it\u2019s not an exact science to manage this margin across this number of sales at this price point, so I\u2019d view that as just relatively flat and I think it just shows that we\u2019re getting better and more analytical each and every year and each and every quarter at managing our inventory and managing to our targeted margin. Despite some depreciation that we saw in the third quarter, which I think was pretty apparent in some external sources, we were able to manage our margins pretty tightly once again and deliver a 7.5% comp, so I\u2019m pretty proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished but we continue to work on it every year, and I think we get a little better each year. Matt Nemer : Great. Nice work, and happy holidays. Tom Folliard : Thanks. You too, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a really nice quarter. My first question, and it may be a follow-on to Matt\u2019s question too, but there\u2019s been a lot of chatter amongst investors with respect to declines in used car pricing and what impact that could have on CarMax. You saw some of your competitors have troubles; you obviously did not. Bigger picture, how are you thinking about it as you\u2019re looking at maybe the used car market now following a more normal pricing trajectory? How is that affecting, if at all, the CarMax business model? Tom Folliard : You know, we\u2019ve been at this for a while, Brian, and the fall is a time when we always see depreciation. We\u2019ve had some anomalies going into the recession and coming out of the recession, but in a normal year you expect some appreciation in January through the spring, and then we expect some depreciation throughout the rest of the year all the way through December. I think we\u2019ve proven that we can manage in all kinds of different volatile environments, and this one is not as volatile as we\u2019ve seen in the past, so we view this as--I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s business as usual, but it\u2019s normal depreciation that we see during the third quarter if you look at a 20-year history and say what does an average year look like. So I just think it\u2019s something that we\u2019re getting a little bit better at every year, just as I said to Matt on the last question. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question would be on the buyback. It wasn\u2019t that long ago you and your board introduced a pretty significant buyback plan for CarMax, and we did see buyback activity step up somewhat here in the third quarter. Any guidance you can give us how we should expect you to execute on that buyback as we going into 2015 and beyond? Tom Folliard : You know, Brian, I think the announcement that you saw from management and from our board was really just an authorization and a further commitment to delivering capital back to shareholders with a rather lengthy expiration date on it, so that it gave us the flexibility to continue to run the program that we\u2019ve been running. We could go a little more aggressively if we wanted, but it\u2019s just what it says - it\u2019s an authorization, it has a two-year limit on it, but I think it\u2019s a nice show of confidence from our board in our ability over the next few years to continue to run a good business and put ourselves in a position to keep delivering capital back to shareholders through the buyback. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thanks and congrats again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. A follow-up question on used car pricing, or to Brian\u2019s question there. Tom, there\u2019s a lot of concern that used car pricing might fade, yet all the data from you and the public dealers is actually positive on transaction prices. Is there the potential here that we\u2019re seeing some supply increase but demand actually increasing faster than that supply is increasing, and we might be in an environment where pricing stays relatively stable even as supply is increasing, which is really kind of a Goldilocks scenario for your business? Tom Folliard : You know, that\u2019s impossible to tell. Our average retail was actually down in the quarter compared to the second quarter of this year by $300, so I think that reflects a little bit of depreciation. As I\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to figure out what\u2019s going to happen a year from now. It\u2019s pretty irrelevant to us running our business day-to-day, and we turn our inventory quick enough that I think we\u2019re able to respond to whatever volatility the market has to offer. But I do think we\u2019ve seen some improvements in the economy. We saw a nice tick-up in the SAR. We\u2019ve always said whenever we see new car sales in the up-tick, that that shows that people are willing to get out there and buy a car and sign up for a loan, and I think that\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for the consumer overall in terms of their activity. But it\u2019s really difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future. John Murphy : Okay, and then just sort of a follow-up question here on SG&A. Typically we think there\u2019s leverage in the model at about a 7.5% positive same store sales comp, but as the store base gets larger, is it possible that that comes down over time and might get closer to 5%? I\u2019m just trying to understand how you think about leverage on SG&A as the store base gets larger. Tom Folliard : Yeah, that\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve never given a precise number because we\u2019re not sure what that number is. You never know what kind of incremental investments you might make at any given point in time. This is the most stores, the most new stores, so stores that are the most SG&A inefficient, that we\u2019ve ever carried, which is 20 during the third quarter, and we were still able to leverage by $50 on a per-unit basis our total SG&A with the 7.5% comp. So there\u2019s a combination of factors that are going to allow us to either leverage or not, so it happened to work out this quarter. I couldn\u2019t give you an exact number, but it does make sense logically that unless we dramatically accelerated our growth rate, that we\u2019d be able to leverage a little bit better as the base gets bigger. John Murphy : Thanks a lot. Great execution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from Keybanc. Your line is now open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about CAF profitability, specifically how do we think about a rising interest rate environment negatively impacting CAF profitability? How do you think about your cost of funds, what might be the best representative rate that you use or something like that, and is there any way that you can kind of say look, if we saw 100 basis point increase in that cost of funds, that would represent some sort of a dollar amount headwind to that $90 million that you made in the third quarter? How can we kind of quantify that? Tom Reedy : Well first off, I\u2019ve got to remind everybody, we\u2019re going to run a market business and kind of our APRs are going to be driven by competition and our cost of funds are going to be driven by what we can achieve in the marketplace. As far as what to look at for cost of funds, you can look at our securitization deals and the benchmarks in those, and that gives you kind of a good estimate of where we\u2019re locking down long-term financing. As far as profitability, we believe over time we can manage to a reasonable profit, at least to a market profit. In fact, if you look back at 2007, early 2008 to our securitization that we did back then, we were running at a very similar spread between APR and cost of funds then as we are today, and interest rates were 400 to 500 basis points higher than they are today. So we don\u2019t believe a higher interest rate market precludes a finance company from making the kind of returns that we\u2019ve been making recently; however, as you migrate towards higher interest rates, APRs are typically sticky upward and downward, and there might be a little bit of lag time for the market to adjust to rates rising, so you might see some compression in that as things are moving. We\u2019ve benefited from that when rates have fallen, we\u2019ve felt the pressure as rates are rising; but overall, I think we can manage a market rate of return on the business. Brett Hoselton : Okay. And then I apologize, Katharine, I\u2019m just getting a lot of questions about rising used vehicle--or excuse me, declining used vehicle growth or used vehicle prices. Obviously they haven\u2019t declined recently, but the general expectation is that used vehicle prices are going to decline, so getting a lot of questions from investors as to is that a net positive or a net negative for your firm? I think that we believe that it\u2019s a net position for you, but can you explain why you see that as a net positive, because I think you believe that as well. Tom Folliard : You know, I\u2019ve kind of answered that a couple of times, which is whatever the market delivers, we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job of navigating through it. I\u2019m always a believer lower prices are better for the consumer, and we turn our inventory quick enough that we can manage margins in a declining environment, but I\u2019m also not a believer we\u2019re going to see this giant decline in car prices because there\u2019s some tidal wave of supply coming our way. I think things tend to find a way to equal out. Brett Hoselton : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. I was looking for clarification real quick. Did you say Allied was added to the Tier 2 or Tier 3? Tom Reedy : Tier 2, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Obviously subprime bounced back--subprime penetration bounced back sequentially from what we saw last quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit more about that, because obviously we had seen some deterioration in that trend over the prior last few quarters, and is that just a function of guys like Santander becoming more aggressive? Was there any other changes that might have happened on the subprime side, just to help us think about what happens in the future? Tom Reedy : You know, I can\u2019t really speak to if there\u2019s been any changes. What I can speak to is we have seen over the past several months relatively stable behavior from our subprime lenders. We saw the big correction last year as they adjusted their behavior, but if we look at conversion of customers that were given acceptances, I think it would be fair to say that the behaviors have been relatively consistent over the last several months. As to where that goes going forward, we want them to run a good and sustainable business, and we\u2019re going to encourage them to do that, and things will shake out the way they do. There\u2019s really nothing beyond that I can really say about the bounce back, other than we feel like we\u2019ve been in a pretty stable place for the last several months. Tom Folliard : Hey, it\u2019s only a point and a half or two in terms of percent of sales, so it\u2019s not--it wasn\u2019t anything significant, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Right, no I understand. One thing that I think had been mentioned previously is there\u2019s been a blending of some of the, let\u2019s call it top tier subprime customers where some of the Tier 2 lenders have kind of moved into that portion of the customer base. Any feel for what the impact is or any way to kind of size the impact of Tier 2 getting a little bit more aggressive on the down side? Tom Reedy : I think the easiest way to look at it--the way we look at it is we\u2019re moving customers from a bucket where we\u2019re paying a discount to our lenders to one where we\u2019re receiving a premium from them, so there\u2019s a significant shift in profitability. Just like the Tier 3 lenders, we\u2019re encouraging the Tier 2 lenders to run a business that\u2019s sustainable for them over a long time. I think we\u2019ve seen their credit appetite increase over the last several quarters - that\u2019s been a good thing for us, and the reason we manage a large stable of lenders there is so that we can get the best offers for CarMax customers on an ongoing basis. Tom Folliard : But Scot, it\u2019s also difficult to quantify very specifically because of the way we run our credit. We run a waterfall of credit. It goes from one tier of lenders down to the next, down to the next. If it gets picked up in the middle, then the bottom tier never see the application in the first place. So it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds to say, oh, we got half a point or a point and a half from this or that; but to Tom\u2019s point, anything that gets picked up on the way down is a positive, and we have a bunch of lending partners and we\u2019re grateful for all the relationships that we\u2019ve built over the years, but they all run their own models and we hope they run them profitably and they can stay with us for a long time. Scot Ciccarelli : All right, got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question as well. Tom, you mentioned the drop in oil, and that seems like good news for most of your customers, but I also imagine it signals some tougher times in oil-based economies. Just wondering if you\u2019ve seen that dynamic play out at all in some of those markets. Tom Folliard : Not that I know of. The way I look at that is you remember that the CarMax customer is the average American consumer, and the average American consumer has a little more spending money at this gas rate than they had before, so I think that\u2019s a positive for people\u2019s outlook, for their budget, for their wallet, for their consideration when they\u2019re looking to sign up for a loan for a few years. I think on the new car side, you saw it really impact the mix, and although we haven\u2019t seen it impact the mix as much, we were probably already a little more heavily skewed to SUVs and things like that in the first place. So we haven\u2019t really seen an impact on mix much, but I think the American consumer having a little more money to spend is a good thing. Craig Kennison : And is CAF or are your lending partners at all looking at markets like Texas or other oil-based markets and saying, you know what? We\u2019ve got to score that customer differently because their incomes may actually change? Tom Reedy : We haven\u2019t had any discussions with them along that front. Like Tom and I said, we\u2019re going to encourage them to run a business that makes sense for them, and we\u2019re going to do the same; and if we have something to talk about on that front, then we will. Tom Folliard : There\u2019s volatility in gas prices. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re a lender, you want to assume that this is where gas prices are going to stay for the next five years. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, and good morning. I\u2019ve got one follow-up to someone else\u2019s question and then one of my own. On the subprime piece, can you talk about whether the mix of your Tier 3 providers has changed meaningfully over the course of the past year, and whether that might have contributed at all to the moderate decline in subprime penetration? Tom Reedy : No Matt, the mix has been very consistent over the past year. The only change has been that, as you know, CarMax is running a test and took a little bit of that volume starting this year, a very small part of the volume, and we are not behaving any differently or more aggressively than our partners. Matthew Fassler : Got it, and then secondly, your wholesale profitability, while it was not off the charts, it was very good and showed a bit of a pick-up year-on-year in the rate of growth in wholesale margins. Any comments on what\u2019s driving your ability to continue to extract more in terms of gross profit per vehicle through your auction process? Tom Folliard : Similar to what I said on the retail side, Matt, it\u2019s $40 up, down, pretty close. It\u2019s just good management. As you know how we run our auctions, the car sells to the top bidder, and we adjust our prices weekly as we sell through our auction. We\u2019ve had great execution in our stores, we\u2019ve had great attendance from our dealers who come to our auction and support our pricing each and every week, and I think we just continue to do a good job running our auctions. But as I said before, if we get pretty close on the margin, we consider that to be good, so it was slightly up but that\u2019s essentially flat for us. Matthew Fassler : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Thanks. Good morning everybody. On that improvement in conversion that you mentioned in your release, is that a function of the types of customers that you\u2019re seeing coming through the door, lender behavior, or is it something else? I would imagine that if trade-in volumes moderated a little bit, that would not have necessarily helped. Tom Folliard : No, you know, conversion for us is really a team effort. It\u2019s a combination of buying the right cars, having the right inventory at the right store at the right time, doing a great job reconditioning, having high quality cars. We\u2019ve done a lot of training with our sales force to be able to execute and help customers overcome objections, whether it\u2019s on the trade-in or their financing or what car they want to buy. Financing is obviously access to financing, and the rate that they receive is another piece of conversion. The search engine we have on our website, I just think over time we expect to be able to continue to improve conversion, but it\u2019s very difficult to point to one specific area. But as it relates directly to finance, we didn\u2019t have anything significant change in the quarter to contribute to that. As we said in the press release, our comps were driven partly by an increase in traffic and partly by an increase in conversion, and that\u2019s what I would expect over time for us, is to be able to improve both of those marginally over time. Rod Lache : Okay, and just really quickly, I was wondering if you had any other follow-up comments on the CAF test in subprime. What are some of the takeaways and adjustments you\u2019re making, and what is sort of the trajectory we should be expecting from here? Tom Reedy : Yeah, it\u2019s still a bit early. We\u2019re seeing the first vintages that we originated kind of across a six-month time frame, and we really need to go through a full tax season, a full cycle with this product before we can make any conclusions. So what I can say is that we have not seen anything negative and unexpected that would lead us to dial back or not continue to test. Like I said, we\u2019d like to get through tax season and continue through the test that we have, and figure out where we go from there at the end of the year. We\u2019ll probably have something to say about where we\u2019re going because we\u2019re likely to use up that initial $70 million during the quarter. Rod Lache : Great, thank you. Congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Ravi Shankar]: Good morning everyone. This is [indiscernible] in for Ravi. Just to follow up on the subprime pilot program, you initially set out to do $70 million through the end of last quarter. If you can provide some color as to what prevented you from deploying the entire $70 million? Tom Reedy : I think we\u2019ve said we were going to run a test for $70 million. I don\u2019t think we gave any guidance on how long it would take. We\u2019ve been doing a bit of it every quarter and we\u2019re continuing to test it as we go; and as I said, next quarter I think we can give you some more visibility to where we\u2019ll go from beyond that initial 70 test. [Ravi Shankar]: Thanks for the clarification. Then on competition, you\u2019re planning to expand your presence in the Denver market with, I think, a couple more stores in addition to a couple already there. Sonic recently launched their EchoPark stores in that market and are looking to add more stores as well. Wanted to get your thoughts on what the initial share and pricing response has been like, and where do you see it going? Tom Folliard : We really don\u2019t have anything to report there. They\u2019ve been open for a very short window of time. We\u2019ve been open for a couple of years with two stores. Denver has always been a very attractive market for us. We\u2019ve owned real estate there for a number of years. We have a couple more stores coming in the next 12 to 18 months, but they were coming anyway, and then we have an additional store down in Colorado Springs. But their store has been open for only a month or two, so nothing to report at this time. [Ravi Shankar]: Thanks so much. Operator : Again if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Rick Nelson : Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to ask about the other segment revenues. The growth in extended protection plan revenue really accelerated this quarter. If you could comment there, that\u2019d be helpful. Tom Reedy : If you remember, last year we had a significant adjustment in the extended protection plan reserve, and so the reason you see a significant increase this year year-over-year is really because last year was impaired a bit. If you back out that adjustment, it\u2019s more like a 9% increase in those other revenues, and that comes from a combination of the extended protection plans, an improvement in the mix between subprime and non-prime, which means we have less discount that we pay to the subprime providers, and kind of relatively flat service income. But the reason that\u2019s such a big step-up was because last year was down. Rick Nelson : Thank you for that. Also, you opened 13 stores last year, 10 the year before. Any color on as to how those stores are coming into the comps and how big a driver they are to the nice comp you reported this quarter? That\u2019d be helpful. Tom Folliard : Well, it\u2019s awfully early in their life, but if you look at the size of the base, one year\u2019s worth of openings impact on comps, the first year that those stores become comp stores is very, very little. But obviously over time, they\u2019ll add to the total sales. You look at our total increase of 14% - half of that is coming from new stores and half of that is coming from the existing stores with the 7% comp. But we\u2019re on a pretty steady opening pace. You mentioned we opened 10 the year prior, 13 last year. We\u2019ll get another 13 open this year and we\u2019re still on that 10 to 15 store pace for the next couple of years, and lots of great places for us to go build stores, lots of markets that we\u2019re going back in and adding new stores. Rick Nelson : Thanks a lot, and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Please go ahead. Bill Armstrong : Good morning. The only question I have left is on the EPP penetration rate. It was lower a little bit. I was wondering if you could expand on that, and maybe I don\u2019t know if you would disclose what the actual penetration rates are this year versus last year and why they are down. Tom Reedy : Yeah, it is down a couple points. It\u2019s not down significantly. As we discussed early in the year with the change in the reserve, we were going to make some changes to pricing to recover that additional reserve, and we also talked about the fact that our partners continually are having us change prices on their product in order to preserve their business, based on the experience they see in the portfolio. There have been price changes based on their needs as well, so what we\u2019ve seen is some price changes and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a degradation in penetration, but I think we need to see where that\u2019s going to shake out over the course of the year because penetration is also highly dependent on people\u2019s performance in the stores and the initiatives that we have around selling that product. Tom Folliard : But our penetration is around 60%. We\u2019re really proud of our execution. I think our store teams do a great job of working with customers and showing them the value of buying an extended service plan, and our providers do a really good job of managing that through the life of the car. So we think we offer a great product and our customers realize the value in it, and we do as good a job as anybody out there in selling this product and then delivering a great experience for the customer after. Bill Armstrong : So it sounds like the decline in penetration is more an issue of pricing rather than execution? Tom Folliard : Yeah, and as Tom said, we talked about that at the beginning of this year. Bill Armstrong : Yeah, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. Looking at your cash flow statement and ignoring the increase in auto loan receivables, and then just doing an adjusted CFO minus CAPEX and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, and for the nine months \u201914 versus nine months \u201913, it\u2019s down quite a bit, which looks to be the increase in inventory. So obviously we\u2019ve got a lot more inventory supply coming online. Do you think over the next 12 months you\u2019re going to continue to have a lot of decrease in working capital from inventory accumulation? Tom Folliard : We\u2019re going to manage our inventory in line with what our sales expectations are, and then also with the fact that we are continuing to build stores and we\u2019re building them all over the place, and we\u2019re building at a pace of about a store a month or a little better than that. So oftentimes--a lot of times, you look at our inventory and some of it is just based on timing - when is the next store being opened, are we reconditioning those cars in another market, getting them ready for that other store. But even if you look at our inventory reported at the end of the quarter, about half of the unit increase is in our existing stores, which delivered a 7.5% comp, and about half our unit increase in represented in our new stores. So our inventory will go up as our store base goes up and our comp sales go up, but it won\u2019t necessarily--it\u2019s not going to exceed that to any great degree. Tom Reedy : I think there\u2019s a bit of seasonality in that as well. Q3 was a significant inventory build as we\u2019re coming into the tax season, so you\u2019d need to look at it over a more spread out period, I think. David Whiston : Okay. Last question - I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about starting from scratch on targeting inventory mix weekly, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more IT in the company over the past few years. Are you really at the point where you\u2019re sourcing, maybe even changing your sourcing habits daily or several times a day? Tom Folliard : No, not really. It doesn\u2019t move that fast. Weekly is pretty fast, especially with the size of the investment in each individual car. Remember that half of our cars right now are coming from appraisals that we\u2019re buying directly from the consumer, and you really need a week\u2019s worth of data at least before you can make a decision about what to do the following week. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the way we\u2019re managing it right now. I think what has gotten better and better for us each and every year is the ability to apply that data to a buying model that is very, very store-specific, and then the other benefit that we\u2019ve gained over the last several years is as our brand gets stronger, the more cars that are on our website, the better the pictures, the better the search engine, the more accessibility the customer has to inventory in other markets, and that\u2019s about a third of our sales, are cars transferred at the customer\u2019s request, so it\u2019s another way for us to leverage that inventory. But I think hopefully we\u2019ll continue to get better at this. David Whiston : You said transfers are a third of sales? Tom Folliard : Roughly, yeah - right around 30%. David Whiston : Okay, thanks. Operator : We have no further questions in the queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Folliard, CEO. [end of Q&A]: Tom Folliard : All right, thank you very much. I want to thank all of you for joining us today on the call. I also of course want to thank all of our associates for everything they do every day, especially around the holiday season. I wish all of you guys happy holidays, and we will talk to you again next quarter. Thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone, thanks for joining the call today. As you saw by now, we had both a record fourth quarter and a record fiscal year. During the year, total revenues grew to more than $14 billion and we sold nearly 1 million total vehicles, more than 591,000 retail cars and 376,000 wholesale cars through our in-store auctions. Here are some of the key highlights for the year; used unit comps, up 4% and total used units grew by over 10%. Wholesale vehicle gross profit, up 16%, driven by a 10% increase in units sold, and an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of $54 per car. CAF income up 9% to more than $367 million, Tom will give some more details on that in a moment. Excluding the items we highlighted in the press release, net income for the fiscal year increased 16% and EPS grew 21%. Our data indicates, that for the calendar year 2014, we increased our share of the zero to 10 year old used vehicle market by approximately 5%. We also continue to focus on returning value to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2015, we bought back 17.5 million shares at a cost of a little over $900 million. Since we began the program in fiscal 2013, we have purchased more than 30 million shares. Now on to some of the key drivers for the fourth quarter, used unit comps, up 7%, driven by an increase in traffic, as well as an improvement in conversion. Total used units grew by 12%. Wholesale gross profit, up 22%, reflecting a 12% increase in units sold, and an increase of $83 in gross profit per unit. GAAP quarterly income up 12% to $90 million, and again, excluding the items we shared in the press release, net income for the fourth quarter increased 20%, and earnings per share up 28%. With that, I will turn it over to Tom, and he will give you some details around CAF. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. CAF recorded another solid year, with 9% income growth to $367 million, and growth in average managed receivables of 19%. As Tom mentioned, in the fourth quarter, CAF income was $90.4 million, up 12% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and Q4 average managed receivables grew 18%, to $8.3 billion. CAF's weighted average contract rate, that rate that we charge to customers, was flat to last year's fourth quarter at 7.2%. This rate continues to be relatively stable, at around 7% for the past couple of years. The allowance for loan losses grew to about $82 million, this represents 1% of managed receivables, which is relatively consistent with last year but during the quarter and the year CAF income did benefit from favorable loss experience. CAF net penetration was 40.9% compared to 40.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This figure includes originations from our subprime test, and if you back out those originations, this quarter's penetration would have been 40.2%, which is similar to last year. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 16% to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax's unit sales growth, our modestly higher penetration and a small increase in the average amount financed. Finally, we intend to continue with our subprime test. Recall that our primary goal for this investment, was to gain knowledge regarding this space, and we expect these learnings will prove invaluable. While performance to-date is in line with our expectations, we believe allowing the receivables to [indiscernible] deeper into their life, including maturing through a full tax season, will better equip us to assess our long term strategy. On average, the terms of these contracts is nearly 70 months, and at fiscal year end, the average time on our books for loans is less than seven months. We are comfortable continuing to originate at the current target volume which is 5% of CarMax's subprime sales or a little less than 2% of CAF originations. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. As far as mix of sales, sales of zero to four year old vehicles grew to approximately 75% of our total sales, the same as the third quarter by over five percentage points higher than last year's fourth quarter. Sales of SUVs and trucks as a percentage was similar to last year. SG&A for the quarter, increased approximately 11% to $330 million, contributing to this growth, was the addition of 18 stores, since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, and a $9 million increase in share based compensation expense. On a per unit basis, SG&A decreased $23 to $2186 compared to $2,209 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During the fourth quarter, we opened one store in our new Cleveland market, in Katharine's hometown. Since the fourth quarter, we opened two more stores, one in Minneapolis, a new market for CarMax, and one yesterday in Turnersville, New Jersey, which is part of our Philadelphia market. In addition to these two, we plan to open 12 more stores in fiscal 2016, plus the relocation of our store in Rockville, Maryland. In regards to our small format test, we have now opened five stores, and as a group, they are performing at or above our expectations. We expect the small format stores to be a part of our store openings going forward. Of our 14 store openings in fiscal 2016, there will be three small format, including our first small format front store, with full production capability in the back, and that will be in Gainesville, Florida. Also, we now plan to open between 13 and 16 stores annually over the next three years. Store traffic, was up once again in the quarter, and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the fourth quarter, average monthly web visits grew over 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter, to over 14.5 million visits, and visits to our mobile site now represent approximately 32% of the total, while visits utilizing our mobile app, represent another 16% of the total. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi good morning. Tom Folliard : Hi Brian. Brian Nagel : Congratulations on a nice quarter and a nice year. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So I have got just a couple of questions here; a question and then I guess a follow-up. First off, just a point of clarification, you mentioned the subprime test and the continuation of that test. So are you now planning to go above the prior stated $70 million size in the test? And then if so, how should we think about -- I guess there could be the new volume relative to that initial goal\u2026 Tom Reedy : Hey, Brian, I am sorry if I wasn't clear, but I think in the release we say we did $72 million up to the end of fiscal 2015. So that's what we did through the year. What I said is, we are comfortable continuing at the same pace, which is about 5% of the subprime business that CarMax does. So if subprime continues to be a similar number of our sales as last year, it\u2019ll be a similar pace of volume for us. Brian Nagel : Okay. That's helpful, thank you. Also on this follow-up; also on the subprime business, if you look at not just what you originate but what your partners originate as well, any commentary there about the willingness of your partners to lend -- I guess couple of quarters, where we saw some type of disruption, just look a lot of rumblings of the market with what's going on out there. Are you seeing any shifts at all in the willingness of your partners to lend subprime based accounts? Tom Reedy : Well I think, if you look year-over-year, we are at 17 versus 17.6 as a percent of subprime in the business. Last year's fourth quarter is when we really first started feeling any changes in behavior. And as I mentioned, I think on the last call, we have seen pretty consistent behavior out of our partners for the last several quarters. The key thing that we are looking at, is the quality of their offers, and what that translates into, just how many of the customers that receive offers from them, actually convert to a sale. Our subprime partners cannot control the nature of what's coming into them, because the tier-2 lenders are looking at it ahead of time, and have the first look at that. So on the basis of conversions of offers, we assume their behavior would be very consistent, and we are very happy with their performance. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. So I think, this might be -- in the press release you indicated you're doing 15 remodels this year, and one relo. And I don't really remember any remodeling program at CarMax; can you talk about kind of what you expect to do on the remodels if there is anything operationally that that will affect, or if it\u2019s more cosmetic? And then the relo, just where is that, and is there the opportunity for more relos in the CarMax system? Tom Folliard : Sure. So first of all, over our history, we have constantly spent capital on keeping our stores up-to-date and renovating them over time. Since we launched the next-gen concept, I forget, four or five years ago now, we have now gone back in, and we are applying some of those technology changes with some more digital screens and some digital capabilities in the store. As well as open seating, which we really had prior to next gen, but we think it\u2019s a much more efficient use of floor space. And so the conversions are a little more extensive than they have been, because we are doing a combination of technology and converting, whether its cubes or offices into floor space, we just finished converting our Richmond store and it looks fantastic and that's the oldest store in the chain. I think we completed three or four of these types of conversions, and they're a little bit more expensive than the money that would have been spent. So we just thought we would call it out, and we plan to do another 17 this year. In terms of operational changes, it doesn't change much operationally, but I think it provides a better experience for our customers, and a better working environment for our associates as well. So we have been pretty pleased with what we have done so far, and we will gauge the results going forward, and see how much more aggressively we want to spend. In terms of the relo, that's our Rockville store; our Rockville store was originally a competitor who built a kind of a copycat. It\u2019s a very small footprint. I think it\u2019s only on five acres or so, and it has been a very successful store for us. This is just a situation where the lease was up for renewal, and we took the opportunity to move -- we are really only moving a short distance away from that store, to a much bigger facility, and that store has been very successful for us. But it was really undersized the whole time we had it. At this time, we don't have any other plans for relos, this one was just more opportunistic as the lease came up. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. How are you? Tom Folliard : Good. You Scot? Scot Ciccarelli : Good, thanks. So I think the last couple of quarters, you talked about tier-2 becoming a bit more aggressive, in terms of their lending, and that was -- subprime penetration was starting to moderate a little bit. But subprime penetration has kind of rebounded, at least sequentially the last two quarters. Does that mean tier-2s pull back a bit, or should we just see that as more overall credit availability, when you look at the overall market? Tom Reedy : Hi Scot, this is Tom. I think you\u2019re better to viewing it as Tier-3 stabilizing versus reading anything into overall credit availability. Tier-2 is still doing very strong for us, and we said we are happy with our partners. We brought in some new partners, we have a really good diverse stable of finance partners in tier-2 and it\u2019s performing well for us. Scot Ciccarelli : Can you give us an idea kind of what tier-2 is going on penetration rate, kind of on a year-over-year basis Tom? Tom Reedy : Clearly, what we have seen is something in a low 40s for CarMax auto finance, and we have said 20% to 25% gets financed outside the CarMax system, and the rest being kind of split between tier-2 and tier-3. I'd say that in the current environment we are looking at kind of the lower end of that 20% to 25% for other, and tier-2 and tier-3 are doing 35 -- we said tier-3 was at 17, so that gives you a pretty good flavor. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Tom Folliard : Thanks Scot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, could you just give us the buy-rate, if you did not provide that in the quarter? And then second, related to your ad spending, it appears to have declined after four quarters of strong growth. How should we think about ad spending going forward, and what are your key priorities for marketing under your leadership there? Tom Folliard : What was the first part again? Craig Kennison : The buy rate? Tom Folliard : Sorry. Buy rate was right around 30%, very similar to last year, and in terms of ad spend, we did a Super Bowl last year, we did not do a Super Bowl this year. So some of that -- most of the change is just the subtraction of Super Bowl year-over-year. But in terms of kind of a regular scheduled spend, it was in line with what we were trying to accomplish. Craig Kennison : And any change in priorities, under the new leadership? Tom Folliard : We are making a lot of changes, and we are evaluating how best to spend our money, but that will be an ongoing process for us. So continued strong effort on TV, we are pretty much out of print, and have been for a long time, and continuing to try to optimize our paid search, as well as trying to improve our SEO, our search engine optimization through organic search. And continuing to test using outside partners as well. So, you know, a similar mix, but we will see what happens going forward. Craig Kennison : Great. Congratulations. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew (sic) Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Good morning. It's Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Tom Folliard : Good morning Michael. Matthew Fassler : Go figure. My primary question here relates to wholesale. So you had -- from what I can tell is, the highest level of wholesale profitability per vehicle you've ever had in the fourth quarter. You also had the biggest year-on-year increase in wholesale gross profit per vehicle that you've had in about five years. Just curious whether there is anything in the backdrop other than your stellar execution, that would lead to that kind of pop in the wholesale profit number? Tom Folliard : First, thank you for calling our execution stellar. And you know, really good execution continues to build year-over-year. You're right, it\u2019s the first fourth quarter we have ever had, that exceeded $1,000 in profit per car. We have had two first quarters that have done that in the past. But, as our reputation builds, it\u2019s a great place for dealers to come and buy this type of product. I think our stores do a great job of marketing, and we are \u2013 it\u2019s always a balancing act between wholesale margin and making sure we have a very strong buy rate. Remember, lots of the customers that are selling us these cars are also buying a car from us. So a good barometer for how fair we are being with our customers with our buy rate, which I just mentioned was very strong at 30%. So again this is -- wholesale is always at balance with retail. It\u2019s never a standalone business that can be managed separately. You always have to pay attention to what's happening on the retail side. So I am really proud of the stores and how well they have executed. We have some stores that are particularly tight on space, and have to manage running -- some stores running two auctions a week out in California, and we have just started -- the stores have done a fantastic job of managing relationships and making sure we get great attendance. And that has lead to a great performance. Matthew Fassler : Has the fact that prices based on some of the Mannheim indices have been particularly resilient, maybe that surprisingly so, kind of been part of the profitability story here, or would you say that it\u2019s independent of that? Tom Folliard : No, I think that's a factor too. And usually at this time of the year, coming out of the winter, you start to see some movement up in the Mannheim index, and we se that as well. So that's always a little bit of a tailwind for us, in terms of margin, when we see an appreciating market. I don't think it was up that much in the last report, but it\u2019s typically a time of the year, when we see some appreciation. Matthew Fassler : And then, just a follow-up and hopefully you will consider this a public service request, rather than a question. Just a little bit of color on the capitalized interest add back and just what that number is, why it would have looked different this quarter versus prior quarters? Tom Reedy : Hey Matt, the only thing we'd really say about that, is it was a miss on our part. We are required to capitalize interest on construction projects and it netted against other interest expense. So as you saw, it was 8.9 in Q4, 6.9 of that related to periods before Q4 this year. Look back at other periods, and it made the determination that the impact is not material on any earlier period. So it\u2019s just something we will be doing going forward, but it was a miss. Matthew Fassler : So some of it shut up in prior periods, and you shut it here, it\u2019s a catch-up if you will? Tom Reedy : Yes. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you so much. Tom Reedy : And that it all would have been in this year. Matthew Fassler : Understood. Operator : Your next question is from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. James Albertine : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations as well. I just had a quick sort of housekeeping; I noticed your cash balance as one of the lowest you have had in quite some time, and in light of the store growth and the renovations and remodels and everything you're working from on that perspective. Is that something that's temporary or how should we think about that from the fourth quarter? Tom Reedy : I mean, as far as the cash balance goes, I can kind of walk you through what we did this year. If you look -- we went through $600 million in cash plus took out a $300 million term loan, that's $900 million of stock buyback during the year was a little bit greater than $917 million. So what that means is, all the other spend that we had during the year, CapEx, needs for CAF and inventory, which again totaled another $900 million, were covered by cash flow in the core business. So as far as liquidity goes, I mean, we are in an environment where we feel pretty good about our banks allowing us to step up and live up to their commitments on our revolving credit facility, a $1 billion facility. We will manage with some amount of liquidity that we can run the business with. I think the decline in the cash balance was planned and deliberate, and the business is still generating lot of cash. And if you look kind of closely at it, it reflects that. Tom Folliard : And we sought them in the past about moving towards a more optimal capital structure, so this is just us kind of delivering on stuff that we have already talked about. James Albertine : Very good. Just a quick follow-up if I may; any thoughts on the Wells Fargo announcement with the capping of subprime loans; and if we start to see that elsewhere, how should we sort of think about that probably over the market? Thanks. Tom Folliard : Yeah, I am always hesitant to talk about anything outside of CarMax with regards to subprime, because everybody thinks about subprime differently. And if you recall, Wells Fargo is not one of our -- what we call our subprime partners, but I am sure in the Tier-2 space, they originate loans that some people would define as subprime. So that's one thing; I mean, that's really an evidence of why keep a diverse stable of partners, to make sure that our customers have access to financing and access to give credit offers at all times, and I think we feel like we are in a pretty good shape there. Also historically, we believe that our partners have opted to direct volume towards CarMax, at the expense of other places, because they like the origination channel, the clarity of information and the knowledge about what the asset is really worth, etcetera. So we have observed in tough times before, that we felt we were less impacted than other folks. Who knows what that means going forward, but that's probably as much color as I can give you. James Albertine : Good. Thanks again, and good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : Hey everybody. Good morning and terrific results. Question for you on the technology, if it\u2019s okay. I think you said your web traffic was up 9%, I know a lot of retailers have web traffic up a lot more than their own sales. And so irrespective of that, I am hoping you can give us a little lens or window into kind of technology, as you're using it incrementally to run your own business and enable sales; and also, maybe from the competitive standpoint, what you're seeing out there in terms of technology or apps or things like that, that might be causing any pressure down the road? Tom Folliard : Thanks Aram. So we have used technology at our stores from the very beginning, and a combination of things, both for our associates and for our customers. So we employ a lot of use of data, and the ability to deliver that data back to our employees. At the moment, they need it to make good decisions. We have lots of ability to track customers through the process and make future decisions based on that. So I think we have done a pretty good job of utilizing technology in our stores, so that our associates can deliver a great customer experience. In terms of customer facing, it\u2019s something that we continue to invest in and we will continue to invest in more, going forward. We want to make sure that we can communicate with our customers. However it is that they want to communicate with us. I have talked in the past about being a little bit behind in terms of mobile. We will continue to invest there. We have made lots of improvements over time to our pictures and the quality of our pictures. We used to take one to nine, we are up to around 40. We have high definition pictures, we have zoom capability, we have adjusted our landing pages to be more personalized, and we will continue to make some efforts in that regard as well. And I think you will see us do a lot more stuff, as it relates to mobile, and touch screen. Its -- more than 50% of our total hits to our web site are now coming from either a mobile device or a tablet, and its something that we need to make sure that the customer has a fantastic experience, if they want to communicate with us in that format. So those are the kinds of things we continue to invest in, and we have tested online capabilities, which is a lot -- you see a lot of niche-y type of things from various -- whether they're competitors, or people who enable our competitors; things such as online current applications which we are testing, the ability to transfer our car from one location to another, without speaking to our sales consultant; the ability to put a credit card payment down to have those cards transferred, which we are doing. You can go online and put a car on hold, you can make an appointment with our sales consultant. So we have done a lot of stuff, to make sure customers can do more and more of the process from home. They can fill out a good chunk of the paperwork before they show up at our store. But all these things, are the types of stuff that we need to continue to invest then. But I think we have made a lot of nice progress, but we got a long way to go. Aram Rubinson : Sounds like you're not resting on your laurels. Thanks a lot. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Aram. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about productivity in terms of used units sold per dealership. And I guess, the way I was thinking about it is, pre-recession, you guys averaged about 4,800 units, which was well over of 4,000 of zero to four year old cars, by my math. Just looking ahead in coming years, we think the supply of zero to four year old vehicles is going to grow by about 25%, 30% over the next five or six years, and ultimately could drive a 10% to 15% tailwinded throughput. Can you just comment on that at all, about what maybe what some of the risks are to that, or if there's something that improvement missing? And then secondarily, I'd just love to get your thoughts around profitability on a dealership level, if you're able to get that kind of throughput, any structural impediments to retail EBIT margins going up in that environment? Tom Reedy : First on your comment about throughput annualized of zero to four year old cars, we never adjust zero to four year old cars, we have always been zero to 10. So it\u2019s a much broader spectrum of vehicles than you stated there. That number did change over time, as I stated in my comments; zero to four year old cars represent 75% of our sales, that was 70% just a couple of years ago, so it has moved by about five points. But you kind of have to look at a much broader spectrum of inventory to look at total sales fro CarMax. And it does look like, you would see a supply movement in zero to four, just base don movement in zero to four, just based on movement in SAR, and as I said before, we have historically had higher share in the zero to four year old segment. So is there a potential tailwind, probably, but the other factor there is consumer behavior, and will they trade out cars as much as they used to and you have population growth and new drivers and things like that. So there is lots of different variables and factors, and I don't think you can just say, we expect whatever the number you said, 20% or 10%, I forget what number you said there. But I don't think we can just expect that as an increase in sales. In terms of how do the stores handle it, we have been able to deliver exceptionally high volumes out of some pretty limited space in our stores, and all comp sales are more profitable than sales, once you've cleared all of your expenses. So it\u2019s very-very profitable for the company to continue to deliver comp sales out of existing facilities, because a lot of your fixed overhead remains comp spending, really just have to add some variable overhead. So we are really pleased with the comps we delivered over the last couple of years. I think its one of the great parts of our business model, is that our stores continue to grow. As I said, we gained 5% share during the year, that's on top of a 17% share gain the year prior. But once again, that's over a zero to 10 year old car. So I think our stores are well primed to take advantage of supply increases as that translates to sales, and they are well positioned to turn that into better than average profits, because they are all on top of a base that's already covered fixed overhead. Michael Montani : Thanks. Congratulations and good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : Good morning and thank you. My question is around comp sales growth. Tom, you spoke to traffic conversion driving the comp; maybe you can break that down, how much of it was traffic and how much was conversion? And related to that, what was driving the better conversion? Tom Folliard : Seth, that's a good question. We get that frequently. It was roughly 50-50 in terms of conversion and traffic, and I always thought that over time, it will be 50-50. It doesn\u2019t line up all the time, sometimes it all comes from conversion sometimes it all comes from traffic, this happens to be one where it maxed up. As we have looked at over a very long period of time and the way we think about it going forward is, I would like to be able to continue to increase traffic to our stores, and I'd like to be able to do better with the traffic that we have. And in terms of what are we doing to improve conversion, we have some really fantastic people in our stores that are dedicated and committed everyday to give the customer a great experience. We've tried to do a good job of providing additional training. Some of the stuff I talked about earlier in terms of technology as it relates to information and capabilities that our associates have, we have improved over the last several years, and plan to continue to improve going forward. So I really think it\u2019s just a testament to our 20,000 dedicated employees in the stores who work really hard everyday to try to be more and more efficient, and give the customer a better experience. Hopefully, that turns into higher sales, and they in turn go and tell all their friends and become spokespeople for CarMax. It has worked for us in the past, and I expect it to keep working going forward. Seth Basham : So [indiscernible] would you say there was any difference in the quality credit offers, or the credit availability that has affected the conversion trends over the last few quarters? Tom Reedy : That's another thing that's constantly on the move. It\u2019s a combination of what we do, a combination of what our partners do. I think Tom mentioned -- this was a relatively stable year, compared to some in the past, where we have seen some movements, whether its up or down from some of the lenders, we saw a big pullback during the recession, we saw some changes over the last coupled of years in subprime up or down. But this year has been relatively stable in terms of credit. Seth Basham : Great. Thank you guys. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : How have franchise dealers have opened stores and your markets have -- you could comment there, the impact that they might be having, how you respond from a competitive standpoint and overall thoughts on those [indiscernible]? Tom Folliard : Sure, thanks Rick. I know Sonic opened some stores in the Denver talking, and Asbury opened some stores in the Florida market. We are clearly more established in Florida, we have been there for a much longer period of time. Neither of those concepts have been open very long, so it\u2019s very difficult for us to read any results or impacts at this time. When we have some, we will be happy to share it, but both of those concepts have been open for a very short period of time and I really can't comment on their performance. Tom Reedy : I think Sonic has been open for less than six months, and Asbury has been open, I think around a year. So the stores are a little bit smaller than ours. Some of them are closer than others, but so far, it\u2019s too early to comment. Rick Nelson : In March here, you had talked about the move from zero to 10 year old bucket. Can you discuss where the gains are the biggest, and that sort of what your old bucket -- [indiscernible]? Tom Folliard : You know Rick, I actually don't know the answer to that, I am not sure we are having that level of detail. We generally guess the whole market, you saw that we said it\u2019s through calendar year this year. This is the data that we have bought, and the reason we have gone to yearly announcements is that data is very, I would call unstable in the short term. So we are pretty confident in the direction and the number, but in terms of dividing it very specifically, we haven't really done that. Rick Nelson : Got you. Thanks a lot and good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning guys. I see that your average selling price for retail was down about $600 sequentially. Is that a function of mix, or are you seeing maybe some decline in pricing trends? And related to that, when you're out -- you're buying cars at auctions, what sort of trends are you seeing right now, in terms of supply and price trends? Tom Folliard : Yes. That's mostly seasonality. We see a seasonal drop in the fourth quarter. Really fourth quarter over fourth quarter our average retails were up slightly. So not really much there. If you look at our mix sequentially of zero to four year old cars, didn't really move very much. It did move from this year's fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, by almost five points, which would lead you to believe that may be prices would go the other direction. So I think it\u2019s more just a seasonal movement and nothing really else to read into there. In terms of what we are seeing at the auctions, this is the time of the year, when we always see appreciation in the marketplace, if you look at the most recent Mannheim Index, there really hasn't been very much movement. But if we were just thinking of it as a normal year, we would come out of January and head into the spring and expect some appreciation in the marketplace, probably into early summer, and then we would see a normal decline through the fall, if this is a normal year. But we don't like to make a lot of predictions about where the market is going to go, I think we have talked in the past about our ability to adjust and move and adapt to whatever the market brings to us, and we plan our inventory on a weekly basis. So what we are seeing right now in the wholesale marketplace is not really out of line with what we would have expected. Bill Armstrong : There is a lot of anticipation I guess of -- an influx of more supply of the wholesale coming from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins etcetera. Are you guys seeing a more plentiful supply when you go to auctions every week or not necessarily? Tom Folliard : Not necessarily. I mean, remember to that, leases that are originated in, I think lease percentages, is that a pretty high flip right now, somewhere around 30% in the industry. We won't see those cars for two or three years, so I think a lot of people look at lease percentages and think, oh you're going to see a big influx of cars, when its really two or three years down the road. And what we have seen in the past, and we have been at this for 20 years, and we have seen lease percentages in the 30, and we have seen lease percentages in the teens. What ends up happening is eventually those cars end up available for purchase, and we have done a nice job figuring how to have access to them. Bill Armstrong : Okay got it. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Morning everyone. Just a couple of questions. First, on the subprime pilot program. Just wanted to make sure that the extension doesn't really rule out a meaningful expansion of the program later, and can you highlight any specific areas that you feel need more time to evaluate versus what you were expecting earlier? Tom Reedy : Let me address the first, I think as I said, the results to-date are in line with what our initial expectations were. This is a different asset class for us, so we are interested in seeing how it performs, because its new to us, we are willing to be patient and ensure that we understand it completely, before we understand it completely before we do any sales. It does not rule out us doing a larger amount in the future. But if you remember, when we rolled this out a year ago, we said that there was three things we are looking for, one is learning, which we are definitely getting on that, I see that's going to benefit our business, whether or not we are in this space. But the other was a risk diversification play, and we have three partners in a subprime space who are doing an awesome job. Any decisions we make will be contemplating the impact on them, and I would not expect us to ever intend to be a full player in this space like we are in the prime space. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Tom Reedy : Probably as much color as I can give you about where our intentions have been. Ravi Shanker : Makes sense. And on competition, this is perhaps a more longer term strategy question, over the last 12 months, we have seen emergence of a few peer-to-peer user vehicle platforms that tried to pass on SG&A savings to customers, and show these new startups only in the few markets right now, but one can imagine them going after the high volume used markets first, where you and your peers already have a presence. So my question really is, what do you guys think about these new business models, versus the brick and mortar strategy in general? Tom Folliard : You know, we look at every part of competition, and in terms of peer-to-peer, one thing to remember is, that is a huge chunk of the market already and always has been. About a third of all cars sold in the U.S. are sold from consumer to consumer. Whether you sell a car by putting a sign in your yard or you list it online or you just put it in the newspaper or whatever you do. So that has always been a third. One could argue that, that's where those sales could come from since they are already happen, and it\u2019s just such a giant piece. It\u2019s by far the biggest piece -- the biggest percentage of cars sold are sold from peer-to-peer already. A lot of what we do in our off -- when we make a cash offer to every customer on every single car, I think we probably have tapped into that as well as anybody by getting some of those cars that maybe would have been sold peer-to-peer. But its something we keep a very close eye on, and we will watch very closely and see if there is an opportunity somewhere for us. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. On store openings, for the upcoming year, you have got definitely a skew towards existing markets over new, and I was just curious if longer term, are you going to look to focus more on growing existing over new/old or focus more on new later on? Tom Folliard : You know, its an ever changing landscape for us, as we continue to get more data in existing markets, it gives us more comfort with going back into those markets. But we have a healthy mix of new markets as well, and one thing to take into account; when we go into a metro market like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, or this year, we will be entering Boston, those are intentionally multiyear plays for us to really grow out the market. So when you see us go back into Philly with Turnersville, New Jersey store this year, that's just part of the long term Philadelphia plan. It looks like a skew towards an existing market, but those are existing markets that are clearly understored, and we are not where we expect to be long term. So I expect it to be a mix going forward. Some of the big ones that we have, coming in the next three years or so, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle are places where we have no presents. And it has taken us, I don't know, 15 years to get to 10 stores in LA, and you will see us continue to learn more, figure out places where we are -- zip codes where we are missing, and then try to figure out the best storing pattern to go into those bigger metro markets. So I don't read too much into that, because as I said, some of it is just planned, because the markets are bigger and more stores are required to fill them out. David Whiston : Okay. And on buybacks, it would be helpful for modeling if you could give any clarity on dollar spend for fiscal 2016? Tom Reedy : We don't give guidance on anything. But you can look at our release last fall, and it gives you an idea of the scale that we have, intentions for the longer term. Tom Folliard : But its also going to be a balance based on where we are trading, and what we think makes the most sense, and its something that we have a discussion with the board on a very regular basis and we have done with a programmatic fine schedule that we put a range around and we adjust it accordingly, based on the environment that we are operating in. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a follow-up question from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. James Albertine : Great, thanks. Just wanted to sneak one more in; given the harsh weather on a year-over-year basis, you may have lost some day sales, and maybe mixed your comp with even stronger, in retrospect. But just wanted to maybe ask for your -- kind of your view on the weather if you will? Tom Folliard : As you probably know James, we never like to use weather as an excuse, but it was really cold, and we did have a lot of stores closed, particularly in the back half of February. As far as attributing sales loss, we generally think we get it back, because when we are closed, everybody else is closed. It\u2019s not like milk, if you didn't sell it, you didn't sell it, or a grocer. It\u2019s such an infrequent purchase, where if we are closed, generally all the competition is closed as well. So I can attributed a specific sales loss to it, but we probably would have done a little better, if it wasn't so cold. We had a bunch of stores closed, particularly in the back half of February, but as I said, I think generally, we get those sales back. James Albertine : Very good. Thanks again. Tom Folliard : Okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey guys, thanks for letting me back in here. Just a quick follow-up; with energy prices being such a major investor topic today, I am curious for a big ticket purchase like autos, have you seen any notable change in some of the energy centric markets, like Texas? Tom Folliard : Well Scott, as you have learned over the years, we don't really talk about regional differences, so we are probably not going to start now. Scot Ciccarelli : Is there any color you could provide on that, just because it does kind of indicate some sort of overall big ticket demand, even if it doesn't really -- directly to your business, just kind of changing behavior at all? Tom Folliard : We didn't see much. S I mean, whether it\u2019s regional or -- I feel like we had a really good quarter and a really good year. We have gotten a lot of questions around gas prices and is it potential that lowering gas prices would drive sales towards kind of SUVs and V8s and we really didn't see much of that either. So I think possibly because we have such a wide range of inventory, and we appeal to such a broad range of customers, that some of those impacts are muted with us, but who knows. I also think, in terms of gas prices, that people do not expect gas to be this cheap, and a car is a long term purchase. So although you might see some shifting, it really hasn't affected us as much as you might think. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thanks Tom. Tom Folliard : We don't think prices are going to go back up. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Michael Levin : Hey guys, it\u2019s Mike Levin on for Rod. Just wanted to see if you could discuss some of the factors that went into you guys getting increased confidence in raising your store growth plans over the next three years, from 10 to 15 to 13 to 16? Tom Folliard : Sure. So if you recall coming out of the recession and getting back into a growth plan, we wanted to have a phase build-up. We wanted to make sure that we built up our infrastructure, and by infrastructure I mean, the ability to go out and source real estate, the ability to make sure that we provide experienced management into all these stores, where we spent a lot of dollars on relo, to make sure that first customer that walks in the door gets a great experience at CarMax, and our buildup over the few years, we opened three the first year, then five, then 10, then 13 for two years in a row. So this is kind of in line with continuing; as the base has also gotten bigger during that time. I think we have added 50 stores since 2011; increased the company size from 90-ish stores to 145 or so. And we opened 13 this year, and we plan on opening 14 next year, so it\u2019s right in the -- just kind of in the range of what we delivered, and we wanted to give ourselves some flexibility. These are big complicated stores, sometimes one or two might slip in or out every year. So we'd like to put a range about it, but we don't plan on opening 10 anymore, so we are -- that's kind of the range we can deliver over the next few years. So its confidence and all the things that I talked about, and that's the reason we raised the range. Michael Levin : That's great, and maybe just a follow-up; can you guys let us know how you're thinking about the pace of buybacks going forward with some of your increased capital plans? Tom Reedy : I think we hit on that a little earlier. As Tom mentioned, I think our goal was to be in it programmatically. If you look at what happened in Q4, we bought back a fewer shares and spent less dollars at an elevated stock price. So we put some buffers on our program based on our estimation of valuation. But in general, we want to be in the market on a continuous basis, and programmatically move towards a capital structure that's got a little more leverage unit; and I think you will see that over the next couple of years. Michael Levin : Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on the results. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : We also have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hey guys. Just wanted to follow-up on two things, one was inventory per store, which I had up kind of low double digits. So I was just trying to understand, how much of that might be anticipated build-out, as you increase the unit growth, versus like a desire to actually increased fill rates, and have more cars on the lot? And then secondly with CapEx going from $310 million to $360 million, can you just help to understand, how much of that is related to the remodels versus the new store acceleration and what the major markets are to spend there? Tom Reedy : Sure. What was your first question again? Inventory, yeah. So inventory in the quarter was up -- remember last year, we were behind on where we wanted to be, so some of it is, I would call it an easy comparison, because we were behind on inventory this year. We did a much better job of building, and we also had a bunch of new stores. So a lot of times when you look -- when we are in a build mode, we get a car done and saleable, we make it saleable in a store that finished it. So some stores have elevated inventory in the anticipation of a store opening, when we ship the cars over to the new store. So if you look at our total sales increase for the quarter, I think it was 12%, and you would expect inventory to go up kind of commensurate with that number, and then we had another -- during the quarter, 7% of compass, and I know inventory is slightly higher than when you add those two things together, but that I think is more of a reflection of -- we are a little behind of where we wanted to be last year. And then your second question -- Michael Montani : On the CapEx side, just understanding the step-up year-over-year in CapEx spend, how much is related to the new store openings increasing whereas remodels and the major buckets of spend in the $360 million? Tom Reedy : Yeah, the major buckets in the $360 million, roughly 80 of it would be on existing stores, 40 of that would be in normal maintenance, and the other 40 would be in the remodels that we talked about, and all the rest goes towards new stores. And remember, CapEx is always our best guess at the year. We have a lot of movement and a lot of timing during the year, particularly in new stores and new construction. So that's our best guess and what we will spend this year, and that's roughly the breakdown. Michael Montani : Great. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. Tom Folliard : All right. Thank you very much. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your continued support, and of course thanks to all of our more than 20,000 CarMax associates all over the country, for all they do everyday to make CarMax such a success. Thank you guys. Talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. We had a great first quarter, driven by strong performance in all our key businesses areas and with the continuation of our store opening plan. I'll give you some of the highlights for the quarter. Used unit comps increased by 4.9% and total used units grew by 9.3%. Gross profit per unit relatively flat at $2,200 compared to $2,220 in the first quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 4.7% and gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,032 was similar to $1,046 in the first quarter of last year. Other sales and revenues increased 14% year-over-year and CAF income grew 15% to approximately $109 million. I'll now turn over to Tom to talk about finance, Tom? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, all. Tom mentioned CAF income grew by 15% compared to first quarter of fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 17% to $8.7 billion. As mentioned in the release results for this quarter, we're again positively impacted by favorable loss experience at CAF. The weighted average contract rate, that rate we charge to the customers, was 7.4%, up slightly from last year's first quarter at 7.2%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $84 million or 0.94% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.2%. Half a point of that came from the loans originated under our subprime test, and that compares with 41.3% in last year's first quarter. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.4 billion due to the combination of CarMax unit sales growth and CAF's modestly higher penetration. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for about $120 million. That's down from the pace in recent quarters, reflecting the increase in stock price. Tom? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11.6% to $350 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of the first quarter of last year and a $7.9 million increase in share-based compensation expense. On a per unit basis, SG&A increased $51 to $2,098 compared to $2,047 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, $39 of which was related to the stock-based compensation expense. During the first quarter we opened three stores, two in new markets for CarMax, Minneapolis and Gainesville, Florida. We also opened our third store in the Philadelphia market. After the first quarter ended, we opened our third and fourth stores in the Denver market. That was actually yesterday, and added a second store in the Providence market. We plan to open one more store in the second quarter in Tallahassee, Florida, which will be a new market for us. Our comp unit sales were driven by improved conversion and continued growth in customer traffic. Our web traffic was up almost 10% compared to the same period last year. Monthly web visits grew to nearly 16 million. And now over 60% of our visits are coming from something other than a laptop and a desktop, so either a mobile device through our app or on a tablet. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, thanks for taking my question. This is more of a long-term question, but we have this view that millennials might respond to your hassle-free business model better than prior generations. I'm curious what CarMax is doing to target this group any differently, whether it's from a marketing perspective or what your technology spend might look like going forward. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a good question, Craig. We're in the middle of investing in continued capabilities on our website and mobile devices, and I don't think that's just for millennials. I think that's really for all consumers. If you look at consumer behavior over the last several years, it's clearly shifting towards wanting to do more and more of whatever shopping process they're involved in online. And we see that continuing to shift, and then within that, continuing to shift towards mobile. So we're working hard on our app and trying to have fantastic pictures on there. We've added zoom capability. We've added high-definition and zoom capability. We've given customers the ability to transfer a car from any store to any other store. We've given them the ability to pay for that online. If it's a paid transfer via credit card, they can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork online. And I think there's lots more to come there. It's just an ongoing process and trying to stay out in front of technology. But continued investments in the website and our mobile device I think will attract not only millennials, but other customers as well. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. Can you talk about subprime penetration? It still seems to be bouncing around a little bit and was down from 1Q last year. I guess what I'm wondering is how much of that drop is from business being picked up by Tier 2 lenders, and how much of that is maybe from some changes that the Tier 3 guys are making? Thanks. Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter. We've seen pretty stable performance from our Tier 3 lenders. If you look at what they're approving and the quality of their offers, it's been pretty consistent for the last several quarters. And as we've talked about, you've got to remember that their performance is a byproduct of both what they're doing on the credit front and what they're seeing coming through the pipeline. So I think it's fair to say that their behavior has been consistent and we're seeing a little bit more assertiveness in the Tier 2 space. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right, so no change in terms of thought process regarding the Tier 3 that they're probably just seeing less product because of the Tier 2 activity. Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I can't speak for them, but if you look at credit quality of applications this quarter, it's up about two points year over year. That moves the mix a little bit. And I think we've done a lot of work to build a good stable of Tier 2 lenders that each brings something different from the table from a credit perspective, and that adds incremental sales. So like I said, I think we're happy with the performance of our Tier 3 lenders. I think that we see consistent aggressiveness out of them in the last several quarters. I wouldn't attribute it to anything but some things moving around. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So just to be clear, when the Tier 2 guys that needed taking up some share, we should assume that's a much more profitable transaction for you, correct? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. As you know, we pay $1,000 per car in the Tier 3 space and we make $300 a car from the lender in the Tier 2 space. So every time we are shifting that volume, we're taking loan from $1,000 out-of-pocket to $300 in. So yeah, it's good. And you saw that reflected in the other margin this quarter. Our third-party finance net income, which is actually an expense, was actually flat year-over-year with 9% sales growth and that's a direct result of the mix of Tier 3 being a little bit lower. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you, many thanks. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Scot, as you know, one of our main goals at CarMax is to make sure that when customers show up at the store that they have access to credit and we always talk about global approval rating which is of applicants, how many get an approval from one of our lenders starting with CAF and then heading down through all of our other partners. And that number is over 90%. So we're pretty pleased with the credit offering that we have for our customers when they show up at the store, whether it's through CAF or one of our partners. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. All right, thanks a lot guys. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning. So I have a question, a follow-up that I'll kind of shove into one here. The question on the buyback and Tom, you discussed this a bit in your prepared comments, maybe an explanation why we saw a lower buyback never heard in Q1 versus the prior quarters. But can you give us a little more color there on how you're thinking about that buyback relative to the stock price? And maybe how should we consider the cadence of buybacks in coming quarters... Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't really want \u2013 we're not really going to be in a position to get into what we're going to do in future quarters, but I can tell you that our intentions are very much that it's a priority for us to return capital to shareholders, and as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, to move our capital structure towards where there's a little bit more leverage in it. And that is something we're committed to do over the medium to long term. In any given quarter, we might see some bouncing around, because rather than having a trading mentality, we're trying to take a programmatic approach to buying back stock. We've set up a program and we let it run for a period of time. That program's going to have guidelines in it that allows for more share repurchase at lower stock prices and dialing it back as the stock goes up. So \u2013 and we just kind of look at it from a longer-term perspective. We'll adjust those parameters as is appropriate going forward, but that's pretty much as much as I can say about it. We had a program in place that dials back at higher stock prices. We saw the stock price increase significantly over the last several months. And as time goes forward, we'll adjust it as appropriate, but keeping an eye on the fact that we do want to keep making progress towards more leverage in the capital structure. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it, that's helpful. And then my follow-up question, unrelated. Just an update from a marketing perspective. Are you still list \u2013 is CarMax still listing cars on Autotrader.com and Cars.com? Is that still a marketing vehicle you utilize? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this time it's not, Brian. We have gone on and off testing with Cars.com and Autotrader.com, and we'll continue to test on whatever listing sites that add incremental sales and that are worth the investment. With the growth in carmax.com up to 16 million hits a month, we're a pretty prominent website, particularly in all the markets that we operate in, and we haven't found that there is incremental value there. So at this time, we're mostly just using our own website. We are continuing to test, but we don't have any cars on Cars.com or Autotrader.com at this time. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks a lot. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, I guess just two really quick questions. Tom, can you talk about why average selling price is down? I don't think I've ever seen that before at CarMax. And then secondarily, the stock comp, the $7.9 million, is there going to be accelerated stock comp all year, and how do we think about that and the G&A line? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the first part, I think we were down \u2013 well, I'm getting the number here \u2013 I think we were down a couple of hundred bucks. And I'm with you, Sharon, I don't generally expect ASPs to go down, so I don't have a great explanation for it. I think lower prices are better for our customers. I don't think it really is an indication of much of anything because the move was so modest. What was it last quarter? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : $100. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We were roughly flat last quarter. I think we're up $100. So I haven't really read too much into it. It's such a small change in price. And then your second question, Sharon? Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: The stock comp, I think you had $7.9 million of incremental stock compensation this quarter. I'm just kind of trying to figure out if there's accelerated stock compensation all year, how we should think about that and G&A? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's largely going to be driven by how the stock performs. And a big chunk of that is in our restricted stock units that go to the vast majority of the associates who are in the equity program largely in our stores. And that's a cash-settled expense for us, and it's subject to variable accounting. So this is going to be largely based on how the stock performs and a number of other factors. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo. Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just piggyback on Craig's question around mobile and web capabilities. Just wondering if you can give us an update on the EasyShop program and what we can expect in terms of future web capabilities over the next year or two. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Matt, so that was a \u2013 we originally called that out as a test. And EasyShop was a branded thing \u2013 excuse me, within the website. We're really not calling it that anymore. It's now really just expanded capabilities throughout the website, and we'll continue to test those capabilities. And when we find something that works, we'll roll it to the whole chain. And so the things I mentioned earlier, the ability to transfer a car, the ability to pay for a car, the ability to make an appointment, the ability to put a car on hold remotely, all those things are rolled throughout the company now, but we stopped branding it. We just realized it worked better as just part of the capability of our normal website. I really can't give you what I think the other things will be that \u2013 the capabilities that we'll add going forward, other than we're working really hard to try and make sure that customers can do whatever part of the transaction that they want to do from home, we want to make sure we give them that capability. So that's kind of where we're focusing. We want to improve their experience. We want to make sure we have the best search engine, we want to make sure we have the best touch screen experience, and we want to make sure we have the best mobile experience. And the other thing I would say is we need to hold ourselves to a standard of the experiences that people have in other parts of their lives and not just their experience that they have when they're shopping for a car. So the bar has definitely been raised as it relates to experiences online and experiences with mobile devices, but we're working real hard to stay out in front of it. Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just a quick follow-up. I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick update on the small-store, small-market format. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think we mentioned we were going to open five stores, read the results for some period of time, and then evaluate our plan going forward. On the last call, I mentioned that we feel very confident in the way we've performed so far. And if you look at our growth plans going forward, the 13 to 16 stores over the next few years, embedded in that will be small-format stores. So we've identified right now at least 80 markets that meet that criteria, and that will be part of our regular growth program going forward. Last month, the store that I mentioned in Gainesville, Florida is a little bit of a hybrid. It has a small-format front end, which means we operate it with the overhead structure that we've created for the small-format stores, but we have a full production shop in the back. So we're always going to be working on our formats and try to find out what's the most efficient way to want to run a store at various volumes. And we have incredible variation and incredible capabilities as a company to be able to go after just about any market now. We can open a market with selling as few as 75 cars a month, and we can run stores that sell as many as 1,000 cars a month. So I'm really proud of what we've accomplished in being able to address all kinds of different market sizes. Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : It sounds like they're working. That's great news, thanks so much. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot. My primary question relates to the wholesale business. Obviously, units will show volatility from time to time, and the profitability of the wholesale business was terrific. But the unit growth and the ratio of wholesale to used sold was a little bit lower than we had seen. So any insights as to what drove that this quarter and how you're thinking about the wholesale business generally this year? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Matt, I've talked about this a number of times. I really don't worry about the wholesale business in any given quarter. We think about it over a very long period of time. If you look at it over a long period of time, it has essentially grown with unit sales. We're not worried at all that it's \u2013 it grew 5%. I'm glad that it grew 5%. It's a very, very big business for us. It's a very profitable business for us. It requires an incredible amount of effort in the stores. You think about every time we open up a new production store. And even in a new market, we've got to run another business within it. We have to have great customer service. We have to attract dealers to our auctions every day, and we have to give those dealers a great experience because they have other choices and they can go other places. So again, it's a big business. It grew 5% in the quarter, not quite what the retail growth was. But as you've been following us for a long time, you've seen that number dramatically in the other direction as well sometimes. So we're really thinking about that business over the long haul. And also, as you know, that business is not an independent business. It's attached to retail. Almost all the cars sold in wholesale are direct acquisitions from consumers, many of those who are buying cars from us, so we have to make sure that we're competitive. So I was very pleased with the quarter for wholesale. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And, Katharine, hopefully you won't count this follow-up as an actual question. But just the stock comp, you have \u2013 you now disclose three or four sub-categories within SG&A. Does the stock comp number spread amongst the four of them, or is it focused in compensation? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's all in compensation. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you so much, guys. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Matt, one more point on that. Almost all the variability in our stock-based compensation expense is non-executive comp, just to make that point. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And it seems like, since you offered, it seems like on a per-vehicle basis, when you exclude stock comp, the delta was actually quite favorable, pretty well controlled year on year. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly. And remember, carrying \u2013 that's with 16 more stores in the base than were there last year, which as you know, in the early part of their life story is very SG&A inefficient until they grow to where we expect them to grow. And we've always said, we think we need mid to high single-digit comps to get some leverage there. I was really pleased with the way SG&A ran during the quarter. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask first off on vehicle demographics, if you could share the penetration of zero to four-year-old vehicles. I think it was 75% last quarter and growing pretty nicely. So could you just update us there on what you're seeing? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: For the quarter, it was 76%. And you mentioned 75% was in the fourth quarter, and that's on top of 73% the year prior. So I think pre-recession, that number was 85%, and then coming out of the recession it was 70%. So yes, we've seen some shifting back towards. We've been expecting this with the shifting in supply, with the change in the SAAR. But from quarter to quarter, it was relatively flat from the fourth quarter to this quarter. Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI : Thanks. And just to follow up on that, if I could, you mentioned that the buy rate was a little bit lower this quarter. Can you just share with us what's going on to drive that? Is there anything from a pricing dynamic that's impacting you in any way there, and also what the penetration is of retail used units that were from the appraisal lane this quarter? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was still a pretty good number. We're buying around 30%. That's pretty good for us. It's modest fluctuations in the buy rate. We called it out only because it was there, but it's not something that I really can add any color to because I don't think there was much to it. Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. This is actually Liz Suzuki on for John. With the loan charge-off rates running lower than expected, do you think half would be comfortable taking on a little more risk in expanding that sub-prime test even further? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think the two are actually unrelated. We're looking at the subprime test almost as a different line of business with a different pool of credit. And as we've talked about before, we're constantly testing within our core CAF business different pockets of credit, both pricing and what we'll approve on an ongoing basis. And to the extent it makes sense and we keep the profile of the portfolio intact, then we'll roll those things out. As far as the current environment having an impact on that, these are anywhere from five to six-year loans. And I think the results in any one quarter or a couple of quarters aren't going to \u2013 aren't anything to go out and swing your credit policy for what you're going to be collecting in five years. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That makes sense. What do you attribute those lower loss rates to this quarter? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The losses are really a combination of how many people are going bad and how many \u2013 how well we're doing recovering funds from those loans that have gone bad. And we've had some success in doing a little bit better on the recovery side, but the vast majority of what we're seeing in loss performance is that just fewer people are going bad. And I think that's not inconsistent with what's going on in the lending industry in general right now, at least, at the higher credit level. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. I had a quick question on the direct operating expenses within CAF. You've done a very nice job of managing it over time. But it seemed to slow a little bit in Q4, but now in Q1, came back down a percentage of AR. So I want to think about how you manage that over time as you continue to grow your book. And two, if the subprime test proves successful, like what does that mean for your direct expenses within CAF? Thank you. Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We try to manage those expenses over time as efficiently as we can. Unfortunately, it's not only our activity that impact that. And so if you think about what's entailed in the finance business, there's a lot of activity contacting customers. If you're in an environment where people are less delinquent and there's fewer losses that \u2013 and fewer people not paying, which we are today, that means you're making less calls. It probably needs less resource to do that. If the world changes and you got to pay more attention and be making more calls, that will have an impact on your costs. But I think the team down at CAF has done a great job of getting more efficient in both those types of environments, and we'll try to continue to do so. And as far as Tier 3, as we roll that out, to the extent we roll that out, you would expect that it's a more high-touch business and it would have some impact on CAF's overhead costs. But we're not at a point where we can forecast that for you. Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, cool. Thanks, guys. Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton of KeyBanc. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. It's actually Irina Hodakovsky up for Brett Hoselton. A quick question for you, guys, on the used vehicle sourcing. We've been expecting an acceleration in off-lease supply to drive that supply of zero to four-year-old car inventory. And what I'm seeing is on the industry reports, on the certified vehicle sales, we're seeing double-digit increase through March, 11% up, and your increase is substantially below that. And I'm wondering if you are not getting those cars yet or if there is some sort of a bottleneck in inventory supply, or any commentary you can give us on what you're seeing in terms of zero to four-year-old vehicle supply coming in. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You can't just look at CPO by itself. You have to look at total comps for the industry. If you look at the average of all the publicly traded new car dealers, used comps during the first quarter were at 5%, so about in line with where we were. Within that is where you see the growth in CPO, so there is a distinction there that you have to make. Lease percentage right now, I think, in the new car industry is somewhere around 30%. And when you see that supply coming back is really two years and three years later after you see a high lease percentage. So I'm not sure that we've seen much of it yet, but it's never been a problem for us to source cars. And when cars are at a high lease percentage, when you look out two years and three years later, generally, they're more organized at the auction, so it's a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace. But we really haven't seen lease percentage change our ability to source cars over time, and we've been at this for over 20 years. So we actually think it's not a bad thing at all that there's a higher percentage of leases right now. And over the next two years or three years, that'll give us more access to those cars. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of C.L. King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Your weighted average contract rate for CAF was 7.4% versus 7.2% a year ago. Was there a mix going on there or are you seeing overall interest rates that you're getting from consumers starting to go up? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I wouldn't really read too much into that much of a lift. But as I've said, we've been in environments where rates are going down. We always want to make sure we're standing with the market; and in environments where we went to \u2013 rates going up, we want to be tested as well. So we have been doing some tests with increased rates in certain pockets, but like I said, I wouldn't read much into the difference in the \u2013 the weighted average contract is pretty consistent. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And remember, we're very market-driven with a three-day guarantee for our customers to go get a better loan somewhere else and we unwind it free of cost. So that is a kind of a check and balance on how much rate we can actually get out of our consumers. But we think it's a huge competitive advantage that not only CarMax Auto Finance, but all of our other lenders as well, provide customers that opportunity to go get a better deal somewhere else, if they'd like, in the first three business days and get out of it at no cost whatsoever. So it's a good check and balance, but it's a great offering for the consumer. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Right, understood, and then just a quick follow-up. Could you tell us what your originations were for the quarter for your CAF subprime test? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's about $15 million. As we talked about at the end of last year, we're comfortable continuing at that pace of about 5% of the Tier 3 originations. I think we're just under $90 million in total originations to-date now. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay, thank you. Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin of Deutsche Bank. Mike L. Levin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Just to kind of follow up on CAF. We've been expecting to see the collateral spreads kind of tighten gradually over time, but the last three quarters would be kind of holding steady at about 6.3%. Does this kind of feel like a near-term equilibrium that you guys are seeing, or would you expect to see some contraction as we kind of move forward and the Fed moves rates? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think you hit the nail on the head. We're going to \u2013 it's going to depend on what goes on with rates. As we've talked about before, our ability to manage that spread is very much market-driven. And to the extent we see cost of funds going up with \u2013 because benchmarks are moving up, we'll clearly test and see what we can manage that spread to, but it's going to be driven by what the market will bear and what our competitors are doing, and what makes sense for the customer. So it's very hard to speculate on it. We have seen spread compression if you look year over year. We just managed to outgrow that from an income perspective with growth in the portfolio overall, some larger originations in those prior years, and some favorable loss performance the recent quarters. Mike L. Levin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. The CFPB now oversees the large non-bank auto finance and provided CAF I assume is under their jurisdiction. Are there any changes required from an operating standpoint or a cost standpoint now that you've got this oversight? Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think the short answer is yes, we do expect there to be greater cost in administration. Now the flipside of that is the announcement last week didn't tell us anything new from what we've been planning for quite some time. As we've expected all along, capital will be subject to the bureau's supervisory authority as a larger participant. The definition of larger participant isn't really that large. It's about 10,000 loans a year in originations. So the vast majority of auto lenders are subject to it. But I think what it means for us is we're going to continue, as we have been, to refine our compliance program and meet the bureau's expectation. We're paying careful attention to industry developments and looking at our practices. Every time we see it, we learn more about what the bureau is interested in and making sure that we're doing our best to comply with what we think they want to see. But in answer to your question, there and going to be some administrative costs around that just, like we expect with the Dodd-Frank Reg AB II. With the extended reporting requirements, it will be a cost of doing business, and we'll let you know what it is if it's material when the time comes. N. Richard Nelson - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. Thanks, good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Seth. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My question is around conversion. Tom, you mentioned improved conversion helping comps. But how do those levels of improvement compared to recent quarters? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's another one that's been pretty volatile over time. And I still think of it as you have to look at it over a much longer period of time. And I've always felt that over time, we would get our comp sales improvement from a combination of traffic and conversion. So there have been quarters where conversion has outpaced traffic, and there have been quarters where traffic has outpaced conversion. In this particular quarter, we said it was divided between the two to deliver the 5% comp, but there's volatility in both of those things and I expect it to be volatile going forward, but I think over a long period of time I expect to get improvements out of both. So I'm not sure I really answered your question, but I can tell you we've had quarters where conversion improvement has been higher than this quarter, but we've had some quarters where we've been flat or behind as well. So really you have to look at it over a much longer period of time. I don't think one quarter is a good proxy for the long term, although in this quarter we had a little from both. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got you. Just as a follow-up maybe, is there anything you can point to in terms of the trends in conversion rates in certain sectors of your customer population, whether it be credit tiers or otherwise and whether or not inventory levels are affecting conversion, those types of things? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a really good question. We spend a lot of time trying to figure that out and we don't have a lot of success. So I'd say it comes from all kinds of different areas. There's an argument that people are more prepared when they show up at the store because they've spent more time on our website. There's an argument for more inventory for selection for the customer. You can clearly see impacts from movements in credit that impact conversion as well. We have extensive training programs going on in our stores in all areas of the company, which I think help conversion of course. We can buy cars a little bit better, have the right selection at individual stores even without having more cars. So we always say around here conversion is a very big word and it includes lots of things. So I really can't attribute specific points to any one of them. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right, very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar Research : Thanks, good morning, more of a strategic question for you. We're in a rather robust part of the economic cycle, and I'm sure you're always optimistic about all phases of the company. But in particular, given where we are in the cycle, what parts of your business you think you're most excited about over let's say the next 12 months? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As you said, we're excited about all parts of our business. I think for me it's two things. It's the ability to continuously improve our existing store base, which has gotten quite large, and then our ability to enter new markets successfully, whether they're small markets or medium-sized markets or metro markets, and then to be able to deliver a consumer offer that has all kinds of advantages against the competition that allow us to continue to succeed. So I'm really excited about the core business. In the last several months, I visited lots of ours stores that have been around for 15 and 20 years, some are hitting all-time highs in sales. And then I've been to some of our new grand openings, and it always gets me excited to see how engaged people are to come and work for CarMax and deliver a great consumer offer. So again, for me it's continuing to grow the existing stores and then being able to go after new markets as well. David Whiston - Morningstar Research : That's helpful. And then just one other question. It's been tax refund time recently. I'm just curious, did you see a meaningful uptick in business with these other tax refund seasons or is it a little down or flat? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're really well past tax refund season now. For us, that's January, February, March timeframe. And over the last couple of years, we've seen some volatility around timing from just tax refunds, in general. But whatever you would've seen from tax refunds, you would've already seen in our business through the fourth quarter and then now that the first quarter is over. So it's always a big-time year for us particularly coming out of the winter and we had a big year this year as well. David Whiston - Morningstar Research : Okay, thank you. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain of Morgan Stanley. Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the question on millennials and tech. CarMax has always led with technology and transparency in this business, but there is some serious money being spent by these peer-to-peer business models and they're gaining a lot of traction in millennials as well. And we've talked about this earlier and you said you're keeping a close eye on these models. And while you may not see them as direct competitors, is that an opportunity missed or is it something who can push you in the near future? And if so how quickly you can do that? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a good question and I have the same answer as before. We're keeping a close eye on it and we'll decide if that's something we need to go after. As of this moment, we're not heading down the peer-to-peer path. But if you really think about the way CarMax works, the fact that we make a cash offer on every car is enabling a lot of peer-to-peer transactions and some of those are coming through us that would have otherwise gone peer-to-peer. So a customer who normally would have put their car online and be \u2013 or have put up in their yard and put a for-sale sign on it, now they're bringing a lot of those customers. They're bringing their cars directly to us and sell it to us. So it may not be exactly the way you're thinking of it, but I think we're getting plenty of customers who would have gone through the peer-to-peer channel and are deciding to sell their car directly to CarMax. Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very well. And just a quick follow-up, would you rule out an acquisition of that kind in this space or would you do it organically? Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're evaluating all different options and we're open to any way that makes our business better and delivers a better return for our shareholders. Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel Nicolaus. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping and I apologize if I missed it in prepared remarks or another question, I dialed in a few minutes late. But hoping to get an update on the vehicle transfer activity, so the propensity for consumers to order a vehicle from outside their home market and have it shipped to their closest store. And then as a follow-up, any insight you could provide near term on sort of retail activity, particularly given some of the storms and flooding that we've been hearing in the Texas and sort of southern regions? Thanks. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So on the first question, that number has been around 30% for quite a long time now. But that's a big number. We sold 600,000 cars last year, which means we transfer roughly 200,000 cars at the customer's request to the store near them and then sold the car. So we're transferring as many cars or more than anybody else at the customer's request when they see a great presentation of that car through our website. With 40 high-definition pictures and zoom capability, I think we'll continue to make progress there, but the number has been relatively flat. But again, it's a very, very big number. In terms of our regional differences, we never comment on regional differences. The only thing I'd tell you is I continue to be very proud of our CarMax team whenever we have a disaster in any area that involves large-scale loss of products. We're able to be there for the consumer when they are ready to buy something else. And we also are a place where people can get rid of their cars, whether they \u2013 if a car is flood-damaged or hail damaged, we still make an offer on the car. We turn around and wholesale that car. We won't retail one of those cars, but we still are there for the consumer when they need us in markets that have some trouble. But I can't really comment on any differences in performance. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks again. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks. Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, being there are no further questions, I want to thank everybody for your interest in CarMax and for joining us on the call today. And I especially want to thank our over 22,000 CarMax associates nationwide for all you do every day to make CarMax such a success. And we'll talk to you guys next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today.  As you saw, we had a record second quarter due to the continued growth in our store base and solid performances in used and wholesale unit sales, as well as CarMax auto finance. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter : used unit comps increased by 4.6% and total used units rose by 9.2%. Gross profit per unit was flat at $21.66 compared to $21.73 in the second quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 8.7% partially driven by one more auction date in the quarter compared to last year. Without the additional day of auctions, wholesale units would have grown about 5%. Gross profit per wholesale unit of $951 grew nearly 9% compared to $874 in the second quarter of last year, and CAF income grew 6% to approximately $98 million. I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to give you some more details on finance. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew 6.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and average managed receivables grew by 16% to $9 billion, or just under $9 billion. The weighted average contract rate - the rate charged to customers - was at 7.2%, up slightly from last year\u2019s second quarter of 7.0%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $88 million or 0.96% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.7%, half a point of which came from loans originated under our sub-prime test. That compares with 40.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter, of which 0.6% related to loans originated under that test. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 14% to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration at CAF. Finally, during the second quarter we repurchased 3.9 million shares for about $250 million. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. This quarter, our comp unit sales were driven by improved conversion achieved by our store teams. Our total web traffic increased nearly 12% compared to the same period last year, and now approximately 65% of our visits are coming from something other than a laptop or a desktop. As for our sales mix this quarter, zero to four-year-old vehicles increased by 5% to 79% of our total sales, and SUVs and trucks were down slightly from 24% to 22% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. For SG&A, excluding the $21 million reduction in last second quarter\u2019s SG&A due to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds, SG&A for this second quarter increased approximately 4% to $331 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of second quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in share-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis, excluding the settlement gain, SG&A decreased $100 to $2,083. The stock-based compensation expense decrease accounted for $78 of that leverage. During the second quarter, we opened four stores, three in existing markets : one in Providence and two in Denver, and a small format store in Tallahassee, which is a new market for CarMax. After the second quarter ended, we opened two more stores, our sixth store in the Houston market and our second store in Minneapolis, and we also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg.  Also during the quarter, we notified Nissan that we would terminating our new car franchise at White Marsh, which is just outside of Baltimore, and we notified Chrysler that we would be terminating our new car franchise at our Norcross store in Atlanta. Both terminations will become effective in the third quarter. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Tom Folliard : Hi Brian. Brian Nagel : So my question, I wanted to focus on the used car unit comp. If I look at the number, in my view, the 4.6% you put in was very respectable given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere from other dealers, or even other retailers. But Tom, as you look at the data, so maybe take a step back from the data, and you had a 4.6 here in Q2, a 4.9 in Q1, and it was only a few quarters before that used car unit comps are tracking upwards of--you know, in the upper single digits. Is there something to explain as you look at the data this kind of downshift we\u2019ve seen in the trend there? Tom Folliard : You know, Brian, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s something to explain. We have very big stores, average volume of 320 cars a month. I\u2019m very pleased with a 4.6% comp in one of our--you know, the first and second quarter are our two highest volume quarters of the year. At the same time, we\u2019re building stores, continuing to refine our model, continuing to develop our website and our apps so our customers have a better experience, and our store teams continue to execute very, very well. So you know, I don\u2019t spend too much time--we don\u2019t spend too much time trying to analyze a couple of points here or there in a quarter when you\u2019re building a business over a very long period of time, so we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the business in the quarter. Brian Nagel : Got it. If I can just follow up on that, as we think about--I mean, partially you\u2019ve already answered this, but as we think about the third and fourth quarters, where the comparisons at least on a single-year basis get more difficult, is that something that you manage around in any way? Tom Folliard : You know, as you know, we don\u2019t give any guidance, any forward-looking guidance, but I will tell you that when we look at the business each year and over a long period of time, a lot of our trending analysis is going to take into account whatever the factors were in the years prior. So it matters what the comps were the year before, but it only matters in our forecasting at the beginning of the year. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : Morning everyone. Tom Folliard : Hi Matt. Matt Nemer : So just to follow up on Brian\u2019s question, I\u2019m just curious if the later Labor Day holiday this year potentially impacted the result. I would assume--it looked like August was a bit of a tougher month from a unit standpoint for the auto industry and that some of those sales had shifted to September. Tom Folliard : You know, it\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t really look at it--I mean, we don\u2019t really think of it in that level of detail. To me, Labor Day was in the third quarter last year and it was in the third quarter this year, so the only real difference would be the Saturday and Sunday of Labor Day compared to the year prior. So there might have been something in there, but we don\u2019t really consider it. We don\u2019t consider it to be any factor in the quarter, or we maybe would have called it out. Matt Nemer : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Then just as a follow-up, your advertising expense was up about 18% year-over-year. Combined with the recent NFL affiliations, I\u2019m just wondering if this signals a change in strategy and perhaps we could see some higher ad expense per vehicle on a go-forward basis. Tom Folliard : You know, our sales are up a little over 9%, so if we had just flat advertising per car, the expense would have been up 9%. It was up 18%. A good portion of the difference between those two is we actually had ad production during the quarter, and we did not have ad production during the quarter last year. That\u2019s a big chunk of it.  Another big chunk of it is we\u2019ve outsourced our media buying, so some of those dollars have just moved from one bucket to the other, where we used to have that not in SG&A but in corporate overhead. So there\u2019s not really much to read into in terms of this quarter. In terms of the affiliations with sports teams, we have gotten bigger. We are entering some big metro markets, but none of that expense would have really showed up in the second quarter because they are only starting now. We have a big launch in Denver, as you know. We have two stores that we had prior to this year, we added two more. We have a fifth store in Colorado Springs - that\u2019s a big market for us. In terms of New England and the Boston market, we have two stores in the Hartford market, we have two stores in the Providence, Rhode Island market. In December of this year, we\u2019ll launch Boston officially and we\u2019ll have three stores, one in Danvers, one in Norwood, and one in Westborough. We\u2019re continuing to look at sites. We own a site in Portland, Maine. We\u2019re looking in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire, so when we think about New England as a broad market, we have a huge investment coming there over the next several years, and as you know, Matt, Boston is a little bit of a sports town and you really have to try and connect with your customer base. I think that affiliating yourself with at least one of the sports teams is something you need to do. We also just announced a partnership with University of Minnesota as we\u2019re opening up the Minneapolis market, where we opened up our second store there.  So we\u2019ve done some sports marketing in the past. I think this got a little bit more press because it was a little bit bigger, but as a company we\u2019ve gotten a lot bigger too. Matt Nemer : Sounds good. Looks like based on your store openings that either the Raiders or the 49ers are going to be next. Tom Folliard : Well, the Raiders beat the Ravens, so maybe they\u2019re not as bad as everyone thinks. Matt Nemer : Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : Hey guys, good morning. Can you give us a little bit of the lay of the land of new competitors as you see it, and also kind of where you sit and handicap yourself on your own ecommerce capabilities, your internet site? What again are the capabilities that you believe you\u2019ve got that are virtuous to you, and what capabilities do you really need to still work on and when do you think you\u2019re going to start attacking some of those? Tom Folliard : So I don\u2019t know that we have anything that\u2019s just virtuous to us where nobody else can do it. It\u2019s a free market, and what we are trying to do is make sure our customers can do as much of the transaction as they want to do from home. We\u2019ve definitely seen the sentiment shift where customers are looking to do more and more research, more and more pieces of the transaction from home, and in some cases the entire transaction from home. Our current capabilities are our customer can obviously do all kinds of inventory searches. We have 50,000 cars online - I think that\u2019s a huge competitive advantage for us, is the selection of inventory and the ability to transfer our cars at the customer\u2019s request, and as you know, Aram, that\u2019s about a third of our total sales. We also give the customer the ability to put a car on hold. We give the customer the ability to transfer a car. If it\u2019s a paid transfer, they can do it with a credit card without speaking to anybody and have that car transferred to the store of their choice. They can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork from home. We have tested online credit applications, and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities there. We\u2019ve seen some start-ups and some smaller competitors that are doing kind of beginning-to-end transactions online. I don\u2019t think anybody is in a better position than we are to be able to do those things, and those are some of the things that we\u2019ll continue to work on and continue to evaluate as our business grows. But I think we have a bunch of significant advantages. The one I mentioned which I think is the most significant is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company, last year we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000, but cars moving from store to store, moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network of and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer\u2019s request. But I think we need to keep working on our app, we need to keep working on our capabilities, and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer and give them the capability to do what they want to do from home. Aram Rubinson : Thanks Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Two questions, I guess. Tom, there are a lot of investors that seem to be concerned about off-lease vehicles and what\u2019s going to happen there, and that this time might be different than prior years where there were a lot of off-lease vehicles. Can you kind of give us your perspective on how CarMax has done in years where there have been a lot of off-lease vehicles coming up, and whether or not your ability to procure those vehicles is any different than it would have been, say, 10 years ago? Tom Folliard : Yeah, that\u2019s a good question, Sharon. I don\u2019t remember exactly, because remember that the supply comes back two, three years after the lease rate is at whatever it is. Right now, it\u2019s pretty high - I think it\u2019s in the high 20s as a percent of new car sales. I\u2019ve always said before, cars tend to come back whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable but at a somewhat predictable rate as the years roll forward. When it\u2019s a very high lease percentage, it\u2019s kind of more predictable, so if there\u2019s a bunch of leases going out now, if it\u2019s almost 30% of new cars sales, two years out, three years out we\u2019re going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to. In terms of our capabilities, we are much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We\u2019re much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we\u2019re in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all the analytics that we\u2019ve put into it and all the digital capabilities that we\u2019ve given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We\u2019re tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at at the auction and deciding whether or not that car is worthy, and then the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don\u2019t have to look at that same car and we\u2019re saving an enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic card, and we can analytically decide where those cars go later.  If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store-by-store basis, so I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think--I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you\u2019ll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it\u2019s pretty predictable and we have the ability to look at that inventory in advance and decide which ones we are or are not going to bid on. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Then a question for the other Tom - obviously the leverage on SG&A this quarter was largely related to the share-based comp decline. Can you talk about in the back half of the year what kind of comp you need to hold your SG&A? Tom Reedy : I think what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, Sharon, is we need kind of a mid-single digit comp to get SG&A leverage. If you look at this quarter, I think we levered about $23 if you back out the stock-based comp. There is some timing going on there, so I feel like at the comps we\u2019re at this quarter, we are right at the inflection point or thereabouts. When I say some timing, I think there is some favorability in prior years that I wouldn\u2019t give us a huge amount of credit for leveraging this quarter. So we\u2019re still in growth mode, I think we\u2019re still in the same mind that we need comps about this or a little north of it to get meaningful leverage. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a regulatory question. I\u2019m curious if the government were to pass some law requiring CarMax to fix recalls, would you be able to seek reimbursement from the OEM in the same way that a franchise dealer would? Tom Folliard : The way we would do it is the cars would go to the franchise dealer, and the franchise dealer would fix them under warranty and then they would get reimbursed for it, and then we would go back and get the car. We are not authorized to do repairs of any kind that run through the warranty system, and that\u2019s the category that recalls fall under, so for us it would be--we would have to take the car to a franchise dealer where it would repaired, and they would get reimbursed and we would get the car back, but it would be at no cost to us. Craig Kennison : Got it. Then just following up on that, Volkswagen has a big recall they\u2019ve announced. What\u2019s your exposure overall to Volkswagen vehicles? Thanks. Tom Folliard : You know, the Volkswagen, which just came out so we\u2019re really still just evaluating it. It only relates to diesel product. We have about-- I mentioned earlier we have about 50,000 cars online. We have only a couple of hundred diesel products, Volkswagens or Audis, so very, very small. Craig Kennison : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Tom Folliard : Hi Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Tom, you talked about or highlighted that conversion rates drove the comp. Does that imply that traffic did not contribute to the comp this quarter? Tom Folliard : It does, and as I\u2019ve said before, Scot, I never focus on one quarter\u2019s traffic or conversion. I always feel like, and it has been true over a very long period of time, I feel like our comps will be driven roughly half and half by traffic increases and conversion increases over time, and that has been true for a very long period of time. I think it will be true going forward, so in any given quarter, and it has happened in the past, our comps could be driven by just traffic increases and no conversion increases, or vice versa. This is a quarter where our store teams did a great job of converting the customers that they had in addition to constantly optimizing our finance offer and all the other things that go into conversion - buying the right product, having it at the right store at the right time. That\u2019s what delivered our comps this quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : I know you guys don\u2019t typically give a lot of detail regarding kind of trends during the quarter, but taking a look at geography, did you see anything noticeable? I mean, obviously you have a lot of exposure to Texas, for instance, which is starting to have maybe some issues in certain areas just because of all the energy-related exposure there. Tom Folliard : Yeah, you were right at the beginning, Scot - we don\u2019t give any guidance or trending during the quarter, or market-specific data. Scot Ciccarelli : All right, you can\u2019t blame a guy for trying. Last question is-- Tom Folliard : It\u2019s probably the eighth or ninth time you\u2019ve asked in 10 years, so. Scot Ciccarelli : I know. I keep trying, right? Is there anything you could put your finger on that drove the gross profit dollars per unit on the wholesale side? I mean, it was a pretty big spike, and I know there is some natural volatility to that category, but I was just wondering if there was anything you could point to this particular quarter. Tom Folliard : You know, as I\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s not a--we sell cars to the top bidder, so it\u2019s not a manageable business for us within a very--I mean, it is within a narrow range, obviously, because we\u2019ve been able to do it, but within $50 or so, it kind of comes out the way it does If you look at the first quarter this year, it was, I think, right around $1,000, so we have normally a little seasonal drop in margin per car from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that\u2019s what I would say--I would look at it more sequentially than I would year-over-year. So we came off of $1,000 in the first quarter, and we\u2019re down to $950 in the second quarter. Last year\u2019s sequential drop was a little bit steeper, but I didn\u2019t see anything unusual there. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. All right, thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning. My primary question relates to SUVs. You disclosed the change in mix. I\u2019m interested in your read on what\u2019s transpiring in pricing in the SUV market, and also whether you think perhaps some of the change in traffic trends would have reflected consumers\u2019 awareness of where you are in the SUV market. Tom Folliard : Yeah, our sales were down 2% in SUVs and medium SUVs and trucks, so 24% down to 22%. It\u2019s still a really big number for us, so I don\u2019t think traffic had anything to do with it. As you know, we try to manage our inventory based on turns and consumer demand. I don\u2019t view 2% as a very big move, and that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s still almost a fourth of all of our sales, so still a really big chunk of our sales. Matthew Fassler : To the extent that that happened during a quarter when for the market more broadly, at least on the new car side so presumably used paralleled this, SUVs gained share within the mix. Is that a function of pricing in that market at a moment when gas prices are down and there\u2019s lots of demand for that product? Tom Folliard : You know, what I\u2019ve seen in that product is prices have gone up because there\u2019s more demand, so I think the lowering of gas prices has caused some higher prices when you\u2019re looking to buy those cars at auction, but not something that caused it to move meaningfully one way or the other in terms of our sales. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Then just one quick financial question. On the warranty side, you got dinged a little bit, I guess, by warranty cancellation reversals, some accruals there that hit you. Can you quantify that for us, please? Tom Reedy : Hey Matt, it\u2019s Tom. That reserve has gotten to be a really big number over time. It\u2019s over $100 million now, and we\u2019re going to have movement in any given quarter as we learn new things about the business. So I don\u2019t think we want to get in the habit of calling out everything that is an adjustment in that line because, frankly, it\u2019s part of life going forward and we don\u2019t want to call it out as a one-timer. I can tell you, though, margin and penetration in that space are relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last year, so we\u2019re happy with how the business is going so absent the adjustment, you would have expected to see that line item increase relatively close to where unit growth was. Tom Folliard : Matt, one additional thing - if you go back a year and a half ago when we had the much bigger reserve, which we announced, called out and talked about, we also said from that point forward we would look at this in a much more granular way on a more frequent basis, so when it\u2019s a reserve the size that Tom mentioned, you could expect us to be looking at it more frequently and probably make adjustments as necessary on a quarterly basis, and unless they are material or something worthy of discussing, it will just be part of us normally running that business. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you so much. Tom Folliard : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of Keybanc. Irina Hodakovsky : Good morning, everyone. A quick question for you guys on CAF. The income growth slowed substantially sequentially, it was even down. I was wondering if there is anything to point out there, any material changes in the strategy or in terms of the end markets, anything of note? Tom Reedy : Yeah, I think from the perspective of CAF, it was a straightforward--you know, a boring quarter, which is what we like to see. That means everything is going as expected. If you remember, last quarter and, I believe, the quarter before, we had some adjustments--or not adjustments, but changes in our loss expectations which were favorable and actually boosted income growth in those quarters. This quarter, we\u2019ve seen loss experience come in as expected, right where we booked it, which is how we like to see things. So there\u2019s nothing different going on, it\u2019s just a matter of we\u2019ve seen losses come in exactly as we\u2019d been planning on. Irina Hodakovsky : Great. There was a lot of detailed discussion in terms of the used vehicles and the trends there and year-over-year comps, and all this other stuff. Can you talk on a broader level any material changes in terms of consumer demand out there? You mentioned a mix shift in SUVs. Do you see demand holding as it was before, slowing down, or anything of note? Tom Folliard : Nothing really. If you look at the first quarter and the second quarter, they are very, very similar - a little over 9% total sales growth, so that\u2019s our new stores kicking in about half of the company growth and then comps of 4.5 to 5%. So it looks very similar to the first quarter, nothing of note. Irina Hodakovsky : Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a strong beat. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks. Can you discuss the sub-prime market, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of appetite from your lenders? I saw the Tier 3 proportion was down sequentially and year-over-year. Tom Reedy : Yeah, I think the Tier 3 portion was down only very slightly year-over-year, just a couple of tenths of a point. But I think as we mentioned last quarter on the call, we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent behavior from our Tier 3 lenders, and when I say consistent behavior, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean what percentage of sales are getting done by Tier 3 because they are impacted by what is actually flowing down through the channel and that they\u2019re able to see, so if there is a change in credit mix or if our other Tier 2 lenders are becoming more aggressive, it changes the nature of what they are seeing. What we look at is their behavior on how many of the applications that they see, they approve, and if they convert, and on those bases we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent behavior. Rick Nelson : Got you, and if I could follow up with a question about [indiscernible] now over, say, the non-bank auto finance companies like CarMax. Has there been any changes that you\u2019ve implemented operationally? Tom Reedy : Sure. The larger participant ruling is out there, and frankly it was nothing of any surprise for us. There is no direct impact on our dealer operations, but as we expected all along, CarMax Auto Finance will be subject to the Bureau\u2019s supervisory authority, and what that means is we\u2019ll be interacting with them in the future, as we were pretty certain. As far as what we\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve been paying careful attention to developments in the industry as we see new announcements and new actions by them. We\u2019ve been assessing our practices as we see what we think are the expectations of the Bureau, and we\u2019ve been working hard to make sure that our compliance and program is up to snuff and will be ready for examination, if and when it comes. Rick Nelson : Okay, thanks Tom. Tom Reedy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the same store sales and the showroom traffic. I mean, obviously it sounds like the showroom traffic was pretty stagnant, or up only slightly year-over-year. Tom, what do you think is driving that? I mean, we\u2019re at a point where miles driven is increasing, gas prices are low, rates are low, employment is improving. It just seems like we\u2019re in an environment where showroom traffic for you should really be stepping up. I mean, is there something going on with the relative price of used cars versus new cars? I\u2019m just trying to understand why showroom traffic isn\u2019t up a lot. Tom Folliard : As I said earlier, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can look at on a quarter to quarter basis and get a true read. Because we have so much traffic both on our website and in our stores, if customers are not visiting as many places as they used to visit before because they\u2019re more prepared before they show up, then that could change the quality of traffic, and that\u2019s just as good as getting more traffic. So there are just so many factors that are involved in there, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one item that we could point to and say, this is why traffic was up or down in any given quarter. Again, we\u2019re trying to manage it over a much longer period of time. I don\u2019t have a great answer there. John Murphy : Yeah, it just seems like the factors should be moving for you in the right direction here. Maybe just a second question - as we look at the store openings, obviously you guys are doing a great job there. What would it take to accelerate your plan for store openings? I mean, the business is operating very well, you\u2019re executing on these store openings well. Could you ramp up the pace of openings? Tom Folliard : We clearly could from a financial standpoint. We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well, and we don\u2019t want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of the markets that we\u2019re opening and some of the stores that we\u2019re opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle - all markets which we have construction coming in the next few years, they are not just a store that opens and sells a few hundred cars a month. They also recondition in some cases 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we\u2019re starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions, and then building a giant reconditioning center in some cases attached, so really one store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. If you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we\u2019re going into some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big, complicated stores, and what we don\u2019t want to do is accelerate the growth pace and say, oh, we opened two more extra stores this year but the ones that we did open, we didn\u2019t open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution. So I don\u2019t know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive growth pace and I\u2019m really comfortable that we\u2019re growing the business effectively, and at the same time not losing track of maybe the most important thing, which is improving existing store execution. John Murphy : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Good morning, guys. It\u2019s Mike Levin on for Rod. Tom, I remember last quarter, you were a little puzzled by the down year-over-year ASPs. We kind of saw something small similar this quarter. Just wondering if you guys are getting a better handle of what might be going on, or if some of the used car supply might be starting to get better affordability for your consumers, just any kind of a beginning of a trend here. Tom Folliard : Puzzled is a good word. I think I probably was a little puzzled in the first quarter, but this quarter our ASPs are actually up sequentially, and I think ASPs should be looked at on a sequential basis more than a year-over-year basis. I think it\u2019s the more relevant data point, and I think we\u2019re up $150 from the first quarter to the second quarter. I\u2019m sure that a lot of it for us is mix related. It turned into a much bigger deal at the end of the first quarter last year when we were down by $300. I think people thought it was some type of an indicator of other things in the marketplace, and honestly we just didn\u2019t see it that way, and it hasn\u2019t borne out to be that way. So we manage the business on a per-unit basis, not on a revenue basis, so we don\u2019t really look at it that closely. But coming from the first quarter to the second quarter, we\u2019re up $150, so. Mike Levin : Got it, okay. Maybe just on CAF, it looks like the collateral spread is starting to stabilize here around 6.2%. Do you guys still feel like that might have a little room to soften from here, or with rates possibly on the rise in the near future, are you getting the ability to raise prices to end consumers at this point? Tom Reedy : I think the answer to both of those is probably a bit of a yes. You know, it\u2019s going to be a byproduct of where we--what customers are demanding, what the market is for auto loans, and what cost of financing does. We saw our costs on the last deal tick up about 20 basis points, which we see in any given period is not a big deal, but they actually were up relative to the last three deals. We are constantly testing both up and down in different pockets of the business to make sure we\u2019re optimizing what we have available for the customers, and we\u2019re going to manage the spreads at whatever the market will allow us. So hopefully--I tried to answer it, but I think the answer is both. If rates go up and we\u2019re not able to raise APRs, we\u2019d continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we\u2019ll do that; but we\u2019re absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financing perspective. Tom Folliard : I\u2019d just say if you look at this over a very long period of time, as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re one of the lenders in our store and we have to be competitive, and we also give our customers three business days to go get a better deal somewhere else and they can turn it in with no charge. Generally over time in a raising rate environment, spreads tend to compress, and in an environment where rates are going down, spreads tend to widen. Other than that, we\u2019re not in the business of trying to predict where it\u2019s going to go, but there\u2019s been a lot of talk about cost of funds increasing over time, and we\u2019ll see what happens. Tom Reedy : Yeah, and I think I said this on last quarter\u2019s call - we\u2019ve been in rate environments where benchmarks are significantly higher than they are today and lived with similar spreads to what we\u2019re doing today. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the case in the future, but as a point of reference if you want to look back at the mid-2000s, we were in a higher rate environment with pretty strong spreads of CAF. Mike Levin : Got it. Appreciate the color, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush. Seth Basham : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is just a follow-up on CAF. Obviously the penetration improved a little bit year-over-year, about 200 basis points. Would you say that you guys were a little bit more aggressive in terms to get that type of penetration, or is there anything else you could point to there? Tom Reedy : I think there\u2019s a couple things going on from that perspective. Part of it is what\u2019s coming in the door. Credit quality in the door was up a couple points year-over-year, so that naturally would lend towards CAF getting more of the volume. Also, we have been a bit more aggressive in our testing, and we probably did take a little volume from Tier 2. You can see that in the other financing margin line where even given the fact that Tier 3 was down a little bit, that we had a slight increase in fees paid to other financial parties, and that\u2019s because Tier 2 was down a little bit as well. Seth Basham : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then secondly, in terms of inventory availability, Tom, you spoke to the huge competitive advantage you guys have there, but it seems like nowadays almost every other used car in a given market is online and customers are willing to travel a bit further to buy those cars. Does that sort of change the competitive dynamics in your view, or not? Tom Folliard : It depends on who the competitor is that they then go and buy the car from. I mean, we\u2019ve been consistently the retailer that offers a no-haggle price, easy access to financing with no negotiation, a cash offer on every car, a 30-day warranty, a five-day money back guarantee, three days to go get a better loan somewhere else. We stand behind the product that we sell. We have a seamless process. Our sales consultants are not paid a commission based on which car you buy or how much profit we make, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the fact that the car is available. I think it still goes back to the process that the customer has to go through and whether or not they are comfortable doing that, and I think that\u2019s something that we continue to have a very large competitive advantage on.  So the market is extremely fragmented and the fact that all of those cars are online doesn\u2019t change the fact that when the customer goes and actually goes through the process, they still have to go through a process in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Seth Basham : Got it, so increased price transparency isn\u2019t really a big issue for you guys because of the offer that you had all around, not just price? Tom Folliard : Well, increased price transparency is price transparency on the price of the car only, which is almost always negotiable, and then the price of the trade, which is always negotiable, and then the price of the financing, which is ridiculously negotiable, and then the price of all the add-on products like extended service plan or accessories, which are also negotiable. So when you look at it from top to bottom and the fact that we are straightforward and transparent on all of the pieces of the transaction, I think we have a significant competitive advantage and it shows up in our volumes. Seth Basham : Got it. Thanks and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, guys. Just one question on CAF. Your weighted contract rate was up a little bit year-over-year but down sequentially. Are there any seasonal factors involved, or was it more the customer mix? How should we look at that? Tom Reedy : Yeah, Q4 and Q1 are typically lower credit mixes, so you might see a little bit it skews down our Bs and Cs then, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything to read into it. There\u2019s nothing from a behavioral perspective that we did differently. Bill Armstrong : Okay, so you would just kind of consider it within the norm? Tom Reedy : I\u2019d say what\u2019s coming through the door is probably driving that. Bill Armstrong : Yeah, got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen, in order to ask a question, please press star and the number one. Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. Going back to the NFL endorsement deals, should we think of this more as a very large scale trial, or should we expect more deals like this going forward because, as you noted, you are a bigger company? Tom Folliard : You know, like any other advertising program that we have tried or run in the past, we\u2019ll evaluate it based on its performance and determine if it should be a bigger piece of what we do going forward. We\u2019ve been a sponsor of the Los Angeles Clippers for almost 10 years now, so this isn\u2019t our first sports sponsorship, it\u2019s just our first NFL sponsorship. David Whiston : Okay. You mentioned at the beginning of the call, about 65% of your business is coming from something other than a laptop or desktop. Is there anything that a smartphone or tablet user cannot do today that someone on a laptop or desktop can do? Tom Folliard : That was 65% of our web hits, not 65% of our business. So it\u2019s 65% of the total hits coming to our website are coming from a tablet or on a--you know, we have a different site for each, so there\u2019s a mobile site you go through on the mobile device and then there\u2019s an app, and the app has somewhat limited capability, but all the things that we think are most important - the ability to search for a car, the ability to look at 40 high definition pictures, the ability to zoom in on each of them, the ability to find a store and contact a sales consultant. We are continuing to work on adding additional capabilities, but clearly there are more capabilities on a desktop just because there\u2019s more room and there is more access for the customer to do more things online. But we are continuing to work on our app and continuing to give the customer more capabilities based on their demands. David Whiston : Okay. Can you transfer on an app? Tom Folliard : Can you transfer on an app? You cannot transfer on the app right now. You can\u2019t go in and enter your credit card information and transfer a car, no. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hey guys, good morning. I wanted to ask on the retail gross profit per unit, which was quite consistent there, a lot of the public competitors on the dealer side have been seeing mid-single digit declines, and you guys have been really persistent. So can you just discuss some of the levers you might have, and how should we think about that going forward? Tom Folliard : You know, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with managing our margins over a pretty long period of time now. I can\u2019t comment on the way others manage their business, but we\u2019re pretty confident in our ability to manage margin through all kinds of different environments. Even going back to the recession, we were able to manage margin pretty effectively and inventory turns during that time, which is the most significant single piece of volatility that we\u2019ve seen in our time running the business. So we feel pretty confident in our ability to be pretty consistent with our margins. Michael Montani : Thanks. Just one other issue was on the buyback potential. From a debt to cap standpoint, I think that you all have said that there is opportunity there to perhaps be a little bit more aggressive, so maybe for Tom Reedy, if you could just go through how you\u2019re thinking about that, and then also what are the metrics you would use to evaluate if you want to get more aggressive with the buyback. Tom Reedy : Yeah, we\u2019ve tried to be pretty consistent in our approach, and the fundamental to it was that we obviously are continuing having a priority of returning capital to shareholders as it\u2019s appropriate, and we also believe that we could use a little additional leverage in our capital structure. We\u2019ve talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We\u2019ve made some progress - we\u2019ve bought back about 1.8 billion since the start of the program, or about 15% of the shares that were outstanding as of October of 2012, but we still think there\u2019s--as you\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019ve made a little bit of progress on the cash balance this past quarter, it\u2019s gone down about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we were considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today, so I think we\u2019d expect to continue on with the program as is. As far as how aggressive we get, we set up the program with bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation, allow us to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop, and vice versa if price and valuation are up. We review that on an ongoing basis and will adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, the stock price was down, we were a bit up on our volume; last quarter, it was the opposite, so you can see we do take a bit of a view on how much volume to buy at given prices, but remember, it\u2019s going to be a programmatic approach over time. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and the number one. Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of Keybanc. Irina, your line is open. Irina Hodakovsky : Sorry about that - I was on mute. I have one follow-up question on the recall question that was asked earlier. Auto Nation made a move to ground all vehicles under recall. There was a recent attempt to implement a law similar to that - it didn\u2019t work right now, and in near term nobody expects that, but longer term it could become an issue if the industry moves in that direction. Was just wondering if you had discussed that internally, if this is a concern, how material--is it just a higher cost issue, maybe higher inventory cost? And if it\u2019s not a concern, then why not? Tom Folliard : Well, it is a concern. We\u2019ve talked about it at length. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re always trying to do what\u2019s the most transparent thing that we can do for our customers. Something to remember is we\u2019re in a different--we are almost exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises, and actually two less as of this quarter. We\u2019re down to just two Toyota stores, one in Baltimore, one in Kenosha, and any repairs that are under warranty, which include recalls for us, have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws passed, we have always complied with all the laws. If there was a law passed that required us to fix recalls, we would absolutely do that; but then, everybody would be in the exact same boat and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturers\u2019 locations. We think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there\u2019s an open recall on the car and also how important it is to register on a manufacturer\u2019s website. We may sell them a car and a week later a recall may come out, and if they haven\u2019t registered with the manufacturer, then they won\u2019t ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the NHTSA database. It automatically populates the VIN for the customer so they can see exactly what\u2019s going on with that individual car, and then at the point of sale our sales consultants are walking through with the customer exactly what I just said - whether or not the call has a open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturer on their website so they can be notified of recalls going forward. So we\u2019re absolutely committed to transparency, and if there\u2019s any changes in the law, obviously we\u2019ll comply with all those laws. Irina Hodakovsky : Thank you. Tom Folliard : All right, thanks very much for your interest in CarMax, and thanks to all of our associates for all they do every day. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you saw, we had a challenging third quarter due primarily to slightly negative used unit comps. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. Used unit comps decreased by 0.8%, while total used units grew by 3.2%. Gross profit per unit of $2,160 was in line with gross profit per unit of $2,172 in the third quarter of last year. And total wholesale units grew 3.4%, about the same rate as total retail units. Gross profit per wholesale unit grew by $22 to $949 per car sold. CAF income also grew 3% to approximately $92 million. I will turn it over to Tom Reedy to talk about finance. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter fiscal \u201815 and average managed receivables grew by 15% to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year\u2019s third quarter of 7.0%. Our total interest margin declined to 6.0% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter. We saw some tick up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in the loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables consistent with last year\u2019s third quarter at 0.98%. CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in stores. The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our sub-prime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion due to combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration. As you saw in the press release, Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales is 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit, but moderate growth at the higher end. During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million. We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is booked debt to capital after backing out the notes in receivables associated with non-recourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and returning value to shareholders. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were 23% down from 25% in last year\u2019s third quarter, but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter. Our lower used unit comps were primarily a result of modestly lower traffic in our stores partially offset by better conversion. Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our cost may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we have seen a decrease in the supply of 5-year-old to 10-year-old cars as you would expect. Second, we have seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings from new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of 0 and 1-year-old cars. Wholesale prices of SUVs and trucks have increased. So, some don\u2019t represent a good value for our customers. And as Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Now despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in the third quarter for the company and our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars. SG&A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign. During the third quarter, we opened 2 stores in existing markets, our sixth store in Houston and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. And after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of 2 stores in Danvers and Norwood. And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to SUVs, I know you guys were down about 200 basis points year-on-year. Do you have a sense for what the used market is doing for SUV mix, in general? In other words, do you think used market sales of \u2013 do you think the mix of SUVs to the market is down, is it flat, is it up or are you differing in the way you are indexing in SUVs versus your broader competition? Tom Folliard : I am not sure which is the broader competition, Matt, but we were up a point compared to the second quarter and we still sold a lot of trucks and SUVs in the quarter, 23% of our total sales. But as I mentioned, our prices were pretty high during the quarter. And as you know, we buy a lot of cars at the auction and our buyers are trying to make sure we always deliver a great value to our customers. So, there are times during the quarter and we just didn\u2019t think it was worth overpaying at the expense of giving a great value to the consumer. I think this is probably short-lived. Obviously, it\u2019s been driven by low gas prices. We have seen bigger increases in new car sales as it relates to SUVs and trucks compared to the used car market increases. But ultimately, these cars will all come back into the market at some point. Matthew Fassler : And then my follow-up for you briefly, the advertising dollar shift into Q3, was that out of Q2 or out of Q4? Tom Folliard : Really, we just wanted to point out that we launched a new campaign during the quarter and that this just \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be a typical increase for us in terms of our quarter-over-quarter expense given that the sales level that we had. So, we weren\u2019t really trying to say came from one place to the other just this is not what you would expect typically from us on a year-over-year basis. We did create and launch a new campaign during the quarter that started in September. Matthew Fassler : And how do you guys feel that campaign wise as you measure, I know given where the sales force you measure the return on that ad campaign, I know it\u2019s been early to judge, but your own evaluation? Tom Folliard : Yes, it\u2019s very early to judge. Particularly when you have a new broadcast campaign, it\u2019s mostly around brand building and not necessarily for short-term sales gain. You guys know we are not promotional. We don\u2019t have sales. So, most of our campaigns are long-term brand building. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning and Thanks for taking my question. So first I think my first question is just basically follow-up to what Matt asked, but Tom thanks for laying out some of the extra color there with regard to sales in the quarter, but how do we think about if you take those individually, how do we think about the I guess the trajectory from here, I mean it seems the comments you made some of those factors will begin to abate here, but maybe a little more color on that as to how we should think about these factors going into the balance of this fiscal year and into 2016? Tom Folliard : One, it\u2019s very difficult to attribute a number of points to each of the factors. They are just all things that we noted during the quarter. We also had our toughest comparison of the year, which I didn\u2019t mention. And our 2-year stack comp in the third quarter was actually higher than it was in the second quarter. But I think each of these things had a little bit of an impact on our ability to deliver during the quarter. Most of them I think are short-lived, it\u2019s very difficult to predict trends and when things are going to change and supply, but I think we have done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to adjust and adapt to changing trends in the used car marketplace. I think we will do the same here. I just thought those were things we should have pointed out during the quarter. A lot of the supply stuff is going to take care of itself over time and we are going to take advantage of the things that present themselves to us. Brian Nagel : Got it. And then so maybe a follow-up to that, I think there is a lot of comments or commentary out there about new competitive \u2013 new competitors coming into your marketplace, have you seen anything new with respect to this, your stores that may compete more directly with some of this new competition? Tom Folliard : I mean, we \u2013 it\u2019s an ever-changing marketplace. A lot of the stuff we have seen is around additional capabilities, which we are working really hard to continue to increase for our customers. And as I mentioned remember, our average store sold 340 cars a month during the quarter. If you look at industry data, the average new car dealer sells about 50 cars a month. So it\u2019s really hard to say that we are losing ground and a lot of that stuff that you read about for \u2013 from new competition are very small players in very limited markets. So it\u2019s not likely that we are seeing an impact across the nation for our 153 stores when a lot of the press you see is around very small players in limited markets. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thanks and best of luck with balance of the year. Tom Folliard : Thanks Brian Nagel. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi good morning. My first question I think is pretty easy. I did not see any kind of quantification of the ad spend kind of the launch and how much of that might have been incremental, Tom do you have any color you can provide on that? Tom Folliard : We did not quantify it, but of the $9 million difference year-over-year, the majority of it was around the new launch. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. And then obviously you have seen the cycles in terms of kind of how the wholesale market adjust to maybe supply/demand anomalies, so on this whole kind of conversation around SUVs, could you kind of provide some historical perspective perhaps about anomalies you might have seen in the past and kind of how long a correction might take in the pricing in the wholesale market? Tom Folliard : I mean, I can probably comment on some anomalies in the past, but in terms of how long a correction takes, I think there is too many macro factors involved. But we are seeing, as you know highest SAAR we have ever seen and the bigger of the increase in the SAAR is related to trucks and SUVs. If I was thinking about that over a long period of time, that means a couple of years from now we will see lot of trucks and SUVs out in the wholesale market, which if there is demand, then we will be able to take advantage of that and buy and sell them. I think the other big variable that\u2019s impossible to predict is first, gas prices and then second, the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of \u201808 when gas hit $4 nobody would buy an SUV of any kind. But in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things kind of went back to where they were. Since then when we have seen gas prices increase we haven\u2019t seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while and I think it\u2019s provided a boost for trucks and SUVs. But it\u2019s really hard to say what will happen going forward. I just think our model is best equipped to take advantage of whatever the market brings. We are not holding to any manufacturer or any type of product and we want to sell whatever the customer wants to buy. Sharon Zackfia : I want to violate Katharine\u2019s two question rule. Just one last follow-up I guess, what you are seeing right now, will you characterize as kind of normal ebbs and flows that you have seen in the market over time or is there anything that gives you longer-term more fundamental concerns? Tom Folliard : Yes. We don\u2019t see anything that causes us long-term concerns. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I know it\u2019s early, but you did just enter the Boston market and I am curious if you have seen any or had any surprises as you enter that market? Tom Folliard : We have been open for less than a week. So I really couldn\u2019t \u2013 I am not going to comment. Craig Kennison : Even from a staffing standpoint, you are able to staff the different types of positions you need? Tom Folliard : We were able to staff. I will say Boston was a bit challenging with staffing, but our teams did a great job of finding a bunch of really great people and we are very excited about our go forward there. Craig Kennison : And then in terms of technology, could you cover Tom, your priorities for the next 12 months in terms of digital and technology initiatives? Tom Folliard : Well, our priorities are somewhat unchanged. We want to keep making sure that our customers have a great experience regardless of how they interact with CarMax, it could be from a desktop, it could be from a mobile device, a tablet or in the store and we are very focused on making the transition from their digital experience to the store simple and seamless so that the experience they have online matches up with the experience that they have in the store. And we are also pushing real hard over the next 12 months or so to make sure that our store teams are equipped with information that\u2019s available regarding the individual customers to try to make their experience more personalized. We have a very big database of customers and we are going to make sure that we can access that information and that our associates in the store can access the information when the customers arrive. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Tom Folliard : And also we just want to keep increasing capabilities of customers if they want to do more and more of the transaction online. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. Just a first question, Tom as we think about sort of these tougher comps, I mean basically we are looking at multi-decade lows in the zero to 5-year-old portion of the fleet in absolute terms. And certainly, 30-plus year lows as far as the percentage of the total population of cars outstanding. So I mean as we see that zero to 5-year-old bucket grow in the next 1 year, 2 years or 3 years, don\u2019t you just sort of naturally \u2013 would you just naturally expect your same-store sales to recover as that addressable market recovers and sort of the pressure we are seeing here is just a function of the supply? Tom Folliard : Well, I expect us to be able to comp our stores over a long period of time and I think there is lots of external factors that either help or hurt. I have always felt like the supply of zero to 5-year-old cars increasing is good for us. It\u2019s an area where on a market share basis, if you look at an individual year-to-year basis, we have \u2013 it\u2019s been kind of our sweet spot. So I mean I agree as the supply increases there, I think we will do better in those segments. What I feel even \u2013 what I also feel good about is coming out of the recession, we did a really good job of figuring out how to sell older cars as well. And I feel like we can do both. So you look at the CarMax consumer offering at zero to 10-year-old cars and I think we are pretty good across the spectrum at near new cars and then older cars with higher miles. I don\u2019t think anybody does good a job reconditioning as we do. I don\u2019t think anybody in a better position to take advantage of those sales as we are. John Murphy : Okay. And then just sort of a follow-up and the second question, I mean when you look at the gap of new versus used pricing and then you look at the financing offerings that are at \u2013 in the new vehicle dealers for new vehicles. It just seems like it\u2019s very compelling for a zero to 5-year-old or even zero to 10-year-old consumer to trip into buying a new vehicle, I mean if you look at zero to 5-year-old car, basically the gap on a monthly payment basis $100 are actually potentially significant and less depending on what kind of financing they get at their new vehicle dealership. I mean how do you kind of fight that tide, I mean and do you think you just need that supply plus pricing to come down to create a wider gap to drive those consumers back and to use vehicles, because it\u2019s incredibly tight right now, I am just trying to understand how that dynamic might change and if there is anything you can do to help change it? Tom Folliard : Well, it\u2019s not like this doesn\u2019t happen, it hasn\u2019t happened before. There are always pockets or segments of near new cars that given incentive environment whether it\u2019s through cash back or leasing, oftentimes consumers will make that decision. It doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t come back to us 3 years or 4 years or 5 years later when they are buying something different. And I do want to point out our average car is around $20,000 and the average new car is around $33,000. So the difference on average has not come down at all, in fact it\u2019s widened. But it\u2019s always true that at any given point in time, given \u2013 depending on the incentive environment that there are some closed calls there and I think it was especially true this quarter and that\u2019s why I pointed it out. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel. James Albertine : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just another follow-up on the trends you are seeing in the new cycle. And quite frankly, you have lived through a lot of obstacles and a lot of other headwinds over the last 20 years. It doesn\u2019t seem like there is anything you can\u2019t weather, but it seems like this time might be a little different, particularly among the domestic manufacturers given the propensity to lease. Is there a higher likelihood that some of these new vehicles that are selling on the SUV and truck side go back to dealers rather than hitting the auction market and that \u2013 could that limit your availability of supply in the coming years or is that something that you considered and aren\u2019t really worried about? Tom Folliard : Well, it\u2019s something we have lived through before in terms of percent of new car sales that are leased. I think the number now is around 30%. It\u2019s been this high at times before. Generally, what that means is 2, 3 years down the road those cars will come back to the market in a kind of a more organized way. And dealers won\u2019t be able to absorb the volume that comes back and a lot of those cars end up at auction and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened historically. And we have been able to take advantage of that in the past. I never look at a high lease environment as a negative for us when you think about supply 2 or 3 years later. If you think about this cycle of people getting out of a new car, if it remains that people get out of their car every 3 to 5 years, it really doesn\u2019t make any difference whether it comes back through a lease channel or it comes back as an individual car, eventually they end up in the open marketplace and we have an opportunity to buy them. James Albertine : Got it. And that ties I think with your 340 cars per month comment versus 50 per month average that you made earlier. There is not a capacity for the dealers to handle the off lease. So, I appreciate that color. And then a quick follow-up on the credit market now that we have finally seen a rate increase and if you look over the last few CAF securitizations, it appears as though the spread might be stabilizing, but really wanted to get kind of an update there as to what you think if we are near that stabilization point or even now that rates are up sort of optically consumers are now expecting higher rates, does that allow you now to sort of increase the APR and maybe even see that spread expand in the near term? Thanks. Tom Reedy : Yes, this is Tom. As far as the spread to the customer go, that\u2019s going to be really market-dependent as we have said in the past. Our first goal of CarMax auto finance is to provide a competitive offer to the customer and we will go where the market dictates we go. That said, we are constantly testing both up and down to make sure we are optimizing CarMax sales and CAF income at the same time. We have seen a little bit of cost of funds increase this year. We have been testing rates upward a little bit. But I really can\u2019t give you any kind of forward-looking theory on where that spread will go, because it\u2019s going to be market rate based. Historically, as rates have come up, we have been a little bit as the market has slower to adjust upward, because that rates can be sticky and conversely when rates have been coming down, you are usually a little slow to adjust downward because the market is going to drive that as well and you see a little bit of a benefit. But as far as going forward, yes, the market will tell. I think now that the Fed has given some guidance, I think about where they are going with interest rates that stabilize things from the perspective of spreads in the asset-backed market. We saw our spreads gap up in the last year versus prior deals even though we are in a lower interest rate environment, but I think some of that was uncertainty around what Fed was going to do. James Albertine : Got it. Well, thank you again and best of luck in the remaining quarter. Tom Reedy : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lynn Walter of Wells Fargo. Lynn Walter : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just regarding traffic, can you talk about, was that consistent throughout the quarter, any regions that you saw more impact than others? Tom Folliard : Yes, we don\u2019t give regional or quarterly differences. I said what it was for the quarter and that\u2019s all the information we give. Lynn Walter : Okay. Let me just ask one other one then if that\u2019s okay. Just following up on your digital capabilities that you are talking about adding how should we think about the kind of investments required to bring those up to what you are talking about? Tom Folliard : Well, a lot of the investment can be done within our normal spend over the course of the year. We have a pretty significant spend in both IT and marketing and a lot of the investments that we will be making can go over that normal course, but we are looking forward at what types of bigger investments might we need to make. And when we have something to talk about there, we will let everyone know. Lynn Walter : Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of KeyBanc. Irina Hodakovsky : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for you. The lower floor traffic that you called out in your release, what do you think are the drivers, is it the lack of the SUVs and trucks you pointed out as a difficult supply right now or is it perhaps competition and new entrants into the market who are competing in the standalone used vehicle stores? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s really hard to say, but I do want to point out, we did get enough traffic to sell 340 cars a month per store. And it was only slightly down. And then conversion was slightly up. And we ended up where we ended up. But in terms of traffic through the door, I think there is a chance that customers are being more prepared and are more likely to buy when they show up. And for us if we could get traffic that\u2019s more prepared and more likely to buy, that\u2019s just as good for us as it is if we just got plain old extra traffic. So, it\u2019s not as easy an answer as you might think, but we had a lot of traffic in our stores during the quarter. It\u2019s slightly down compared to last year. Irina Hodakovsky : Okay, thank you. And the second question for you. You mentioned in your opening remarks one of the headwinds impact in the comps was the lower supply of 0 to 5-year-old cars, is that as in general to what we have been hearing or are you seeing an actual sequential pullback in this supply from, let\u2019s say, in the second or the first quarter? Tom Folliard : Actually, while I mentioned supply, I said the supply was down in 5 to 10-year-old cars, not 0 to 5. And in 5 to 10-year-old cars, it just makes sense since the SAAR that you are building off of in years, I don\u2019t know 6, 7 or 8 was dramatically lower than what the SAAR is today. Remember, we had a SAAR as low as 10 in September of \u201808. So, I was referencing the supply of older cars. Irina Hodakovsky : Thank you for that clarification. Thank you, guys. Tom Folliard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore. Michael Montani : Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about if you could just talk us through how you think about managing the business in terms of balancing inventory turns with gross profit dollars per unit. Generally speaking, some of the publicly traded dealer peers have shown a little bit higher used unit comps, but then they have also shown greater erosion in terms of GPUs. So, just trying to think through how you would run the business and any tests you may have had tweaking either of those two elements? Tom Folliard : Yes. We have talked about this in the past. We run pricing test on a pretty regular basis. You can also see we have been very consistent with the margins that we have been able to achieve. So look, there is no way to go back and say, look what if we had lower prices, how many more cars would we have sold? My guess is we probably gave up a little bit of share by maintaining our prices during the quarter, but it\u2019s impossible to quantify. I don\u2019t think however that we gave up gross margin dollars and I don\u2019t think that we \u2013 I think we try to make the decision that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders each and every quarter. So, we did see the decline in margins that some of the other publicly traded auto retailers reported ending September. And it maybe helped their comps a little bit, but as far as we are concerned, we can only make the best decision we can with the information that we have and that\u2019s what we did during the quarter. And we are okay with the results. Michael Montani : Okay. And then if I could just follow-up on one which is the leverage point. I believe in the past, you have said 4% to 5% being the comp that you would need to show leverage. And obviously, the commentary today is that there is no change to the outlook for future year store growth. So, should we assume that\u2019s the same, because I know there is a lot of initiatives that you guys are working on in terms of cost to try and prove that as well? Tom Folliard : Yes, we think \u2013 we have always said kind of mid single-digits. We have never really put an exact number on it. It\u2019s also dependent on the rate of growth during any given quarter. It\u2019s also dependent on the type of growth during the quarter, opening up the big metro markets, more expensive than opening up smaller stores. And as you saw during this quarter, there is occasionally some timing of expenses that\u2019s going to impact it, but I think if you think about it over a long period of time with the growth plan that we have publicly announced mid single-digits or so, I think we can leverage our SG&A dollars. Michael Montani : Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, Tom. Just getting back to the SUV light truck mix, yes, I mean, so if we look at total industry sales 2012 through \u201814, about 50% of total sales were light trucks, so call it SUVs and pickups. Your sales and inventory mix clearly is much less. So, are you seeing \u2013 are you not seeing that many of those vehicles available for sale or is it they are maybe not in the condition that you want to re-retail, like what \u2013 there seems to be a disconnect there? Tom Folliard : Did you say it \u2013 just I didn\u2019t hear what you said about the mix, did you say 50%? Bill Armstrong : 50% of all car \u2013 vehicles sold from 2012 to 2014 were light classified as light trucks, so SUVs and pickups basically? Tom Folliard : Yes. I haven\u2019t heard that number before, but I believe you, but that\u2019s never been the case for us. I mean, we had always been in the mid-20s. So this isn\u2019t... Katharine Kenny : Not the same metric. Tom Folliard : Hold on a second. Our 23% is medium and large SUVs and pickup trucks. I think the 50% includes crossovers and smaller SUVs. So that\u2019s not in our number. And I don\u2019t have that number handy to tell you what the mix was. I think in general over time, we are going to look a lot like the industry looks. Our sample is very large. We are very widespread across the country. And in general, we are going to look like the industry looks over time. I mean that\u2019s where our supply comes from and we are going to match up consumer demand. It\u2019s never going to be exact particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but if you look at what we have historically reported in trucks and SUVs, it\u2019s generally been in the mid-20s, sometimes in the high 20s. This quarter was 23%. It was up a point from the time before, remembering that we are talking about two different measures. Bill Armstrong : Okay, got it. Do you feel like maybe you are missing some opportunity then with the SUVs or not necessarily? Tom Folliard : Well, as I have said I think during the quarter, there was a chance that we could have paid more. It\u2019s not like the cars weren\u2019t out there, but we are always trying to deliver a great value to the consumer as well. So there are always times when certain things at the auction, we just think they are too expensive and we don\u2019t want to buy them and then turn around and resell them, so we wait. And I think the same thing is true here. We have been around a long time. We have seen cycles go up and cycles go down. And as I mentioned earlier, who knows what happens with gas prices. You see a big spike in gas prices and there is a good chance our SUV mix would go up during that time because those cars will be cheaper and be a better value to our customers. But I did mention it during the quarter we saw that there was a lot of pressure on SUV pricing. Bill Armstrong : Got it. Okay, that makes sense. If I can just sneak one in, extended protection plan revenue lagged vehicle sales a little bit anything to call out there? Tom Reedy : Nothing in particular, in general we would expect that business to grow with unit sales. This quarter, we had some adjustments in the return reserve. Remember that\u2019s like $100 million reserve, kind of plus $1 million reserve and we are going to see small movements in that based on experience as we see it, as we go forward, so nothing really exciting to report, it\u2019s just an adjustment. Bill Armstrong : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens. Nick Zangler : This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. I was just wondering \u2013 are you guys considering any changes in the policy of selling recalled vehicles, obviously one of the larger dealer group sees those sales, I think to enhance their brand name and obviously you guys have a very strong brand name, but any thoughts there and in general how do you recall cars in that view operationally? Tom Folliard : We talked about this on the last call. Remember we don\u2019t have \u2013 we are not authorized to repair recalls at our stores. And obviously, the recall environment has changed over the last several years. We think the most important thing is being completely transparent with our customers and making sure that they are fully informed. And also that they register on the manufacturers website because I mean we can sell them a car today and a recall could come next week and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered whether or not we did anything to the car. And we think it\u2019s very important that they are notified. We are the only retailer that \u2013 we are the only car retailer that has a direct link to the NHTSA website. And it\u2019s VIN-specific and we pre-populate the VIN so any customer that\u2019s on the CarMax website can look up any \u2013 all recall information on each and every individual car. And then, during the sales process, we make sure that we point out to every customer the recall status. We help them register with the manufacturer and historically the relationship as it relates to recalls between the manufacturer the customer who owns the car and we want to make sure that customers are fully informed and get that information going forward. So our policy is 100% transparency as it relates to recalls. Nick Zangler : Great, understand. And then just in general, where do you guys stand with third party lead generators what was the proportion of sales through those sites in the quarter? Tom Folliard : We never talk about proportion of sales, but we have been asked about Cars.com and AutoTrader.com and we have not used those sites for a long time. Nick Zangler : Great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Healy of Northcoast Research. Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the distinction between SUVs and crossovers, on the crossover side for vehicles like RAV4, CR-V, Chevy Equinox, can you talk a bit about what kind of pricing you are seeing in auction for those vehicles? Tom Folliard : I don\u2019t have that information handy, but those are good sellers for us. But I don\u2019t have the mix in front of me. I am sorry. David Whiston : What I am basically asking, are you having inventory issues there, it sounds like similar to what you are talking about the SUVs is that an issue at all? Tom Folliard : Yes. I don\u2019t think so. David Whiston : Okay. And Tom Reedy, you mentioned before Q&A that you are on the low end of your leverage, so can we infer that you are not going to pay back the incremental revolver borrowing anytime soon? Tom Reedy : I think that\u2019s fair. I mean, the revolver balance is going to be something that\u2019s quite seasonal. As you know we buy up inventory pretty significantly in the fall and we sell through it in the winter and into the spring. So it\u2019s there to manage liquidity. But as I mentioned, I think we have kind of got a target range of leverage we would like to manage to. I would expect to keep adding debt as we go forward and buying back stock to manage to that level. And it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question for us to do something. Think about the revolvers kind of like if you look at our conduit facilities on the asset back side. It\u2019s something that we can use to manage liquidity, but then when you get critical mass, it would take it out of a longer term instrument. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain of Morgan Stanley. Paresh Jain : Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier, so if I am hearing you right, stable GPU seems to be the more important metric here for CarMax, am I thinking about it right or how would you characterize your most important metric, is this comp or is it GPU? Tom Folliard : Our most important metric is sales. And then we have just been able to manage gross profit per unit very consistently over time. We want to make sure that we have given our consumers a great value. One of the things that we are very focused on is continuing to aggressively manage our costs because the price of the consumer is not just the margin but also the cost that we put into a car during the reconditioning process and we continue to put enormous efforts around the engineering that we \u2013 we have turned our reconditioning process into an engineer process and we want to continue to try to figure out how to lower our costs, so we can still deliver great price to the consumer and maintain our margin so that we are delivering a good return for our shareholders. Paresh Jain : Understood. And then on a most strategic front, I wanted to talk about dealer partnerships with ride and car sharing businesses, we see some of these businesses big and small, looking to partner with dealers on two fronts, either to buy or sell a car or in some cases, just utilize of used car sitting on dealer lots and pay dealers a fee. How do you feel about these partnerships between ride sharing firms and dealer businesses, are there potential hurdles in this type of arrangement or maybe there are no issues and it make sense to make some money on used cars while sitting on the lot? Tom Folliard : We haven\u2019t really explored those avenues for us. The one thing I would say is it is an incredibly fragmented business and a huge marketplace. There are over 40 million cars \u2013used cars sold annually in the U.S. We are very small fraction of that. So as I said, we haven\u2019t looked at those things in particular, but we try to pay attention to all of things that are available in the marketplace and see if we think there is an opportunity for us. But right now, our biggest opportunity is to continue to grow the business in markets that we are not in, continue to add stores back into places where we already have a presence. We are only reaching about 60% of the U.S. population. I think we have incredible growth in front of us. And right now, those are the kinds of things that we are focused on. Paresh Jain : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Iannarone of RBC Markets. Robert Iannarone : Hey, guys. Robert Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just a couple of quick questions for you, some of the credit data that we have tracked has indicated outsized growth in 72-month plus financing arm, I was just wondering if you could give us any commentary on what you are seeing in customer behavior and their desire for longer term loans for their vehicles? Tom Folliard : Yes, I think the way I can respond to that is that like I said we are going to be a market-driven lender at CAF and we are going to make sure we are doing the best thing for our customers. And it\u2019s always a balancing act. So, we are going to be continually testing and assume it makes sense. I think recent \u2013 the data you might be pointing to recent Experian [ph] data shows about 15% of used volumes getting done at terms longer than 72. We are not sure how much of that is actually pushing out more than a couple of months. But as I said, we will stay competitive. If we see the need to move, we will, but at this point, we don\u2019t feel comfortable to rush into any longer term financing. Robert Iannarone : Great. Thanks. And just one more on advertising so second quarter in the row now we have seen the advertising expense tick up. You have certainly commented on this in the last couple of calls for us. Just wondering if we should expect that to normalize going forward that you are in the Boston market and you have launched this new campaign? Tom Folliard : Yes, we are going to make decisions throughout the quarter as well. But as I said, this increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis would not be typical for us. Robert Iannarone : Okay, thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. I got back in line and I guess there was room. I have two follow-ups for you. The first relates to write-downs. What can you talk about in terms of the drivers of the tick up in write-downs? How would you relate it to underwriting standards? You talked about seeing higher quality credit applications etcetera. Just give us a sense if you could about how to think about those write-downs and how we might model of them out from here? Tom Folliard : Are you talking about CAF losses? Matthew Fassler : Correct. Tom Folliard : I am sorry, Matt. Yes, I think what I mentioned about the close in the quarter was that it was a quarterly \u2013 this quarter phenomenon for the last several, several, several quarters, in fact, most of them, we have seen growth in kind of all areas in the credit spectrum this quarter. We saw decline in application volume and lower FICO stuff and a continued growth in the higher end stuff, the 650 plus. That\u2019s what I meant by the traffic. That\u2019s unrelated to what\u2019s going on with charge-offs. Charge-offs has to do with what\u2019s in the portfolio and it\u2019s been put in there over the last several years. And the way I characterize it is we have had a long stream of favorable experience and at some point, it was \u2013 the tide was going to turn in. Things were probably going to normalize. I would probably characterize it as giving back some of the favorable experience we have had over the last several quarters. It\u2019s too early to tell what that means from a go-forward perspective. But as I mentioned, the reserve balance today is at the same level as a percent of receivables that was last year. Matthew Fassler : And is there anything that you saw in recent delinquency data that would lead you to be incrementally concerned or do you feel like the book is still in very good shape? Tom Folliard : Now, as I said, we have got a quarter\u2019s worth of data and we will take it as it comes. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then my next question just you bought back an awful lot of stock during what was obviously a tough quarter, what would you need to see? What would it take in terms of fundamentals of the business to lead you to slow that buyback down? Tom Folliard : Well, Matt, as I said I think we have kind of got into the lower end of the leverage range that we have been targeting. And on a go-forward basis, we will continue to do it, to manage the capital structure going forward. I can\u2019t comment on what would it compels do anything, because market conditions could be \u2013 in the future could be all over the board. I just think you should take away that we are going to continue using it. We are going to continue using a programmatic approach. You saw during the quarter that we stepped up volumes based on what the stock price did. But on a go-forward basis, it\u2019s probably more of managing the structure perspective rather than moving to a new capital structure. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Tom Folliard : Alright. There are no more calls. I want to thank everybody for your interest in CarMax. And of course, I want to thank all of our more than 22,000 CarMax associates for all they do everyday to make CarMax a success and a great place to work and happy holidays to everyone. Thanks for joining us. Bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Katharine Kenny : Hi, thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nash, our President; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015 with the SEC and we will be filing our most recent 10-K shortly. As always, I hope you will all remember to ask only one question and a follow-up before getting back in the queue to give everyone a chance to ask a question. Thank you. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion and we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever, about 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still \u2013 while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year. Some key drivers for the year. Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income, up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal \u201816 up 4.4% to $623 million and EPS up 11% to $3.03. Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of the 0 to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million. For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion and total used units grew by 4%. Our total web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share. While in the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalize interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share. I will now turn it over to Tom Reedy to give you some details around CAF. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter. For the quarter charge-offs and loss provision were in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores, where we continue to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, that\u2019s due to combination of growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our sub-prime test was similar to last year 0.7% versus 0.6% of the sales in the prior year. As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5%, as CarMax\u2019s overall Tier 3 sales. Tier 3 financing, as a percent of sales, was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 largely due to the reduced volume of lower credit applications I mentioned earlier. In Q4, we continue to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares. And since inception of the program, we repurchased 46.4 million shares. At the end of FY \u201816, we had 1.4 billion remaining under the current authorization. Now, I will turn the call over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Midsize, large SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were flat approximately 24% in both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense. During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores, 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Peoria, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco. Before I turn it back over to Tom, I want to take a minute to talk about how it\u2019s an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn\u2019t be more proud of the progress that we made. Our store base has grown to 158 stores, and as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service and we have a world class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017, while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan, but we are never satisfied. And for those of you that have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case. For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how we want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visits came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they have always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign and we expect it will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers\u2019 needs. We are also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient and reducing waste throughout the company. We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you two quick examples of enhancements that we are developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember, we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year. And this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles that we ship annually. It is this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future. Tom? Tom Folliard : Thanks very much, Bill and Tom. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Tom Folliard : Hi Brian. Brian Nagel : First off, Tom, congratulations on your retirement, it\u2019s becoming and Bill, congratulations on the new appointment. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Brian. Brian Nagel : The question I have, I wanted to just talk about gross profit for a minute. Clearly, that\u2019s been a big focus of investors in light of what some of your competitors have been talking about declining gross profits, now we look at the numbers you reported, the results you reported today, so gross profit was down slightly, I don\u2019t know Tom, you probably say it\u2019s the noise with the $39 year-on-year, which...? Tom Folliard : I am. Brian Nagel : I answered that question first. Tom Folliard : What\u2019s your next question? Brian Nagel : The bigger question is, if you look at the drivers of that, kind of the puts and takes behind gross profit, have those changed at all and are you seeing any type of pressures out there that maybe, within your gross profit in the used vehicle space, that maybe more, maybe reflective of some of the pressures that others are seeing and you are handling those better? Tom Folliard : I mean, I think it\u2019s an overall inventory management process for us. And I think starts with the by having the right car in the right place at the right time. And that allows us to be able to deliver an exceptional value to the customer. And some of what I talked about last quarter, we talked some big SUVs are a little expensive, so we didn\u2019t buy them. We didn\u2019t buy as many. And that allows us to manage our margin, I think very efficiently. We transfer cars that customers requests. It\u2019s about a third of our sales. So that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We are big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of product all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that\u2019s reflected in the ultimate margins that we achieve and the sales that we get. So I am very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp based on one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along. I think we are better at managing our inventory and our margins than we were a few years ago. And with continued use of external and internal data and training and development of the process, I think we will just continue to get better at it. So I am pretty pleased with the progress that we have made and the results we have been able to deliver. Brian Nagel : Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Thanks Brian. Katharine Kenny : Thanks Brian. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Tom Folliard : Hi Sharon. Sharon Zackfia : I guess a question that we get asked a lot, so I will throw it at you. There seems to be some thought process that perhaps the new car dealers have figured out a way to be more aggressive on their gross profit per car target and make it up in some other part of their business and therefore become more of a competitive threat to you kind of by undercutting prices, I am just, the pervasive thought on Wall Street at this point and I am just wondering if you have any commentary, any context you could give us on that? Tom Folliard : Well, I think the biggest thing to look at is just our results and our volumes. During the quarter, our average stores sold around 340 cars a month per store. That\u2019s across the entire chain, including new stores. If you look at used car sales, our used car sales compared to the \u2013 I am only going to use the public new car deals as an example here, there are many more franchise deals, as you know. But we sold more used cars during the year than the next four competitors combined. So I feel like our consumer offer is clearly resonating with consumers and we are able to grow our business year-after-year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% for the full year, a very good number for a company of our size. And I think given the choice consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealers total for the year, used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers. And I think you have to look at it on a broader scale and not just focus on the publicly traded auto retailers because they are very small sliver of used car sales in the U.S. Sharon Zackfia : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Looking for an opinion, so why do think you guys are seeing a dip in credit apps at the low end of the spectrum? Tom Folliard : Scott, I am not sure that we really know, but I am not sure that that\u2019s not good for us. If you look at our mix of sales in Tier 3 in this quarter, we were down 2 points, so we are 17% of our sales last year\u2019s fourth quarter, 15% this year\u2019s fourth quarter. As you know, that\u2019s been less profitable slice of business for us. It\u2019s one that we are very comfortable being in, one that I have said in the past, I think we provide the best possible deal for customers in that credit segment and we are very happy to be able to deliver a great consumer experience and a high quality car to those customers. But if you look at a base from which to grow your business, if you had a little higher credit profile, it\u2019s not the worst thing. You have been around long enough to know that, that percent of sales for us was at one point is non-existent and it\u2019s gone from two to I think as high in 1 year as 19 might have been our highest full year. So we are down a couple of points for the year. You could argue that, that loss of credit apps, volume of apps hurts comps by a little bit, which it does, but it doesn\u2019t hurt profits by as much at it hurts the comp. So we continue to build our brand. We continue to advertise to get any consumer that want to come to CarMax, but it\u2019s not that bad if it shifts a couple of points in the other direction. But in terms of explaining the volume of applications, it\u2019s very difficult to do. Scott Ciccarelli : Got it. And just for context, is the Tier 2 guys still kind of dipping down, because that was something that you had suggested previously, where the Tier 2 guys were scooping up some of the stuff that would historically have fallen into the Tier 3 bucket? Tom Reedy : Yes. Scott, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I would say that we continue to see some pretty aggressive behavior from our Tier 2 lenders. And that combined with the lower number of low credit applications both of those impact Tier 3\u2019s ability to get customers, right. I mean, the byproducts of that is what they are seeing might be a little bit less than what they are seeing before. Tier 2, by the way is down slightly this quarter year-over-year as well. But \u2013 and as you saw cap was up and other meaning people will bring financing to the table, was up a couple of points also. So that just goes, falls right in line with the fact that we are seeing higher credit quality through the door that, that others up even more than CAF. Tom Folliard : And I think Scott, some of the shifting you are referring to is a reflection of our partners who are fantastic partners getting more and more experience with the CarMax origination channel and being more comfortable with how they originate. So that\u2019s nothing but good for us. Scott Ciccarelli : Got it. Alright. Thanks a lot guys. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question as well. It\u2019s on the wholesale business, wholesale volume growth decelerated to about 2% or 3%, are you seeing any impact at all from some of these emerging peer-to-peer remarketing channels or is there another dynamic at play? Tom Folliard : I don\u2019t know, I have said and it has been true over time that I think wholesale will grow approximately with sales over time. But it would never be exactly attached. If you look at over a multi-year window that has been true, it\u2019s very difficult to evaluate where \u2013 we had a buy rate of around 30% for the quarter. So that\u2019s about \u2013 that\u2019s as high as it gets for us. And we are very pleased with that. Some of the peer-to-peer stuff you are referring to are still very, very small, particularly compared to our size and then vary only in a few markets. So we haven\u2019t seen any impacts of any statistical significance that we could attribute directly. Craig Kennison : And as a follow-up to Bill, you mentioned the mobile appraisal platform you are piloting or starting soon, do you think that will drive volume at wholesale as well? Bill Nash : The intention of the website isn\u2019t necessarily drop wholesale volume other than highlight the appraisal process. So if we highlight the appraisal process, inherently that will end up driving some wholesale traffic. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to ask you about the performance of your new stores, I know that our ability to measure them is not perfect, but it seems like the volume productivity per unit for the vintage that\u2019s opened over the past year is down. Is there something about timing that would make a difference? Is there something about the markets that you are entering that would make a difference, because it just seems like anyway you slice that the used vehicle units per average new opening are a bit lower than they have been in years past? Tom Folliard : Remember, we have small format stores mixed in there too, which are a fraction of what some of our biggest stores are. And also as a percent of our opening, I mean, as a percent of our stores that we are opening each year, the last few years that number is actually going down, because we have been consistent at that \u201814, \u201815 number. So this year, the amount of stores we opened as a percentage of the base has gone down. So, you would expect the percentage of units delivered from the new stores to go down unless we increase the number of stores that we build and we change the profile of the size. What I would tell you is that we are continuing to open stores, because they are delivering a great return. And remember that we have very long models for sales, 30 plus years. And we have some stores \u2013 we have a whole batch of stores now that are less than 5 years old and are still on their growth curve. So, we are pleased with the performance of the new stores, that\u2019s why we keep opening them and we think they are delivering a great return. But mathematically, it\u2019s not going to deliver as much to the total, because it\u2019s less of the base. And then remember some of our big old stores are very big. Matthew Fassler : I guess, I follow up by saying that even if you adjust for store size which we do and you adjust for the role that newer stores have in the mix as a percent of the base, you do all the math, it looks like this less vintage from a unit perspective was a little off. So, if you think about some of the new markets like Boston and you just tell us what you see, it is the unit count kind of in like sized stores different from it had been? And if you think the trajectory in some of those markets is going to be different, why would that be the case? Tom Folliard : Well, I haven\u2019t looked at. We really \u2013 we look at it on a \u2013 when we build the store, do we think its on pace to deliver a great return and we are comfortable with the stores we have been building. Boston has been open for 4 or 5 months. We would never make any determination on any market after 4 or 5 months having done this for 23 years. I can just say we are pleased with the openings and that\u2019s why we keep building them. Matthew Fassler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please go ahead. James Albertine : Great. Thanks for taking the question as well. I wanted to understand I don\u2019t think I heard a comment about it, apologies if I missed it, comment around traffic for the quarter. And what I am trying to get at here is as your online traffic grows, how do you think that impacts consumer\u2019s decision to visit stores or multiple stores? And do you think and in fact, there could be some cannibalization going on as it relates to them? Thanks. Tom Folliard : Well, there is \u2013 I didn\u2019t mention traffic specifically. I did mention that our comps for the quarter were driven by conversion. So, our traffic through the door was down slightly and our traffic \u2013 and our conversion was up slightly delivering a 0.7 comp for the quarter. In terms of the goal of the website and the goal of driving traffic, it\u2019s twofold. One is to drive just raw traffic and the other one is to improve the likelihood of the traffic that shows up to buy a car. So, if a customer \u2013 as Bill mentioned, if a customer wants to do more of the process from home, they have those tools available on our website that can be more prepared when they show up. And to be honest with you, it doesn\u2019t matter to us whether we get a few less customers who are a lot more likely to buy or more customers that are just as equally likely to buy. So, it\u2019s very difficult to measure that, but it\u2019s kind of a multifaceted goal with the website. People are doing a lot of research online. There is a lot of data out there that\u2019s telling you that people are visiting less stores than they used to before they buy a car. So, it\u2019s really, really important that our website provides a great education for the customer and when they show up, they are more likely to buy. So, that\u2019s kind of the goal of the website is to educate and then to deliver customers to the store and hopefully, they are more likely to buy. James Albertine : I appreciate that color. If I may, just a follow-up on that topic. Do you envision a point at which the entire transaction will be possible online? And as it relates to that, is there anything that you are seeing either among competitors or among your own consumers and what they are telling you they desire that would accelerate spending around online versus your anticipated spending maybe a quarter or a few quarters ago? Thanks. Tom Folliard : Well, Bill mentioned enhancements to the website and continuing to improve our mobile experience for our customers. So, if you look at where we are spending our dollars, there is no doubt, it\u2019s shifting towards mobile, it\u2019s shifting towards the website, because that\u2019s where our customers are, that\u2019s where we need to make sure that we meet them however they want to be met. And we want to make sure that they have the capabilities to do parts of the transaction or all of the transaction online. I will tell you that the average customer at CarMax has a trade in. The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity, and it\u2019s not as easy to do a $20,000 transaction that is multifaceted, which oftentimes includes appraising the car that they are driving and do the entire transaction online. I am not saying that we won\u2019t do that and we won\u2019t have those capabilities, but that\u2019s a sliver of the customers that we actually deal with. And what we are really, really good at in our stores is helping people find the right car that they need and the budget that they can afford, matching them up with the right credit offer, making sure we give them a fair offer for their trade in, which almost always requires looking at the car and making a fair offer after you have assessed its condition. So, we are going to continue to drive towards giving the consumer more and more capability to do whatever they want to do online and it may someday include consummating the whole transaction, but there is a large segment of customers who really can\u2019t do the whole transaction online due to those other pieces that I mentioned. James Albertine : That\u2019s great color as always. Thanks so much and I will get back in queue. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hey, guys. Good morning. I just want to ask about the comp side of things and what it is maybe that you are seeing out there that can help the comps to continue to sequentially accelerate. When you think about the 0.7 is definitely better than what we are looking for is encouraging. But do we need more used car price declines from Manheim or how should we think about the leverage that is in place to get to 4% plus? Tom Folliard : Again, that\u2019s a \u2013 there are multiple things that go into stores comping and the comp base. Remember, we continue to build stores that back into existing markets, which hurts comps. We continue to \u2013 as Bill mentioned, we continue invest in our website to drive more customers to our store. We continue to advertise to build our brand. I feel like everything that we do as a company, working on efficiencies, trying to lower our cost, trying to keep our prices competitive will deliver comps over a long period of time. I think we have shown the ability to grow a very big base of business over a very long period of time and I expect to be able to do that in the future, but there isn\u2019t really one button that you push to drive comps. I talked earlier about margin management and inventory management and having the right car in the right place at the right time. All of those things contribute to comps and those are things that we are focused on as a company to continue to improve. Michael Montani : Okay. And just in terms of the quarter where we saw the GPUs come down a little bit, but the comps accelerate a bit, I mean, how should we think about that trade-off then going forward? How would you describe the fourth quarter on those two metrics and the balance thereof? Tom Folliard : With the first question, we have managed our margins pretty consistently over a period of time. I think the margins were down $39ish for the quarter year-over-year. That\u2019s within our level of ability to manage. So, I have always said we would \u2013 we tried to do as much price testing as we can and we try to balance margin and sales. And we are pretty pleased with the results for the quarter, but that\u2019s how we will continue to look at it going forward. Michael Montani : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, Tom and Bill and Katherine and thank you very much or I mean congratulations on your retirement and Bill, your promotion. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I wanted to ask you about gross profit per unit. So at my family\u2019s dealerships, we are going to do over 5,000 used cars this year. I can tell you if you pickup the phone and you called anybody at our dealerships today, they would look forward to or will be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They would be very pleased, because that means our cost for goods sold would go down. Therefore, the gross profit would likely go up, because of spread between new car prices and used car prices would increase and the volume will go up because of simple price elasticity demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that for some reason. My question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though during periods of time, when gross or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which has kind of counted what happens at our dealerships. And I am wondering, do you have any idea or first of all, what\u2019s your sense or what\u2019s going to happen to your gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim Index goes down? And then secondly, can you explain what appears at least to my mind to be a bit of an anomaly that took place kind of in that before the last downturn? Tom Folliard : I am not really sure where you ended up there, but our margin\u2026 Brett Hoselton : Let me simplify it. Tom Folliard : I will just say I will answer it. Our margin dollars have been very consistent. When the Manheim Index goes down and we can buy cars cheaper, we want to give our customers a better deal. So we have chosen whether it\u2019s right or wrong to not increase our margins when our prices go down because we want to give our customers a better deal. And we are building our business over a very, very long period of time and we want them to leave and say, why I got a really fantastic deal. The next time I buy a car I want to buy it from CarMax. So you can argue with our motives but when our \u2013 when our ability to buy a car is cheaper, we have chosen to pass those savings onto our customers as opposed to taking it into margin. That\u2019s just what we have done. The biggest example I can give you is during the recession, our average retail price dropped by over $2,000 in three months and we kept our margins and we bought cars cheaper over that period of time by that same amount and we chose to keep our margins flat. That\u2019s just the decision that we made. I think we gave a whole bunch of customers a great deal and hopefully made customers alike. That\u2019s how we have chosen to run our business. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will do it exactly that way going forward. But when we have the ability to buy cars cheaper, we pass those savings onto our customers. Brett Hoselton : Okay. So maybe the quite simple question would be if the Manheim Index were to go down by 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, or something along those lines, you do not anticipate that your gross profit per unit is going to go down, you probably will maintain that and just simply increase your volumes, is that conceptually how you think about the\u2026? Tom Folliard : Now, every market condition has different variables and we evaluate all of them and we try to make the decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what\u2019s going to look like going forward. You can look at our history. And we watch depreciation go up, down, Manheim Index go all over the place and we managed our business very consistently through that time. And each time we see a downturn or an up-tick or appreciation or depreciation, we evaluate all those variables and we try to make the best decision we can. Brett Hoselton : Yes. So I guess maybe asking it in a different way, you do not anticipate making less gross profit when the Manheim Index goes down? Tom Folliard : I just answered that question. Brett Hoselton : Great. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Levin : Good morning, guys. It\u2019s actually Mike Levin on for Rod. Tom Folliard : Hi Mike. Mike Levin : Congratulations again, Tom on your retirement. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Mike Levin : I think over time, your guys sales have correlated much better with new car sales versus used cars and we are looking at expectations for new car SAAR in the U.S. moving forward, most people are expecting sort of a flat towing demand environment, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts around how you think about CarMax\u2019s growth within that sort of plateauing SAAR? Tom Folliard : Well, I have always \u2013 I have said this before that I think that largely, we move directionally with SAAR, but it\u2019s not an exact science. And making a forward-looking prediction on SAAR is something that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not something that we really do. And what we focus on is trying to deliver the best deal and the best consumer offer that we can each and every day. And I can\u2019t really comment on what\u2019s going to happen over the next 12 months or 24 months depending on movement in SAAR. I think it\u2019s nice to see new car sales back up to where they were pre-recession. If you actually track new car sales and correlate it with population growth, I think the SAAR is still pretty low. So there are lots of different estimates about what\u2019s going to happen over the next year. We are just going to try and do the best job we can based on the conditions that we see. Mike Levin : Great. And then just within some of the pool data we have seen losses, delinquencies, tick-up slightly, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on where we are in terms of credit availability or things beginning to tighten and how \u2013 when rates are moving up, how do you kind of see that impacting both the CAF business and your ability to finance your customers moving forward? Tom Reedy : Right, I guess I can only speak specifically to what we have seen through year end. And if you are asking about CAF portfolio where there is nothing going on there that we see that caused us any concern. It\u2019s been pretty much business as usual. With regard to the partners, the reason we have a number of them because we want to keep a broad spectrum of credit available to our customers. We continue to see greater than 96% of customers who submit an application and get some kind of approval in our stores. So the way I would characterize, it\u2019s greater than 90%. The way I would characterized our availability through the fourth quarter is as good as ever. And as Tom mentioned, we pick a long-term perspective with our partners. We would try to be a good partner. We believe we have developed an origination channel that is spirit to others as far as originating loans for new cares, for used card and new cars, use the transparency and the integrity of the channel. It\u2019s proven out in the past that our partners have seen better performance on their pool rigidly out of CarMax than elsewhere. We have seen in the past that they preferred to allocate capital to us when times have gotten tough. And as we look forward, we would hope that our work in our long-term relationships and the integrity of the channel would make it such that we continue to see that kind of preference for CarMax. Tom Folliard : I think \u2013 does that answer question about availability or... Mike Levin : Yes, I think so. I will hop back and get back in queue. Tom Folliard : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Good morning. This is Liz Suzuki on for John. Just looking at the different buckets of SG&A, what portion is generally associated with existing stores or just new stores and what is typically comprised by advertising and stock-based comp, just trying I think going forward about how we should think about operating leverage backing out the impact of stock-based comp and new stores openings? Tom Folliard : Liz, I don\u2019t know that we have divided it, that we have talked about it that way before. So I am not sure I can answer that. But what \u2013 can you ask the question again? Liz Suzuki : Sure. Yes. I was just thinking about like what percentage of SG&A is generally associated with new stores if you are opening 15 or so per year versus your existing stores and just trying to think about leverage going forward? Tom Folliard : Yes, I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but \u2013 because I don\u2019t have it handy. But there is no doubt that new stores on a per-unit basis are significantly SG&A inefficient compared to existing stores, because they are new, because they have higher advertising expense to start, because they are not mature. So if you think about the newer stores, there is no question that they are much more inefficient from an SG&A standpoint on a per unit basis than the older stores. And when you want \u2013 you talk about leverage. We have always talked about while we are growing the business, while we are spending the CapEx that we are spending to build 15 stores a year, we need a few points of comps to leverage SG&A at that growth rate. I don\u2019t know if that provides the color you are looking for. Tom Reedy : Yes. Liz, another way to look at it is, if you look back over time and you see the growth in SG&A, around half I mean coming from new stores and the rest is coming from... Tom Folliard : Of the growth. Tom Reedy : Of the growth itself, yes. Liz Suzuki : Okay, it\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead. Bill Armstrong : Good morning gentlemen. Just a question about SUV inventory availability, the expectations are that we are going to see more vehicles coming into the market from off lease and other sources as we move through the year and maybe price starts to come down, as you are going through the options, are you seeing any indication of that yet and to what extent can you maybe source maybe a little bit more through consumers, any leverage you may be able to pull there? Tom Folliard : I can only comment through February. And SUVs have always been a big percentage of our mix. During the quarter, as Bill mentioned, mid-size and large SUVs were around 24%, roughly a fourth of our sales. I think as I have said before with the high volume of off lease product that means there is going to be a high volume of off-lease product coming back into the market at some point. And I think that there is an opportunity or a chance that, that will create some great deals and some great opportunities to buy, which will allow us to then turnaround and give great deals to our customers. But that\u2019s no different than any segment of our inventory. We are very opportunistic. We turn our inventory very quickly. And we try pass on the best deal we can possibly can to our customers. So it\u2019s still a fourth \u2013 it was a fourth of our sales during the quarter. If we see lease volumes, lease turn in starts to pick up, which I would expect they will like they always do when you see such a high percentage of new cars that are leased, we will be the ones that are standing there able to take advantage of that and provide great deals to our customers. Bill Armstrong : Are you seeing any significant change in the mix that you are sourcing from consumers versus wholesale? Tom Folliard : No I mean you know that a lot of \u2013 a big percentage that we buy comes directly from consumers and the rest comes from auctions and other. So when you see a 24% mix of SUVs, that\u2019s probably about the same from both. Bill Armstrong : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Katharine Kenny : Good morning. Tom Folliard : Hi Seth. Seth Basham : My question first relates to the balance between market share and profitability. If you could benchmark your results against the industry according to NADA, well, I appreciate that you gained market share overall for the year. The last couple of quarters it appears that you have lost market share, particularly a benchmark against comparable stores. As you think about balancing that relative to profitability going forward, what do you favor, do you favor maintaining market share or taking a little bit of hit on profitability? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s a tough question. I think to use the word optimal is the way I would go and I am not really sure of what that is. I will tell you, I don\u2019t know where you get your data, but we have never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I am not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There is 40 million cars sold annually, roughly a third are sold from customer to customer and it\u2019s very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult. As big as we are and I noted some of those numbers earlier, we are a tiny share of 0 to 10-year-old cars nationally, somewhere in the 2% range. So, I don\u2019t know that focusing on share is the right place to spend your energy, because it\u2019s so difficult to ascertain what share actually is. And again, the business is so fragmented you could be as big as we are and have just a fractional share. Even in the markets that we are in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it\u2019s around 5, but remember too that for us, we self select out of a bunch of inventory that\u2019s included in the denominator. We don\u2019t retail anything over 120,000 miles. So, there is a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them and we sell them through our auction. That doesn\u2019t count a share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don\u2019t count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So, we are evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth. So, it\u2019s a very good question. But there is such fragmentation I don\u2019t really know how to think about it. Seth Basham : Okay. I guess\u2026 Tom Folliard : We are just trying to optimize our sales. We are trying to grow our business. We are trying to comp our stores and deliver a great return for our shareholders. Seth Basham : Okay, fair enough. Just as a follow-up, if you look at your profit per unit, obviously, it declined pretty substantially relative to the last few years on a year-over-year basis. You may see that as noise, but do you see that as a driver potentially to boost your sales going forward and would you be more willing to see further declines in order to boost your sales? Tom Folliard : I am sorry, Seth, did you say gross margin? Seth Basham : Gross profit per vehicle. Tom Folliard : Yes. I mean, it was down \u2013 as I said it was down less than $40 and that\u2019s within our kind of our ability to manage. And as I have always said, we will do what we think is in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. And I can\u2019t really tell you what we are going to do with margins going forward other than we have been pretty consistent with it over the last several years. Seth Basham : Thank you. Tom Folliard : And been able to deliver comps at the same time, so... Seth Basham : Thanks, guys. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Paresh Jain : Good morning, everyone. I had a question about GPU as it relates to source of inventory. When we think about the retail inventory channel, it looks like you probably saw as much from auctions as you do to through in-store places, but the auction channel being a lot \u2013 relatively a lot less profitable. So, a lot of this increase in off-lease supply expected to show up at auctions or franchise dealers. Is that a way for you to offset any GPU pressure resulting from it? Tom Folliard : Well, a lot of those cars also show up in the auction too remember. So, a lot of customers who are coming off a lease will shop at our store and if we make them an offer that gets them out of their car and makes them a little bit of money a lot of times, because we see a lot of lease trade-ins come to our store in the form of appraisals. So, I can\u2019t give you an exact answer, but what I can tell you is, our percent of cars that we sell, that we retail which we call self-sufficiency has been in the low 30s and it\u2019s been as high as I think the low 50s. And it moves around over time depending on a whole bunch of different variables. And what we have gotten, I think pretty good at, is being able to manage our margins despite the fact that we expect some movement there. So, I can\u2019t predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen when leases \u2013 when lease volumes at the auction pick up, but it\u2019s not just lease volumes at the auction. Remember, it\u2019s all these cars coming back into the marketplace in a number of different ways. Paresh Jain : Understood. I will get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Please go ahead. Nick Zangler : Hey, guys. This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. Just building off that question, earlier you mentioned that some trucks, crossover SUVs were too expensive to buy last quarter. Are you still finding that to be the case? I mean, obviously, this product category continues to be in high demand. And just given that, are you able to get the truck crossover SUV inventory that you want? Tom Folliard : As I said, it\u2019s a fourth of our sales. I mean, it\u2019s a huge chunk of sales. And I would say the answer is largely yes. I talked about it last quarter. I thought it would have had a fractional impact on us and I was mostly focused on larger SUVs that were just very, very expensive, but if you look at the Manheim Index through from then to now, prices have come down a little bit. But we are always going to try to do what we think is the best value for our customers. But I mean, it\u2019s a huge chunk of our sales. Nick Zangler : Yes. And given that \u2013 but do you attribute any of the traffic decline to having to a lack of truck SUV inventory, I guess? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s almost impossible to do that, but I would say no. Nick Zangler : Okay. Alright, great. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the off-lease topic for a moment, what about on the dealer side? I know that made a lot more emphasis on trying to retail rather than auction themselves and I know they can\u2019t corner the market, but are you concerned that it could cause you guys to not get quite as much as the overall inventory over the next few year as you normally would in this part of the cycle? Tom Folliard : I can only go by what\u2019s happened in the past and it has never inhibited us before. David Whiston : Okay. Tom Folliard : It\u2019s usually the cars are more organized at the auction. David Whiston : Okay. And going back to an earlier question on online versus brick-and-mortar, I wanted to look at that more from the perspective of these startups like shifts. They compete more in a non-store front test bring the vehicle to the consumer\u2019s home with the sales associate. I am sure you want to stay more in the brick-and-mortar side with an online experience to get, to drive store traffic. But is this format something that you are just kind of dismissing for now, because they are so small relative to you or do you think that\u2019s a type of the experience you would want to offer your customers down the road with a much larger selection? Tom Folliard : No, we actually just \u2013 we have recently tested home delivery. So, we have done some home delivery on a very small test in the market. We will continue to evaluate it going forward. Anything that we see anybody doing that we think would benefit our customers. We are going to evaluate whether or not it makes sense for us. As I mentioned earlier, the one thing to remember is many, many, many transactions involved the acquisition of the customer\u2019s existing car. Something we are very, very good at and I think it gives us a competitive advantage. Some of these smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory and whether actually you are taking any ownership of the inventory, we actually think having 50,000 cars online is a huge advantage for us in providing a great selection for customers and a multifaceted selection when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can\u2019t quite afford the car that they thought. So, I don\u2019t think anybody is in a better position than we are to deliver more and more of the transaction online and/or even delivering to someone\u2019s home than CarMax can, because we have the infrastructure in place. As I said earlier, I am not sure how big a piece of our total sales it will be, but we are going to be in a position to do whatever the customer wants us to do. David Whiston : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Irina Hodakovsky : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on your retirement, Tom and welcome aboard, Bill. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Irina Hodakovsky : I wanted to ask you a little bit of a small details question, SG&A expense. You mentioned you were rolling out in your website through the fiscal 2015 it should be fully rolled out by the end of this month. One would imagine it was probably a bit of a headwind to the SG&A cost. Can we expect an improvement as this initiative is finished and can we expect it to maybe even drive a tailwind? Tom Folliard : Really, that\u2019s just \u2013 Bill talked about the website we designed, that\u2019s one initiative within our spend. We think we can continue to deliver a great value to our customers and continue to deliver our return to our shareholders and invest at the level that we need to make the improvement that we think are necessary to grow the business. So, if there is significant investment in IT? Yes, but there was the last 10 years also and we expect it to be a big investment for us going forward. As we said, we want to make sure we meet the customer where they want to be met. But we think within our big bucket of SG&A spend we can both invest and deliver a good return for our shareholders. Irina Hodakovsky : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Fassler : I am back guys. Thank you for taking my follow-ups. Two very quick questions for you. It looks like your compensation expense per used vehicle unit, even excluding stock-based comp was down a bit, is there any change in comp practices or was incentive compensation a piece of moving the needle there? Tom Folliard : There is a number of different things, Matt. I think we had \u2013 as you look at this year is a little weaker than last year and so there is less incentive compensation that I have forgotten that, yes. Matthew Fassler : Any reversals as part of that or just lower accruals over the course of the quarter? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s just been a weaker year relative to plan. Matthew Fassler : Fair enough. And then my second and last question, any change in the stance of your sub-prime providers and the standards that they are bringing to the market change? And I know your traffic is down in some of the lower quality credit regions, but in terms of their willingness if you could kind of the standards that they are upholding as they extend credit, I mean, anything you have seen there? Tom Folliard : Yes, Matt. As I said earlier, I can only speak to what we have seen through year end. And we have been happy with the performance of our Tier 3 partners. They have done a great job for us. I would say that their conversion on applications is a little bit down. But if we look at a like type of credit that they are seeing come through the door that their behavior has been very consistent over the course of the year. So, while we may not see them converting as many people, because their offers might be weaker, that\u2019s more of a byproduct of the fact that what they are seeing is weaker than how their behavior has been. And as far as how they go forward, we want them to run a business that\u2019s profitable and sustainable so that they can support our customers and we will keep an eye for the long-term. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on CapEx, you would say that the 4.50, which is pretty meaningful year-over-year increase, has lot to do with timing of land acquisitions and construction activity. How much of the year-over-year increase can we kind of think of as growth in kind of core CapEx versus timing? And then subsequently, should we think about CapEx being down into fiscal 2018? Tom Folliard : Yes, almost all of the increase is timing and we would expect to not be aside the following year. Rod Lache : Got it. So, then maybe that same magnitude come back down to sort of where we have been running and... Tom Folliard : I mean, we couldn\u2019t give you an exact number, but yes, we don\u2019t expect it to be that number the following year. Tom Reedy : Yes, I think remember Rod, these deals take a long time to put together and we had a few of the slips from this year into next year that we would have expected to cost the money up on this year. And if things take longer than expected, you might get concentrated in one year versus the other. And if things accelerate, you find opportunities that you need to close on faster the same could be true, but... Tom Folliard : Yes, and I think that because it \u2013 we are at this 15ish store year pace, you need to really be working on 60ish pieces of property to deliver that. So, when you get a CapEx number from us, it\u2019s our best estimate of the next 12 months. But as Tom said, there is some timing, there is some shifting back and forth, but this differential between the year that we are telling you about which is the upcoming year compared to last year is almost all timing. Rod Lache : Great. I really appreciate the clarity guys. Thanks. Tom Folliard : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Please go ahead. Bill Armstrong : Good morning. My question also was on CapEx and you have been able to over time reduce your overall cost of new stores, reducing the footprint through more efficiency. I was wondering if you could just maybe update us on what the trends are there? Are you still able to get maybe little bit less cost on an average per store basis? How should we think about that when looking for CapEx? Tom Folliard : The big piece you left out there is the land part of it and that\u2019s not something we really have a lot of control over. But in terms of value engineering our store so that they are both as efficient to build as possible and then as efficient to run as possible, those are the things we are hyper-focused on. But when you look at our openings for the last couple of years and the next couple of years, we are going to do some pretty expensive big metro markets. We have opened Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston and Denver in the last couple of years. And in the next couple, we have San Francisco and Seattle coming. So oftentimes, in a place like that, the land acquisition price is going to overwhelm the store build in some cases. So, we are really focused on building as efficient as we can, but the answer is I think we are building a more efficient box than we used to, but it\u2019s hard to really discern when you look at the total CapEx. Bill Armstrong : That makes sense. Thanks very much. Tom Folliard : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brett Hoselton : Hey, guys. Just two quick follow-up questions. One, can you provide us with an update of your sub-prime pilot kind of where you are at, do you have a particular direction that you think you are heading at this point? And then secondly, can you provide us with just some very rough examples of where your market share is at in maybe some of your mature markets? Tom Reedy : I will take the sub-prime. As I said in my comments and in the release, we continue to be comfortable with where we are at and we are going to continue at the same pace with Tier 3 volume, which is about 5% of the Tier 3 volume that we felt throughout the stores. The sub-prime test, we haven\u2019t learned anything that scares us about it. In fact, we believe it\u2019s a profitable business. But there is more to the equation around risk and what we want to do with the company going forward. So, I think the way to characterize it is it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s about 1% or less of our total portfolio. But all the reasons that we decided to go into this test are still holding true and we need to continue to get knowledge about this space and these customers and we are going to make sure that we are in a position that we can mitigate risk to the extent we need to. And from that perspective, I think we are comfortable kind of steady as you go. Tom Folliard : And I am sorry, your second question was? Brett Hoselton : So, your overall market share across the United States is 1% to 2%, can you provide us as examples of where your market share might be in mature markets? Tom Folliard : Sure. So again, I talked about the challenges around market share, but it\u2019s about 2%. If you look at it nationally which includes the places that were not. It\u2019s about 5% on average. Remember, our 0 to 10-year-old cars and I talked some about the challenges of the denominator. It\u2019s about 5% in the markets that we are in. And it\u2019s between 10% and 15% in our most mature markets. So, it is no doubt that there is a ramping and a growing over time that\u2019s a combination of comp sales and adding stores into new markets. So, we have seen in our older markets that we can be in the double-digits on share of 0 to 10-year-old cars. Brett Hoselton : Let me ask you maybe just maybe a broader conceptual question. So, let\u2019s say your mature markets you are in the 10% to 15% range, your next competitor I mean to guess is maybe less than 1% of the market. So, it seems as though you, to be blunt, have an impenetrable near monopoly in your mature markets. Would you disagree with that or would you say that look we really feel very strongly that we have got a very, very strong model? Tom Folliard : I think we have a very, very strong model. I think monopoly would be a word I wouldn\u2019t use. Brett Hoselton : That\u2019s fair. Tom Folliard : But I mean our average numbers speak for themselves. As I said earlier, our average stores \u2013 this is our average, including all of our new stores in the quarter sold about 340 cars a month. The average new car dealer who generally are the next biggest and there is variability by market. There is some places where there is independents that have some significant sales. But generally new car dealers that sell used cars we would consider the next biggest and the average nationally is around 40 or 50 cars a month, so that the size differential is kind of true for us in most places. Brett Hoselton : Well, again, Tom, congratulations on your retirement. Bill, congratulations. I tell you, Tom, you have built a tremendous franchise here. So, congratulations. Tom Folliard : Thank you. And really, I really didn\u2019t do anything. I was along for the ride with a bunch of really great people. And I am still going to be here for a little while longer. So \u2013 but listen, that\u2019s all we have today. Thank you guys very much for joining the call and thanks to all of our associates at CarMax for delivering such a great customer experience and we will talk to you next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Victoria and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, Victoria and good morning. Thank you all for joining our fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nash, President; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As always, I hope you will all remember to ask only one question and follow-up before getting back in the queue in order to give everyone a chance to ask a question. Before I turn it over to Tom, I just want to say how about those Cavs? Tom? Tom Folliard : Thank you, Katharine who has a hometown of Cleveland as you can tell. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. As usual, I will start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter. Tom Reedy will then give some more detail around financing and we will turn over to Bill Nash who will share some additional information regarding the quarter. First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us. Total revenues increased by 2.8%. Used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominantly and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion. For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%. Wholesale units grew by 1.8%. CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million. And net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90. During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million. I will now turn the call over to Tom to talk about finance. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with last two quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end. Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF\u2019s net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax\u2019s sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to the lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space. Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a combination of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit tightening by our third-party lenders. As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year\u2019s first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year\u2019s favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unfavorable loss experience this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in wholesale recovery rate. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managed receivables compared to 0.94% in last year\u2019s first quarter and at 0.99% last quarter. This loss reserve is within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that\u2019s consistent with the last couple of quarters. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million \u2013 turning over to CarMax overall now. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY \u201816. This was partially due to higher average debt levels that more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing. During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we will fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization. I will turn over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thanks, Tom. Good morning. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles remained essentially flat compared to last year at approximately 77%. Midsize and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year\u2019s first quarter remained flat compared to the fourth quarter. SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense. Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223. During our last call, I highlighted some of the advancements we are making to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we would be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April. It combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer\u2019s individual preferences. We will also continue to test different components of selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we are currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being pre-qualified for financing before the store visit helps build the customer\u2019s confidence and will make the in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores. We continue to believe that no one is in a better position than CarMax to deliver more of the transactions online or even deliver the car to the home. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine a state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for is what will set us apart from our competitors. During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets, one in Springfield, Illinois and one in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open two more stores, one in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us and the other will be our third store in the Boston market. Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning guys, can you hear me? Tom Folliard : Yes. Hi John. John Murphy : Just maybe a longer term question just to kind of follow-up on what you were just talking about your enhanced website, do you foresee a time where your store count is not necessarily growing as quickly as you are expecting right now, but you are reaching a broader set of consumers, quite simplistically I mean do need as many stores to cover a market as you do now if you kind of increased this physical presence and can you go a lot more asset light as the business emerges over time? Tom Folliard : Yes. John, I think it\u2019s important that we do both very well. So I think in the short-term, we don\u2019t have any intentions of changing up our growth as far as the physical stores as we said in the past, 13 to 16 stores is what we have committed to for this year and next year. And we think that\u2019s to be ultimately successful, you need to have a really good presence in both. And so I think for us, it\u2019s going to be a combination of continuing to expand our offering online and then continuing to evolve our in-store process. Could we get to a point down the road where that may change up, that\u2019s hard to tell at this point. John Murphy : And these efforts aren\u2019t having any impact on your showroom traffic, are they at this point? Tom Folliard : No, I think when you think about traffic, foot traffic, it\u2019s broadly known that consumers are being much more informed before they come into the store. So they are doing a lot of the research upfront. In our case, we know nine out of ten of our consumers that end up purchasing from us do some homework ahead of time from \u2013 on carmax.com. So what we do think is they are coming in more informed. And as we look out and try to continue to get comps comes, we are going to be focused both on traffic, both in-store traffic to the web and then equally focused on conversion. John Murphy : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Tom Folliard : Good morning Scoot. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, I guess my primary question is on the cap side and we did see obviously, a pickup in the loan loss reserves, where \u2013 how would you expect that to trend for the balance of the year given some of the unfavorable changes you saw happen during the course of the quarter? Tom Reedy : Yes. Scot, one thing I would point out is that what we have booked in the quarter and is now booked in reserve is the 12-month look forward on losses. And our negative experience during the quarter is baked into our forecast direct for the rest of the year. So to the extent things were to worsen or improve, we would adjust accordingly. But at this point, everything we know about the environment including the experience we had in this quarter and having losses coming a little hot is baked into that forward-looking estimate. When you see the increase in that provision for loan losses, it\u2019s a combination of both our experience in the quarter versus our expectation of what we had booked and an adjustment to the overall portfolio based on what we have learned. So as I said at this point, I think everything that we have learned based on methodology is baked in. Scot Ciccarelli : So when you kind of peel back the onion a little bit Tom, is it more a recent vintages or is it older vintages or is it kind of across the board? Tom Reedy : I think it\u2019s a combination of things, Scot. In general, if you step back and look at it, last year\u2019s experience was very favorable. So I don\u2019t think we would have expected to have a repeat of that, so that\u2019s kind of the first point. We have also seen pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years though we have been expanding at the lower end of what CAF has done with some testing and some I guess prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss back in line with where we have tried to run it at that 2% to 2.5%, which is a very highly financeable portfolio. So I think it\u2019s fair to say that activity in the last couple of years, we have gotten a bit more aggressive internationally. And we get compensated for that with higher rates. And some of that has \u2013 you would have maybe expectation and that would increase losses in the portfolio. But we did have some unfavorable experience in the quarter as I mentioned due to \u2013 partially due to that expansion and partially due to the wholesale recovery rate. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it, okay. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Before I begin I just want to say I consider Katharine the LeBron of Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, Craig. Craig Kennison : And my question is just a follow-up on the prequalifying buyers online, could you share more detail on what is required to do that, how long it takes and how you plan to handle sort of a disappointing outcomes and if someone who doesn\u2019t get what they want? Thanks. Tom Folliard : Yes. So like I said we are currently just testing it, getting ready to put it in ten stores, really what we want to do is, we are going to a prequalify them or they come into the store. We have the sales consultant involved in the process. So if someone\u2019s decline, we can \u2013 we will contact the customer. And again, the goal will be not only to give them an approval, but to also transition them into the store at this point. Craig Kennison : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. If you think about the lower subprime penetration, this is a bit of an acceleration in the decline year-on-year in terms of penetration and do you expect declines to persist at this level, do you feel that your third-party providers are seeing similar experience to you and are in the process of pulling back further, do you feel like you have reached a stable level here? Tom Folliard : Yes. Matt, it\u2019s hard to say what we expect in the future. As I have always said our goal is to have sustainable partners that are there for our customers and can provide a wide range of financing. In the quarter though we did see one line in particular a pullback and it was Santander I mean you have seen them out in the public domain, talking about how they are pulling back in sub-prime auto, letting other business to other folks. So it\u2019s not inconsistent with what they have been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happened during the quarter. And I feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, it\u2019s their business, they are going to manage their portfolio as they see fit. And if they determine they need to dial back or get more aggressive, they are going to do that. I think Matt there is \u2013 out of the long time you know that sub-prime as a percentage of our total sales has at one point, it was pretty much zero. It\u2019s been as high as 19 in a year and then I think last year, we ended at 16 or 16 for the year. So wherever it ends up is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we have always talked about with this phase is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these points of sale are also significantly less profitable, that\u2019s one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, then the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is incremental because of the way we were up we flow financing from lender to lender. But at the same time, it\u2019s going to move around based on a whole bunch of different factors. Matt Fassler : Totally understood and if I could just follow-up very briefly on this point, to the extent that Tier 2 extensions fell a bit and you talked about more consumers coming in with their own \u2013 other cash for their own versus credit, is there \u2013 are there other competitors, we are kind of hearing two different things in this sense, is to some degree, interest among low end is down and their willingness to extend credit, to the low income consumers down, on the other it does seem like perhaps on this competing away, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the middle part of the market or other consumers who might otherwise shop through Tier 2, so any kind of holistic comments on whether the competition is increasing in any part of the credit spectrum? Tom Folliard : Well firstly, do remember that traffic of that FICO score applicant is down, so it kind of starts with traffic, I will let Tom comment on competition. Tom Reedy : Yes. As far as Tier 2 goes Matt, I think we mentioned last quarter that we thought some of the Tier 3 degradation was due to their Tier 2s aggressiveness or at least there is the competitiveness. We have not seen any degradation in the quality of offers that the Tier \u2013 our Tier 2 partners are providing or the aggressiveness or even their conversion to sale rate, which in fact it\u2019s better than it has been in the past couple of years. It\u2019s just they are not seeing quite the same volume they were before. So the decline in Tier 2, I would say completely on the flow of traffic and we are very happy with how they have been performing in the quarter. We were looking on that but\u2026 Matt Fassler : And the final follow-up, to the extent that Tier 3 traffic is down or are these consumers essentially anticipating a lot of credit availability given that this has been perhaps, brewing the market for a little while or is that customer finding a better deal elsewhere saying buy here, pay here channel or somewhere like that? Tom Reedy : It\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s almost impossible for us to tell, Matt. Matt Fassler : Okay. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hi guys. Good morning. Just wanted to ask if I could, can you provide some additional color on the recovery rate experience versus gross charge-offs in the quarter, specifically as it relates to the provisioning? Tom Folliard : I can give you a little color on the recovery rate. It was down about 5 points year-over-year, so it\u2019s 55-ish last year, 50 this year. Michael Montani : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then if I could also, can you provide the \u2013 an update on the CAF Tier 3 pilot that you all have been doing, what was the penetration there, how was the trending and a related question given that the Tier 3 penetration rate is down, do you feel the need to add additional lenders in that space or take on additional originations in that space? Tom Folliard : Sure. As far as our Tier 3 activity, I would characterize it as steady as she goes. We are comfortable continuing at the same pace that we have been running at, which is roughly 5% of the Tier 3 volume, getting done at the stores. There is really no news there. I think the rationale for doing this program is still good, it still holds true. It\u2019s not about driving additional sales, it\u2019s more about knowledge, risk mitigation and some profitability. As far as looking at our other Tier 3 lenders, we will do that from time to time. We have \u2013 we test lenders when it makes sense. That space though is a little different than the Tier 2 space. I think there is fewer people that are equipped to do it on a national scale. And we are very concerned about making sure we are doing, we are working with partners who are experienced, credible and are going to have a sustainable business and be there. So we are not going to be interested and bringing a new player in that is too risky. Michael Montani : And if I could just, lastly ask the penetration from your website, I was there recently and saw a low-40% range of SUV truck, kind of crossover and van versus sedans being obviously high-50s, when you look at new vehicle SAAR, it\u2019s basically the inverse, with 60% kind of SUV and truck, can you guys give us kind of what that average number would have been for you all during the quarter because just from what I can gather, that could have been a several hundreds of headwind to demand as well, if you assume the same dynamics in the used market as you get on new? Tom Folliard : Are you asking if our mix should be as same as new? Michael Montani : I am just asking for the quarter, what\u2019s the fair way to look at your SUV and truck mix, Tom, broadly speaking as you included crossovers and do you feel...? Tom Folliard : We haven\u2019t looked at it like that, I mean recently, so I couldn\u2019t give that number to you off the top of my head, what I will tell you is we have always been a demand driven inventory model. So what you see on our \u2013 and we are big enough and have enough scale that has inventory turns. We are pretty good at going out and finding it. Occasionally, there are some pockets where we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great deal for our customers so we might be in the light in a particular area. But what you see as an overall percent of sales for the company is largely driven by consumer demand and our inventory turns. On a pace of 600,000-ish cars a year, about half of which we have to buy offsite and half of which we buy through the appraisal line approximately. We are going to buy what customers are buying from us and replenish at that same pace. So I don\u2019t expect us to match up exactly with new car sales. Michael Montani : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Good morning everybody. I wanted to kind of see what you guys were seeing in terms of the ramp-up of mature store base, less than 5 years old, that\u2019s in the comps at this point, maybe it\u2019s about 30% of your store base, how are those maturing and kind of ramping up at this point in terms of their support of same-store sales and leveraging SG&A at this point or are they still kind of lagging in a bit of the drag? Tom Reedy : So I think if you \u2013 first, our leverage in SG&A in any given quarter, that\u2019s going to largely driven by comps in that quarter, particularly for a company that\u2019s in a growth mode like we have been over the last several years and plan to be over the next several. But in terms of the performance of the newer stores, if you take a step back and you look at since we restarted growth in 2011, so fiscal 2011, we have increased our store count by 50%. So we had about 100 stores. We have a little over 150 now and over that same timeframe our net earnings are up by 65% and our EPS is up by 84%. So I mean, I think if we really step back and look at it that way, they are clearly delivering outsized returns and returns that justify continuing to build stores. So we are very pleased with the performance of the stores. They are at or above our financial expectation as a group. And I am glad you asked the question over a longer period of time of 5 years, you go back to 2011 and look at it, again the numbers are store base up 50%, net earnings up 65% and EPS up 84%. Mike Levin : Got it. And it was the first quarter, you guys held gross profit per used units flat on a year-over-year basis in about a year, just wondering what you are seeing there in terms of the gives and takes versus adding some more volume? Tom Reedy : Yes. So I think what we are all \u2013 a couple of dollars, year-over-year, quarter \u2013 last quarter, we were about $39 off and we have said there is a range. We think this is an area where we excel from an inventory management standpoint and feel like that we can continue that range, staying in that range and keep it fairly tight. Now that being said, we will constantly be testing and the looking at trade-offs if you lower the gross profit, what\u2019s the sales that you get back from that, all of the idea of looking also what your total gross profit is if you can get to. So again, we will continue to test but we feel like where we are right now is still the same, it\u2019s sustainable. Mike Levin : Got it. And then just lastly, it was interesting to see that direct expense at CAF move up sequentially in Q1, we have seen it usually seasonally take the tick down from 4Q to Q1, is there anything in particular to read through there and is this kind of the level we should expect going forward? Tom Folliard : There is some stock based impact there as well just like there is in the \u2013 but there is nothing extraordinary going on. Mike Levin : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Irina Hodakovsky : Good morning everyone. We are waiting for Katharine to join us for the parade tomorrow, we think you should let her come visit us\u2026 Katharine Kenny : Thank you. Tom Folliard : She is the one... Irina Hodakovsky : Absolutely and I know we have brought up cabs [ph] with her in the past, so definitely we would love to hear here for the parade, she should join in. We wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Tier 3 a little bit more into that, if you were to put a weight impact on lower Tier 3 traffic versus lower application approval rates, as you mentioned, some of your partners pulling back, how would you weigh that? Tom Folliard : Sure. And let me be a little more clear, it\u2019s not approval rate, we \u2013 if you look at the percent of customers that are up in approval of some kind in the stores that\u2019s well above 90%, what we are seeing is the decline \u2013 a degradation in I guess both quality of the offers, meaning they might be asking for a little bit more money down or they are asking for stipulations and particularly we have seen a step-up in that with one of the lenders there is an increase in asking for proof of income, asking for proof of residence, asking for proof of phone number, things like that. So it\u2019s not really a change in the number of approvals, but the quality of approvals and therefore, the ability the customer to accept or the willingness for the customer to accept it. And as far as the ratio, I think I would say that I can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be super excited about it because it\u2019s not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, two-third and a third to the traffic. And I think there \u2013 I mentioned traffic earlier as it relates to this space. I am not giving too many specifics, what I said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customers. So if you just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell one car than it does to sell one car of a non-Tier 3 customer. So if we are down by 2.5 points in Tier 3 percent of sales, it represents a disproportionately higher percentage of traffic than the sale that it generates. Irina Hodakovsky : That makes sense. Did you see any geographical concentration in lower traffic and sub-prime? Tom Folliard : Yes, we don\u2019t comment on geography. Irina Hodakovsky : Got it. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on the wholesale business. We have seen some softening trends there for the last couple of quarters in terms of wholesale to retail unit ratio as well as profit per unit. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s driving some of that softness and how you expect that business to perform through the balance of the year? Tom Folliard : Yes. Seth, I think if you look out long-term for us, wholesale and retail pretty much grow at about the same pace. And this time, in this quarter, retail grew about 4, wholesale grew about 2. We don\u2019t feel like there is anything really extraordinary to note even the profit, the gross profit margin is off a little bit, but again just like the retail side, that\u2019s within a range and there is really nothing extraordinary to note from that. Seth Basham : Okay. What is your buy ratio? How has that been trending? And do you see more competition to acquire vehicles? Tom Folliard : Yes. The buy rate is still around 30%, which has been a historical high. That\u2019s similar to what it was last quarter, it\u2019s to get that again this quarter. So, I would say that we haven\u2019t seen any indication where customers are choosing to take their vehicles other places and have them purchased by other dealers. Seth Basham : Okay, thank you very much. Tom Folliard : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks. Good morning. Is there a way to size up the exposure on the wholesale side of the business to sub-prime? Bill Nash : I am not sure your question, Rick. Are you saying the... Rick Nelson : Tom, it would seem here the customers that participate in the wholesale auctions, higher mileage, older vehicles would be perhaps even more dependent on sub-prime finance for them to stimulate sales? Tom Folliard : Oh yes, that\u2019s very difficult for us to ascertain with our customer base. I can tell you that we have, we have continued to see very, very strong attendance at our auctions and very, very strong sell-through rates. We have talked about this before and these numbers really haven\u2019t moved very much. We are 98%, 99%ish sell-through rate through the auctions, turning our inventory more than 35 times a year. Our ratio, so our dealer ratio has been very, very strong. I think it\u2019s 1.3 to 1, some of the strongest ratios we have seen. So, we haven\u2019t seen any softening in the demand through our auctions, but you could then relate back to some of the things that we are hearing about in Tier 3. Rick Nelson : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot. Good luck. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Paresh Jain : Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions. The first one on CAF and going back to something you said earlier, you mentioned you were a bit more aggressive in the last 2 years with your CAF offers and that\u2019s leading to some increase in loan loss provisions. And yet when we look at the securitization, the average FICO score there has been impressively been around 700, so just trying to reconcile that if you can provide some color there? Tom Reedy : I think I may not have done a great job explaining it earlier. But in 2013, we began getting more aggressive with the high FICO customers. Our current lowest invest rate is still below 2% today. So, what we saw as an increase in the volume of people at the very highest end of the credit spectrum, which was \u2013 have the effect of potentially bringing down our loss expectations. And so over the last 2 years, we have been trying to manage back towards a range that we have been comfortable with for a long time in the securitization market. So, you could almost think of that as a bit of a barbell effect. You wouldn\u2019t see a dramatic step down in the overall FICO, because we are adding it at the top end and the lower end. Paresh Jain : Understood. Thanks for the color. And then a question on traffic, a superstore, obviously, helps with the conversion rate, but traffic has been an issue for a few quarters now. And at the same time, readers\u2019 report suggests industry retail sales are growing at a healthy clip. So, is that because of these aggregate of websites taking traffic elsewhere? And if so, would you consider having a bigger presence on aggregated websites? Tom Folliard : I am sorry, we would actually consider any website and we have tried several. We have been on all of the big ones. We are on \u2013 we continue to test, I think all of our cars are currently on Car Gurus. So, we have tested all the aggregators and we will use anything that helps us drive incremental sales and delivers a good return. One additional comment on traffic, Bill mentioned some of this earlier is it\u2019s been widely reported that customers are visiting less stores before they buy. So, it only makes sense that customers who show up would be more likely to buy. And as I have said, we think comps will be driven by traffic and conversion. It\u2019s not going to always line up and it doesn\u2019t matter to us which way to get it. So, lot of the efforts we are making around developing a new website given the customer more digital capability are \u2013 those efforts are to make sure that customers get more information, do more research, are more prepared. It\u2019s clear that that\u2019s what they want to do and we want to be in a position to do that for them. So, when they show up, they are more likely to buy. Paresh Jain : Got it. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, everyone. The charge-off, the increase in charge-off, was there any particular concentration in the profile of customers that you saw with these charge-offs or was this more driven by the lower recovery rate since this is the net number? Tom Folliard : Yes, I think this quarter we feel like it was driven by the recovery \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of both, but the recovery rates probably had a little more weight this quarter. And as far as any specifics around customers, we really don\u2019t have anything. Bill Armstrong : Okay. And then with the recovery rate going down, is that simply a function of the Manheim or overall wholesale prices softening up a little bit during the quarter or were there some mix issues as well? Are you getting more sedans versus SUVs in the charge-off mix? Tom Folliard : No, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a by-product of overall pricing in the wholesale market. As you probably know, when we repo cars, we typically sell them off at our auctions and we realize whatever the auction market is delivering at that point in time. And as I said, year-over-year, we are down about 5 points in that wholesale recovery rate. And we never really see much mix impact on the recovery rate that\u2019s always because it\u2019s a pretty big sample. It\u2019s generally going to be a macro trend that\u2019s going to impact the recovery rate. Bill Armstrong : Got it, okay. Thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Good morning. Just wanted to go back I think to an answer on an earlier question, I was trying to ascertain why applications in traffic are falling at the lower end of the credit spectrum. And it sounds like you are really just not sure, is that fair? Tom Folliard : That\u2019s fair. Tom Reedy : Yes. David Whiston : Okay. And then on auction prices, would you say are there any particular areas that are rather still too high in your opinion? Are you anticipating a huge falloff as more vehicles come off lease? Tom Folliard : You are asking about supply now and not recovery rate? David Whiston : Correct. Tom Folliard : We have talked about lease volume in the past. And this past year, leases were 32% of used cars \u2013 of new car sales, roughly. That means you will see that flow come back in the next 3 years, 2 or 3 years. We have seen some increase this year, but I think we will see big increases in lease turn-ins in the next couple of years, not so much this year so far. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Tom Folliard : Thank you. Operator : We do have a follow-up question from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot. Just got back in line. So, my first question relates to stock comp, the number was up big year-on-year. Last year, Q1 had been a pretty big number too. If you look back over time, there hasn\u2019t necessarily been that much seasonality at the stock comp and at the moment in time, the stock has been under some pressure, I was a bit surprised to see the number increase so much over anything you have had in the past, so can you talk about what that related to, please? Tom Folliard : Yes. I mean, what you got to look at, Matt, is the year-over-year change in the stock price. So, I am not sure exactly what happened in the year ago quarter, but the lion\u2019s share of the difference is going to be arising from the difference in the change this year versus the change last year\u2019s first quarter\u2026. Tom Reedy : And the change in the number of people. Tom Folliard : And the change in the number of folks that are getting. Matt Fassler : Is it the year-on-year change in the stock price, because year-on-year kind of today to exactly a year, got stuff down more than 20%. So, is it the magnitude of comp that\u2019s being dumped through stock? Is it \u2013 does it have to do with exercise prices on options? What was that \u2013 what would the number be, what would the driver be to take the dollars up so much? Tom Folliard : It\u2019s largely related to our restricted stock program that the majority of our associates get, because those are going to fluctuate with the market value of the stock. And what you have to look at is not the year-over-year stock price, but the year-over-year change in stock price during the particular quarter. Matt Fassler : Got it. Okay. So, to the extent that you might have started lower and moved higher that would have moved higher. Okay, we can follow-up. It\u2019s a very big number and frankly, I think most of the shortfall versus consensus probably could be traced to that line item. Another question, since I have you, SUVs as a percent of the mix recovered nicely and do you feel like your ability to buy those cars at prices that you like is essentially back or the markets normalizing? Is your ability to navigate those dynamics improved as we have moved into 2016 here? Tom Folliard : Yes. I think to what Tom spoke about earlier, we are going to get the mix in there based off of consumer demand. Are we are able to get that inventory? Yes, we feel like we are able to get it. I still think it\u2019s probably a little bit high. But again, we are not having issues or troubles sourcing it. Matt Fassler : And then finally a question on one financial detail, so you have this new disclosure on the other revenue and gross profit item essentially, the new vehicles plus the service piece is baked in there. So, the year-on-year increase in other gross profit is a bit bigger than what we can track explicitly to the higher warranty revenue and the lower third-party fees. I think you take those out and there is still a few million dollars. Is that all related to presumably lower losses or better grosses on new plus higher service gross profit or is there anything else from the number that would move it higher? Tom Reedy : Matt, I think you hit it on the head. The [indiscernible] are up a little bit better than sales, because we have got some more margin in there and obviously the finance penetration is causing us to be favorable on that. And there is some service favorability in there that makes \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much makes up the difference. Matt Fassler : But nothing out of the ordinary, nothing extraordinary one-time, et cetera? Tom Reedy : Yes, deeper than we expected and we did a little better than we expected. Matt Fassler : Got it. Okay, thank you so much. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Matt. Operator : You have a follow-up question from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Irene, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Irina Hodakovsky : Sorry about that. My question is also around SG&A. That line number was much higher than anyone anticipated. And if you could just maybe tell us how much of that you expect to stay and continue of course the higher store count and how much of that is something specific to the quarter than we can expect to improve going forward? Tom Folliard : I think there was an increase of about $30 million and a large portion of that is attributable to new stores and store growth as a growth company. And then I highlighted in the opening comments, we had about $7 million or $36 per unit on share based comp and then we also had a one-time, where we had some hail damage in some of our Texas stores that was about $18 per unit increase as well. Irina Hodakovsky : Alright. Thank you very much. Tom Folliard : Thanks. Operator : You also have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hey, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to talk a bit if I could about the work you have been doing on the website, I think there was a re-launch in April and what have you seen from that that might be encouraging or incremental to justify kind of the investments in the work that you all have been doing? Tom Folliard : Yes. So, I think it\u2019s a little early on, but what I will tell you is one of the big drivers that we are looking for is what we call lead. So, it\u2019s point to our customer either e-mails us, it sets an appointment, calls us and our goal with the new website is to make sure that we generate more leads, because leads are highly correlated to sales. So, ultimately, you want to drive traffic. Traffic will then drive the leads. We are at the point now where we are trying to figure out how those leads convert in comparison to the old website. We feel good about the leads it\u2019s generating, but again we are trying to understand the conversion of those leads. Michael Montani : And then also can you update us on the thinking around the home delivery testing and then when might we be in a position to get a full transaction done online if that is you can hope? Tom Folliard : Yes. So, the home delivery, we have referenced that in the last call. We did do a test. We have since pulled back on the test. We are looking at how to better operationalize that and we will be coming out with another test later this fall on the home delivery. As far as the full transaction online, that\u2019s something that we will continue to explore. Like I said earlier today, we started looking online financing as a component of that. And again, part of that will also be driven by the consumer demand and need for doing the whole transaction online as well as making sure that we stay within the state restrictions of what can be done online and what can\u2019t be done online. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. It seems like the thing to do today. I did have a question regarding buyback expectations. I thought the general plan was to do a pretty steady run-rate quarter-after-quarter, but obviously the buyback was a little bit softer than I think the pattern we have seen recently. What\u2019s the general idea moving forward? Is it going to be more of an opportunistic pattern or it should be a relatively steady run-rate from what we just saw in 1Q? Tom Folliard : Yes, Scot. I think, it\u2019s \u2013 our goal as we have talked about before is to be kind of a steady player in there, but we are going to have some latitude around how aggressive we are based on where the stock price is in our view evaluation. As we talked about, we are targeting a certain capital structure that debt to capital, excluding the non-recourse stuff and account receivables of 35% to 45%. A quarter or so ago, we got up to the bottom end of that range. So, it would be natural to see a little bit of a tapering off as we have moved from a mode of moving to a newer capital structure, a more leveraged capital structure to one of maintaining that capital structure. That said, with the amount of cash that we have generated and becoming all things staying equal, the amount of cash we generate, the amount of growth we are doing, we would expect to continue to need to repurchase shares and add debt into the capital structure to maintain that. So, I would say, our expectation is to be in the market on a pretty consistent basis going forward, but we do have some parameters around our program that allow us to be more or less aggressive depending on market conditions. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. So, the change in pace is more a function of kind of getting to that lower end of the cap structure rather than your assessment of the value of the stocks, I thought the other thing you just said, Tom, was regarding being opportunistic? Tom Folliard : Yes, going from moving toward the capital structure to maintaining it. So, that would have a natural change of pace. But as I said, we are \u2013 I think we ended the quarter a little bit below this quarter. So, we have got that latitude of some 10 points that we will be working with them. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Tom Folliard : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Your next follow-up comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Hey, guys. Thanks again. Just wanted to kind of get your feelings around the recovery rates that have been down on auto IBS across the market and for you guys this quarter. Is that playing a role in some of the tightening standards that you are seeing? How do you think that\u2019s kind of going to progress going forward in terms of credit availability and cost of borrowing for your securitizations? Tom Folliard : I guess, I would point to \u2013 we have been doing securitization, independent securitizations for over 13 years now and we have been able to manage through a lot of different market conditions, including recovery rates that are lower than what they are today. That said the structure and the enhancement in the deal might need to be modified if loss, if the perceived losses in the rating agency size change. What that usually means though is the change in the over-collateralization that gets built into the deals and builds over time, meaning we give money back a little bit slower. But in general, we have been \u2013 we will be able to maintain a pretty solid program through a lot of different environments. As far as our partner lenders, have you asked them about how they view that in their tightening, but again, they \u2013 I think, probably more of the impact is what they are experiencing in their portfolio than the overall wholesale market. Mike Levin : Got it. And if I remember correctly, a couple of years ago, when Santander did some pulling back, you guys added some lenders to the platform. Are you considering that now as well? Tom Folliard : Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we would \u2013 we will test partners to the extent it makes sense for us. But as I also said, in this space, I think we need to be much more careful about who we are doing business with and make sure that we have established partners that can be reliable source of financing for our customers over a longer period of time. I know it\u2019s been talked to a lot of players out there that are behaving aggressively. Santander has talked about that as well and that they are willing to let some of them get the business. But we are very focused on \u2013 in the right place for our customers and as I said, we will test as it is appropriate, but not many people have the national scale that we would need. Mike Levin : Understood. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to follow-up on your CapEx guidance plan, I think last quarter, you took it up a little bit for the year, can you kind of explain that again, kind of how you said playing out the course of the year and what exactly that relates to? Tom Folliard : Yes. I think and you saw a step-up a bit versus recent years, a lot of that is due to timing of what we expect land acquisitions to do over the next year. I really wouldn\u2019t read into it too much as far as the existing stores or anything. We are working on a pipeline of many, many different locations, the next 3 years to 4 years of growth and our ability to acquire land is different in every situation. And I think as we look forward this year, we just saw a little bit heavier land acquisition than we have done in the past. And there is a lot of timing in there too as well, so if you look at the tail end of this year, there will be significant investment in the openings that are coming the following year. So that\u2019s just our best guess that timing over the next 12 months. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. Does that give you flexibility to uptake your store opening plan or is that just nothing read into there? Tom Folliard : No, nothing to read into there, we have announced what our projections are and we are sticking to them. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. And then one follow-up, just want to get your overall thoughts in the whole awfully supply that\u2019s surging, I mean you are already sourcing about 77% of your units 0.4, which was really impressive, is there any reason to think that the added off-lease supply would actually accelerate that mix or is it really just instead of sourcing trade-ins, you are outsourcing off-lease supply like how do you think about that? Tom Folliard : Yes. I kind of think they are unrelated we are going to drive \u2013 try to drive as much as we can through our own appraisal lane. I think when the off-lease supply starts to come back, like Tom said earlier, we haven\u2019t seen a big off-lease supply coming back into the auction houses, but certainly when it does come back in, we will be in a position to buy them because we turn our inventory so quickly. If there are good deals we will be able to realize those good deals for our customers. So we kind of think about them separately, appraisal lane versus off-site. Tom Reedy : But historically, when there has been a big lease volume and it comes back at the sale, we are usually in a pretty good position to take advantage of it. And just on a side note, it does organize the cars a lot better at the auction. Chris Bottiglieri : And how does the organization help, can you maybe just walk through that, you can play in better or? Tom Reedy : Sure. In any given year, there is going to be \u2013 people are getting out of their car let\u2019s say, every 3 years, 4 years, 5 years. Well, when it\u2019s leasing, it\u2019s pretty programmed that they are going to get out at a certain time. And a lot of those cars go back through whoever the lessor was. And then those lessors, then run big long lanes at the auction as opposed to those same cars, which might end up at the auction otherwise are spread out. And GMAC could be running 1,000 cars in a row. Chris Bottiglieri : Interesting. Okay cool. Thank you very much for the commentary. I appreciate that. Tom Reedy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to the presenters for any closing remarks. Tom Folliard : Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And of course, I want to thank all of our associates for all they do everyday to make CarMax such a great success.

My name is Victoria and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, Victoria and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today is Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.

Before I turn the call over to Bill, I hope you will all remember to ask only one question and a follow up before getting back in the queue. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine, and good morning everyone. First, I want to take a moment just to thank Tom Folliard for his significant contributions to CarMax over the last 23 years. We are very fortunate that he is still involved and will be Chairman of our Board and I am looking forward to continuing to work with him. So, Tom, if you are listening, which I am sure you are since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time of the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax. Over these past few months I have spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great associates and I am committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I am also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future. More than 20 years ago CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we are focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We are in a unique position to leverage our core strength which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience. We have launched a new Web site. We are testing new online shopping capabilities and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide. Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We are committed to our national expansion and will open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year. Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I will conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives. Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3% and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%. When it comes to our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at $2,160 remained consistent with $2,166 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year we had one less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays. Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year's wholesale vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison. Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, zero to four year old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during a quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a five dollar increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter. The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the Board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree even though he is somewhat younger but he far exceeded the service requirement having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF's net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our tier 2 lenders performance based on what we see on their conversion of customers to sale, continued to be strong they were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower end credit applications as well. In addition to the slower volume, tier 3 sales continued to be affected by credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% for the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced starting in the middle of Q1 of this year. CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion. The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables, and additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we have learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations, given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% in the last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin however has been at about 5.9% for three consecutive quarters. Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels which as we have discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy, as well as the store lease extensions that we have previously discussed in our filings. During the second quarter we took down the remaining $200 million of a private debt deal we closed in Q1 and we repurchased $2.4 million shares for $126 million. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks. Tom. During the second quarter we opened three stores. El Paso, Texas, and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were in new markets for us. We also opened a third store in Boston. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idaho, another new market for us. During the third quarter, we expect to open five more stores. Four will be in current markets including Philadelphia, Orlando and two in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us. Last quarter I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I would like to give you an update on those efforts. I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive Web site. The new Web site combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state of the art technology platform which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience. This is the first full quarter with the new Web site in place and we are pleased with the performance so far. We have seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts. With our new site, we have to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the Web site to store and finally to a sale. Second, we have been testing an online financing capability to help our customers to get pre-qualified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. They can get pre-qualified for financing from any computer or mobile device and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We have expanded the pilot to 13 stores and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months and we will provide with you an update next quarter. Lastly, we have previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store. We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like. CarMax's national footprint, unparalleled inventory and brand strength position us to continue to lead the industry. Now I will open it up for questions. Victoria? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Bill, welcome to the CEO role. Bill Nash : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So I have a couple of questions, and I'll squish them together here. First off, with respect to used car unit comps, clearly there was a lot of estimate for, I guess a lot of noise with regard to forecast for the quarter. As I look at the results today, call it the 3% used car unit comp, was quite good in the sense that it suggested an acceleration from first quarter levels. So the question I have there is, as you look at the dynamic behind that, can you help us identify what may have changed in the environment for CarMax here in Q2 versus Q1 to help to facilitate that acceleration in used car unit comps? And then I'll do my follow-up. Bill Nash : Yes. So, first of all, Brian, we are encouraged by the overall comps of the little over 3%. We are equally encouraged that we got that even with the headwind that we faced in the tier 3 space. So, again, if you looked at just the non-core -- I am sorry, the non-tier 3 sales, it was really at 8%. So we feel good about that. And I think really what you are seeing is the culmination of a bunch of different initiatives and better execution at the store level. I can't pinpoint it to necessarily one thing that\u2019s driving comps this quarter over last quarter. I think it's the culmination of some of the strategic initiatives that we have been talking about and I think also just better execution at the store level. Brian Nagel : So on that, is the supply situation, I know we talk a lot about supply over the last several quarters now, but are you seeing some relief on the supply side, is that positive? Bill Nash : Yes, I think on the supply side I think the expectations were that was going to be coming back more in full force at this point and continue on later into next year and in the year after. We really haven't seen a big, huge increase in the supply of late model cars. I think there is some coming out there but we haven't seen the big increase that I think was originally expected and we think it will come, our external partners being the auctions think they will come later this year into next year and even the year after. Brian Nagel : Okay. And then my follow up on the -- with respect to the credit business. The loan loss provision there, just help us understand that. I get it, they're still very small numbers but the 1.4% here in the second quarter was up modestly year-on-year and sequentially. How should we think about that increase? Is it more one time in nature? Is there something happening in the business? Bill Nash : What I can say, Brian, is that it incorporates everything we have learned about the portfolio to date. We can't speak to how things are going to migrate in the future but I think it's important to point out that we have been in an environment of very favorable, not just we but the overall credit markets in general, have been in a very favorable loss environment for the last few years, the last couple of years at least. And it's not hugely surprising to see things starting to migrate a little bit differently. That said, all we can put into -- all we put into our provision is what we learned to date. We are not making any prognostications about the future and continued movement and obviously we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies if it merits that. I mean it -- as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter sequentially it's not that big of an uptick. If you look year-over-year, it's a pretty significant jump about, but about half of that jump we would have expected based on the fact that the portfolio has grown 12% and the experience that we had in Q1, we incorporated into our provision for this quarter. So there was some unexpected unfavorable experience but much of the change in the provision shouldn\u2019t be too unexpected even though it was a pretty big step up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I guess I'm going to ask two questions but really quickly. The subprime degradation you're seeing, Tom, can you talk about whether that's more on the applications or the approval side? If you're seeing a little bit of both and whether there's any stabilization occurring there? Tom Reedy : Sure. Sure. Yes, I think mentioned -- we are seeing it on both sides, right. If you kind of looked at our degradation year-over-year, we would estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume and the remaining 60% is really due to a change in behavior of our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who has been in the press about and talking about how they are pulling back in different spaces, we saw change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn\u2019t really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1, but since May we have seen stable performance in the tier three space that doesn\u2019t, I am not speaking to the future, but we\u2019ve seen four months of stability and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes. As far as the change, it's more of the same that we have talked about in the past as we have seen changes in lender behavior. Our global approval rate is still well above 90% but the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they are asking for more down or if they are asking for stipulations like proof of income etcetera. And so that\u2019s the nature of the tightening that we have seen. Sharon Zackfia : I guess as a follow up to that. Does this in any way kind of change your attitude towards maybe expanding the CAF test in subprime or, I know you're always testing other lenders. Is there anything you can do there to augment what's happening with Santander? Tom Reedy : I think, as you pointed out, we are always looking at testing other lenders, we have got a test running right now but it's not big enough to talk about. The interesting thing about this space is there is very few national players, it's like much more a regional space in the financing world. So we can test additional lenders. As far as CarMax Auto Finance, we are comfortable with our level of activity where it is. I mean we are not -- Santander is not pulling back because they are delighted with what they are seeing in that portfolio. And when we think about that space, there is more to it than just the profit, there is the impact on our brand. There is the impact on our reputation with customers and in this current environment I think we are happier being thought of as a prime lender that has some activity in the tier 3 space. We are learning from it. We are learning how to originate. We are learning how to service. We are leaning how to perform and we are building a track record in that space. But we haven't determined that. Now is the time to go forward with anything greater. And if you remember, when we first rolled this out a couple of years ago, we have said specifically that we were not interested in this space in order to augment sales at CarMax. It was more of a learning and potential profit play and that we could be one of several players in this space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : You guys did talk about seeing some slower traffic trends from lower credit quality customers last quarter as well. With more time to analyze your data and any kind of surveys you're doing, do you have any more clarity on what may be driving that? I'm trying to figure out, are people kind of disqualifying themselves from even walking in because they know they're going to be declined credit or is this just fewer footsteps coming from a certain portion of the consumer base? Tom Reedy : Yes. It's difficult to pry all that data apart, Scot. So unfortunately I think we are not going to have a real satisfying answer for you on that. We can really only comment on what we have seen in our stores. One thing we do believe is there is some co-relation between the quality of offer that we are providing in the stores and the application volume because there is word of mouth in the customer space. The quality of offers is currently down year-over-year and has declined over the last several quarters. Scot Ciccarelli : When you say quality of offer, you're talking about terms? Tom Reedy : I am talking about the terms, not whether they are approved or not but whether they are approved and need another $1000 down or if there is something else. So what we have observed in the stores is a reduction in those applications, call it the below $600 FICO level and continued increases in the volume of applications on the high end. Now I can't speak to what other people are experiencing but we have seen some communications from other retailers that this particular segment of customers is a bit challenged today. So to the extent that might plan the things that\u2019s there. But when you ask about that and what you might do about it, is we think about hypothesis where we could be driving this it's not apparent to us that there is a course of change in our action in this segment that would be appropriate. Remember, we have always talked about this business as incremental and we already invest $1000 per car into this channel in order to realize half, a third to half of the profit of a tier two or a CAF deal. So we could speculate that, would our lenders like to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive. I am sure they would say they would try. But I don\u2019t think we are interested in increasing the, or decreasing our margin any further on this space and we are certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our tier 3 partners. That\u2019s just not good business for us. I think the investments Bill discussed in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us and looking at the business absent the effects of the tier 3 space, we are pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer-term growing off the base of 45% CAF and 10% tier 3, is a much more profitable equation than when we were seeing tier 3 in your 20% a couple of years ago. So I don\u2019t know what it makes of the overall environment but like I said, I don\u2019t think there is any action or course we would change to try to address the phenomena we are seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : I've got one question and one follow up, if you'll let me. We talk about traffic and some of the traffic declines. We haven't spoken a lot about the quality of traffic, not in terms of creditworthiness but in terms of how much research consumers have done and one would think that the attachment rate of heavy web research with the transactions growing substantially. So, is traffic as relevant of a metric for you? That could be a function of why, that could be why your conversion is rising the way it is. So should we even be looking at traffic at this moment in time? I realize it's a good legacy metric, but it doesn't seem to be aligning with your comps and perhaps that's the reason why. Bill Nash : No. Matt, I think that\u2019s a good point. I think we know that nine out of ten of our customers that are buying from us start their shopping experience online. And they are coming in with better research already having been done. I think for us store traffic is still important and to your point, it has been kind of a legacy metric for us but I think equally important is we need to be looking at web traffic, we need to be looking at leads. Leads are highly, in the past they have been highly co-related to sales. So I think you have to step back and take more of a holistic picture and not just look at traffic. Because I do think part of the reason conversion is up, I think it's from execution, but I also think it's partly because people are coming in more informed and knowing what they want. Matthew Fassler : My follow up relates to cut and stop sale. All independent used car retailers are operating, I believe, with less restriction than franchise dealers, at least when it relates to the brands associated with, that those dealers typically sell. Are you getting a sense that this is taking your share higher? Are more customers coming to you because they can't get access to the cars they want at the franchise dealers? Bill Nash : No. I mean that\u2019s really a hard thing to come out and I would say we believe that we are not necessarily getting some big benefit from that. We are real proud of the transparency that we have when it comes to recalls. We have led the industry. If you shop online, you will see, you will get the ability to check them into Web site to see if there is any open recalls. When you come in the stores, you can't buy a car without working through the sales consultant to understand, are there any open recalls on these vehicles and if they are signing off on those recalls. So we feel good about that. And to your point, there are lots of other dealers out there selling vehicles with open recalls. I just think that we do it in the most transparent way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Bill, you mentioned that CarMax covers about 65% of the addressable U.S. market today. But with your opportunity to invest in some of your digital initiatives, could the pace of investment in those bricks and mortar stores slow in some of the out years? Bill Nash : So, Craig, what we said and we will probably update this later on, but we are still committed to the national expansion. We have got 13 to 16 stores planned next year. Certainly I think as we go forward, we will look at the design of the stores and the design of the prototypes may change but at this point we are still committed to building brick and mortar facilities. Craig Kennison : And just as a follow up. How many states will allow you to use home delivery as part of that new service you've piloted? Bill Nash : Yes. I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head, Craig. I would have to get back to you on that. With your earlier question, the other thing I would just reiterate is we think that the advantage for us will be, as we look forward it's going to be a combination of having that store presence but then also being able to do the transactions online and being able to combine those two. And I think to be ultimately successful, or as successful as I think we can be, we need to do both of those really well. Well, that\u2019s why we are still committed to building out facilities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on SG&A because it seemed like a pretty good performance in the quarter. I mean when we back out the increase in stock comp, there really wasn't much deleveraging and we're looking at a store base that's almost 11% greater year-over-year. We're looking at investment in online opportunities and all your new efforts, yet we're not seeing a deleveraging in SG&A. So just curious, as we think about all the buckets of potential increases in deleveraging that we usually would expect, how are they playing out in SG&A and how do you think that should work going forward because it really is a very impressive performance. There really was no SG&A deleverage and traditionally we would look for like a 7% to 8% increase in same store sales to see this kind of performance and you put up a good number, 3.1%, but I mean it's not what we would have expected. It was a very good performance. Is there anything going on here in thrifting in certain areas or investment that might not be as great as we're thinking? Tom Reedy : John, this is Tom. One think I would point out is something we called that in the release, is that there is some other favorable things going on with regard to incentive comp in this quarter that were larger than what we have seen in prior quarters. And it's relatively in line, I mean that stock-based comp was up quite a bit. But if you look at that and then the full year adjustment, they're of similar magnitude. So I wouldn't read into this that we're doing a better job with SG&A than we had been in the past. We're investing comp and benefits. If you look at those two things, absent those two things, is in line with that, the 11% you see on the table in the graph. Store occupancy is up in line with our growth of stores. So there's nothing really to talk about there. Advertising looks light relative to last year, but that's because last year we were in the midst of creating a new ad campaign that rolled out in Q3. So, both Q2 and Q3 last year were heavy ad spend. Bill Nash : And John, the only thing I'd add to that, I mean we still feel like we can leverage at the mid-single digit comps and to Tom Reedy's point, we're continuing to invest in some of the technologies, in the digital experiences that I talked about earlier. Now that being said, we have an SG&A on a yearly basis over $1 billion and we're certainly focused on continuing to look at opportunities and continuing to do things better to continue to leverage more in the future. John Murphy : So maybe to put a finer point on it, you would say that roughly something in the 5% to 7.5% range on same store sales comps would be enough to create some small leverage on SG&A, given all the efforts that are going on right now? Bill Nash : I think that's fair. I... Tom Reedy : We see some leverage at mid-single digit. 7% is pretty big. Once you start getting above that fulcrum of leverage, it gets pretty powerful. So I would say 7%, we feel pretty good. John Murphy : Okay. So, 5% plus or minus is breakeven and as we get above that there's potential for some really good operating leverage to kick in? Tom Reedy : And I'd just use that as a rule of thumb. We haven't dusted that off. John Murphy : That's incredibly helpful. Just one quick follow-up. We see rates ratchet up on the cost side on CAF. You guys increased the cost to the consumer, I think, 20 bps. What is your comfort level in passing through the cost increase through to the customer so we don't see spreads sort of on a continuous basis, compress? Tom Reedy : Yes. I think we're constantly testing at CAF, both up and down, depending on what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I think I've said this before on calls, the performance of the finance business is going to be somewhat market driven. We have to be an attractive alternative for our customers in financing or else we'd be turning people off to CarMax. So, if competition is aggressive and willing to accept a slightly lower spread than they are currently, we will have to adjust our offers over time to meet that competition and make sure that we're still relevant to the customer. That said, if you look at the last eight or nine securitization deals, the spread has been pretty consistent in the mid-5s. And that's not out of line with what we've seen in higher interest rate environment. So like I said, we've been in higher interest rate environments before where cost of funds have been higher, where we've been able to achieve the spreads we are today. What's really the wild card is competition and how aggressive they get. And like I said, we'll have to be a market player, and that's just part of being in the finance business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Two questions. One is, there have been a few anecdotal reports, I think Experian and a few others, talking about a trend of consumers shifting from the new market to the used market, just given the inflation that's occurred in new car pricing. And I was wondering if this is something that you're observing and whether that you feel is a trend that could be quite meaningful? Obviously, seeing 8% comps in the prime side of things might support that. Bill Nash : Yes. I have not heard that. I hope it's the case but I think part of what's helping is the prices of wholesale vehicles have gone down. Our ASP went down slightly. I think it's a factor of -- part of it's a shift from the zero to four to a little bit older vehicle for us. Part of it is the cheaper acquisition price as well, with a little offset in the fact that our large SUVs as a percent of mix are a little bit higher, a couple of points higher than they were a year ago. But I have not heard what you're referencing. Rod Lache : Okay. Thanks. And just, I guess, a follow-up on CAF. It's been a relatively modest increase in provisions but just in terms of the trends that you're observing, is the decline mostly a function of frequency or is it severity as you're seeing some modest declines in used car prices? Bill Nash : I think what we observed is a little bit of both. Last quarter it was a little bit more severity. So, if you look at kind of recovery rate year over year, it was more impactful last quarter. But at the end of the day, we've just got to keep an eye on both of them and we watch what's happening in the portfolio and we can adjust as we go. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : I wanted to ask first, if I could, can you just give an update on SUV and truck penetration this quarter versus a year ago? And then just talk about your ability to source between those buckets and toggle between them as prices soften a little bit. Bill Nash : Yes. So SUVs for us was up about 2 points. I think it was 25% of our mix, which is about 2 points higher than a year ago. And again, we're out in the market every week, every day, buying cars, and if we feel like they're at a good price, we're certainly going to buy them if that's what the customers are demanding. We want to make sure it's a good price. Again, we sell what the consumer demand is on our lot. So as prices shift, that's pretty much standard operating procedure for us. We're able to go in and take advantage of those offers. Michael Montani : If I could just follow up on some of the online initiatives that you have, one question there is what you're seeing in particular if you can share, Bill, around the rollout of home delivery that's encouraging and making you expand it? And then the second question was, when you look at search engine optimization, if I do a Google search for used cars, you all are coming up on page four. And it just doesn't make sense to me. So I guess the question is, what kind of priority do you assign to search engine optimization and moving up that non-paid list on Google? Bill Nash : Right. So on the home delivery, if you remember, we did a very limited test back in February and the goal of that test was really to see, does this resonate with our customers. And we felt like there is enough interest at the customer level that we decided to, okay, let's look at this, try to operationalize a little bit better and we had talked about coming back with a second test. It's really too early to give you any results because we just started the second test, just in the last couple weeks. And, again, the plan for this test is to understand, have we been able to operationalize it better, can we operationalize it even more. And then, really important to that also, is that we want to make sure that the experience meets our high standards of great customer service that we have in the stores. So that's really what we're trying to understand with this piece. It's too early to really talk about any type of results. On the search engine optimization, obviously a big part of the web redesign is making sure that when customers search for us, that we come up organically. That's the best thing. When you don't have to pay for a lead and you just automatically come up on the first page. And what I can tell you, if I look at over a year ago, about a year ago if you searched for us in some generic terms we didn't show up on the first page. We were in some cases several pages below the first page. And if you search for something, you typically don't go many pages past the first page. I'm pleased to tell you that we've made great strides. And when you type in key words now, we're on that first page and our goal is to continue to climb that first page. So, we're encouraged by the results and the progress that we've made since we've been working on it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Irina Hodakovsky : This is actually Irina Hodakovsky on for Brett Hoselton. How are you? Most of the questions have been asked. I do want to ask a basic question on the share buyback. In your release you stated you have $1.89 billion remaining open. Last quarter your release stated $1.27 billion. Has there been an increase and what should we expect going forward? Tom Reedy : Yes, I think, our board authorized a $750 million increase last quarter and they also took off the time limitations on the program. So I think the message there is it's become a part of what we do. As far as on a go forward basis, we talked about having a target capital structure in the adjusted debt to capital range of 35% to 45%. Both last quarter and this quarter we're scratching up on the bottom end of that. And as I said last quarter, I think you can look to be more in a maintenance mode rather than a shifting the capital structure mode on a go forward basis. That said, with the cash flow nature of the business as it stands today, we'll continue to generate significant cash and we would expect to continue to buy back stock and continue to add debt to maintain those targets. And as we've said before, we try to do a little bit of an enlightened averaging in. So I wouldn't read into volume in any given quarter. It may be dictated by our view on valuation versus where things are. Irina Hodakovsky : What is the new updated expiration date on the program? Tom Reedy : As I said, they eliminated the expiration feature of the program. Irina Hodakovsky : Oh, eliminated, I'm sorry. I didn't hear that correctly. Tom Reedy : It's part of what we do now and we expect to be in the market maintaining the capital structure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Albertine with Consumer Edge. Jamie Albertine : I just wanted to understand if there were any changes from an inventory management perspective as it relates to when a vehicle's VIN would go in and out of your system as it's perceived on the web. Whether it's related to transfers across stores or if it's always a sale, or if it has something to do with recalls. Just wanted to get some underpinnings as to what may be driving the shifts in inventory we might be seeing from a web [indiscernible] perspective intra-quarter. Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. We haven't changed any of our practices or processes or behaviors. So I really can't speak to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : I have a question about wholesale operation. The participants in those auctions, the independent used car lots, how dependent on subprime finance do you think those independents are? Bill Nash : Yes, Rick, I think they're probably more dependent than a franchise dealer, but some of them finance themselves. It's really hard to say. Tom Reedy : This is Tom. One thing I'd point out also, and I can't speak for the practice at all of those customers, but they do usually as a matter of course, have the ability to change the price that they charge the customer. So to the extent it's getting more challenging in subprime and their vendors may be asking for more money up front, they have more flexibility to do it than we would in our fixed price system. So the answer is, we don't know and I think it's across the board but there are some levers that they may pull that we certainly wouldn't. Bill Nash : And I think that phenomenon exists even with other franchise dealers. Rick Nelson : Okay. Thank you for that. Is all the decline in the tier 3 at all due to the tier 2 dipping into that tier 3 bucket? I know you've discussed that in the past. Tom Reedy : I think in past quarters we've observed that. Tier 2 is clearly, from the data we look at, clearly behaving more aggressively, which is great for us, than they were a year ago, and when we look at conversion of the applications that they're seeing. So that would de facto be another thing that impacts the volume that tier 3 is seeing. But as I mentioned, tier 2 is down a little bit as well, just because of the overall mix shift. So, while they're behaving more aggressively and they're doing a great job for us and we're happy with the partners we have in that space, less is filtering down to them because more of it is getting caught by the high end credit and CAF. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is a little bit more broader on the wholesale business. With wholesale gross profit down 10% year-over-year, obviously you had a calendar shift. But are there any other things you can point to which led to that decline and how do you think it's going to perform going forward? Tom Reedy : Yes. So if you look at the wholesale margin GPU, I called out earlier in my remarks, it's a very tough comparison. When I say tough comparison, last year's second quarter was the highest GPU for wholesale we've ever experienced as an organization, so -- I'm sorry, in the second quarter. So, it was a very tough comparison. I think what you're seeing is the amount that we're at now is more representative of a typical second quarter. The other thing that I would point out is, last year's second quarter from a depreciation or appreciation standpoint, it was really stable. This year it was a depreciating market and you know we aren't proactive, we're more reactive and we move as the market moves. We don't speculate. So I think it's a combined factor of tough comparison and also a different type of market this second quarter, which really is more representative of what we would typically see in the second quarter versus last year. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up question, Bill. The company has had a practice of trying to maintain gross profit per unit pretty flattish for the last five years or so. How do you think about the balancing of comps versus GPU going forward? Bill Nash : Yes. I've been involved with the organization for a long time and we've held that $2,100 to $2,200 pretty consistent for multiple quarters. Like we've talked about in the past, we're always willing and we're always trying, if you give up a little bit of margin, do you make it up more in sales, so that your total GPU or total gross profit goes up. We'll continue to test. But I also feel good about the fact that we're able to maintain that GPU. And as I think about levers to pull, if we want to make sure our price stays competitive, it's not just GPU, it's also acquisition price and it's also about the dollars that you put into a vehicle to get it to our quality standards. So again, I think our focus is going to be on acquisition price, it will be on the reconditioning, because again we're more focused on the spread between what we buy a car and what a customer ultimately pays for it. And we think that we feel good about where the margin is right now. We'll continue to test, obviously, but we're really focused on acquisition cost and the amount that we put into it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : So SUV and truck mix was up pretty considerably. That should have driven ASPs higher. I'm not sure what you said about late model vehicles, the zero to fours, if those increased or not at the penetration level. I guess taking that together, your ASPs were actually down year-over-year. So, do we read into that, that you took a price investment this quarter? That being said, you held your GPU per unit even though your wholesale acquisition cost per unit seemed to increase. I'm just trying to triangulate all of that. Like what's the takeaway from all of that? Tom Reedy : Yes. Chris, earlier I mentioned, while our mix was up slightly in the large SUVs, and you're right, that would drive the average ASP up a little bit. But we more than offset that with the fact that we had a mix shift. We didn't sell as many zero to four as we did last year, zero to four year old cars. This year we sold a few percentage points more in the older vehicles and those are typically less expensive. And the other thing that I would point out, that I spoke about earlier was we saw a cheaper acquisition price and that's reflective of what's going on or what went on in the market during the second quarter. So, it's really a combination of those three factors to get us down to a lower ASP. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. That makes sense. And then on tier 2, I'm not sure if you guys disclosed this historically, but what percentage of those loans would you say are subprime by FICO standards, like less than 620? I think you called [intentional] [ph] a slight pullback there. Bill Nash : A majority of them. Chris Bottiglieri : Majority of tier 2. Bill Nash : Yes. I think, like I said before, I think subprime can be in the eye of the beholder. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, I agree. Bill Nash : CAF, a wide spectrum of folks and FICO score is not the only indicator that lenders use to determine creditworthiness and whether they're going to advance. So some of what CAF does falls into that lower end. A good amount of tier 2 falls into that lower end and clearly all of tier 3, unless there is something really funny about the deal, fall into that lower end of the FICO. So as I said, tier 2s, their volume has been impacted but their behavior we're very happy with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King. Bill Armstrong : You took out a new $100 million warehouse facility for CAF tier 3 financing. Does this portend, perhaps, an appetite with CAF for more tier 3 lending or should we not really read anything into this? Tom Reedy : I guess the short answer is, I would not read anything into this. As I discussed a little bit earlier, we are comfortable with our current level of activity and have no intentions at this time to change that. That said, like we want to learn about the space. We think it's good to build a track record on the financing side and I would rather use that capital to buy back stock and build new stores than fund the subprime initiative. So it makes sense, even though it's a small amount, it makes sense to take out debt against it because we can use third party capital. Bill Armstrong : Got it. And would you be -- you wouldn't be securitizing this, you would just keep these loans in the warehouse facility and work through it like that? Tom Reedy : Well, the warehouse legally is a securitization. So it's a non-recourse facility just like the warehouse for the core business but I think at this point we're comfortable with what we're doing. To the extent it ever got bigger, then we'd start contemplating permanent financing vehicles but we're not anywhere near that at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Paresh Jain : Just a question on superstores. When you look at some of your peers, particularly on the franchise front, they're increasingly moving to a smaller store format. Can you remind us again as to what the relative advantages of a superstore are in today's environment? Bill Nash : Well, Paresh, what I would tell you is, I actually haven't heard the superstore name in a long time. We used to have what we called superstores. The mix of stores today are dramatically different than they were even 10, 15 years ago. And when I look at our stores today, we have small format stores which has been introduced in the last five years. We also have satellite stores that don't have production. We have satellite stores with production. We have bigger production stores and then typical size CarMax stores. So, I think what you've seen over time with us is that we've shifted our prototypes and our models depending on the market that we're going in and we don't open up just one standard store size. Tom Reedy : I think I'd add to that is, when we go into a market, no matter what kind, we're taking into account what our expectations are for sales volume in that location, which means how much inventory we need and also whether there's going to need to be an auction production. It's a bigger puzzle and it might involve various locations, and we try to flex the size of the space to the need that we view is in that particular market. As Bill said, we've got a number of smaller prototypes now than we did several years ago. Paresh Jain : Understood. And just a follow-up on home delivery. When you look at some of the new entrants in this space, customer acquisition costs could be significantly higher, perhaps more than double the $200 to $250 range that you guys might be seeing. Is that something you'd be comfortable with to gain traction for that business or take it up a little bit higher than what your current range is? Bill Nash : Yes. That's one of the reasons why we're testing it. We want to make sure that it resonates. We're talking about probably a very small subset of CarMax customers that would take advantage of this. We still think about how complicated the used car transaction is and how it needs human intervention, which we do a phenomenal job in our stores. Again, it's a test for us and we'll give you more updates in the future. Tom Reedy : It's too early to talk about whether it would be worth the additional cost because we need to scope what those additional costs would be and vet that out more significantly, and also determine how much incrementality there would be in that particular segment. We think it's much too early to tell. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : You touched on this a little bit earlier. I just still wasn't clear. Any idea why your zero to four year old mix fell despite there being less traffic from the lower credit quality customers? Is there a bit of a supply issue there? Bill Nash : No, there is not a supply issue. Again, we're meeting the demands of our customers and if our customers are looking for more older vehicles that are less expensive, then we're going to meet that need. So, it's more driven off of the customer need than any supply issue. David Whiston : Okay. Thanks. And, Bill, now that you've had some time to travel around the store base a bit, is there anything you want to change or improve about the operations or the company as a whole? Bill Nash : No. Like I said earlier, I'm really excited and proud of what our associates do on a daily basis. Their job is not an easy job. And when I go out to the store, I see improvements. I see dedication to the company. I see everybody looking to figure out, how can we execute better and do our jobs better and provide a better customer experience to our customers? So, no, I think it's going great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks for having me back for a couple of follow-ups. The other overhead line within SG&A was up meaningfully. Is that technology investment or is something else showing up in that line item? Tom Reedy : The bulk of that, you've hit it right on the head, the bulk of it is investment in technology and digital. Matthew Fassler : Is that likely to persist directionally? Tom Reedy : Yes, we're going to continue to invest in that. And to my point earlier, we spend over $1 billion. So our job is to make sure that we refocus some of that money, so it's not all incremental. But, yes, we will continue to invest in this. Matthew Fassler : And then, secondly, you've spoken a bit about zero to four and the age of cars that you're selling. I want to try to tie that in to the sources of used cars coming back onto the market. Presumably with the SAAR stabilizing or even slowing somewhat, transactions emanating from consumers buying new cars are flattening out or moderating but the institutional supply of cars coming off lease, I think, continues to grow. Are more of the cars that are hitting the market in that zero to four coming through auction rather than through trade in the marketplace at large? And is that one of the factors that, given your desire to maintain self sufficiency at a fairly high rate, is that one of the factors that could be impacting what you're selling? And, if so, does that impact profitability at all? It doesn't seem to be doing so, yes, but just to play that out. Bill Nash : No, I don't think there's any big meaningful difference that we've seen through the appraisaling or through the auctions as it relates to zero to four. I do think we're a little surprised we haven't seen more of it funnel back. But, again, to my point earlier, we think that that's coming and it will be over multiple years. It certainly won't come back all at one time. And when we talk to our auction partners they agree that there's probably a lot that will be coming back next year and even the year after. Operator : That's our last question. I'd like to turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Victoria. In closing, again, I just want to thank all of our associates nationwide. They're doing an outstanding job delivering an incredible customer experience every day. We would not be the successful company we are today without our associates and their dedication to the customer. We have a long runway of growth ahead of us. No one is in a better position than we are to continue to give the customers the best car buying experience online or in the store and we look forward to the opportunity to continue to lead the used car retailing industry. Thanks for your interest in CarMax and your support and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call.",

My name is Victoria and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, and good morning. Thank you all for joining our fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today is Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who by the way is very proud, along with Cliff Wood, and our many CarMax JMU alumni, of the Dukes, who are playing in the FCS National Championship. And of course with us is Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 filed with the SEC. Please remember to ask only one question and a follow up before getting back in the queue. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Nash : Good morning everyone. Katharine, I was not going to mention JMU since we\u2019re a little bit more team agnostic now that Folliard has left, but since you did mention it, I\u2019m excited about it and I wish them well. For today\u2019s call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing, and then I\u2019ll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives. As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4% and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used units were driven by strong improvement conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwinds from tier three sales. The estimate used unit comps for our non-tier three customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. Our total web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website, with increased activity such as engagement with the search tool and car pages, as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally to a sale. Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession.  We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $21.55 compared to $21.60 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year\u2019s third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year\u2019s wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison.  A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four year old vehicles fell this quarter to 785 compared to 81% last year, once again as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18 store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year\u2019s third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks Bill. Good morning everybody. In recent quarters we\u2019ve discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end and we saw this continue in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix growth in CAF\u2019s net penetration which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year\u2019s third quarter.  Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and the higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you would expect, the higher credit mix applications drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing.  Tier two penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our tier two lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we\u2019ve observed in customer conversion. Tier three sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors, credit tightening early in the year and lower application volumes. Performance by our tier three partners however has been consistent since the middle of Q1.  CAF income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly. During the third quarter, we continue to see higher losses experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of any managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3 we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks Tom. During the third quarter, we opened six stores, including two in new markets Boise and Grand Rapids. We also opened four stores in existing markets, Philadelphia, Daytona, and two in San Francisco. Late in the current fourth quarter, we expect to open four more stores; two in our Los Angeles market, one in Murrieta will include a centralized production and auction facility to support our growth in Southern California. In addition, we plan to open two small format stores in the fourth quarter, both in new markets, Mobile, Alabama and Albany, New York.  Next, I\u2019d like to give an update on our new online offerings and the tests we are conducting to continue to advance the customer experience. First, as we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get prequalified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide and we\u2019re pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads. Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customer to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demands and operational scalability, while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. The last update is [regarding] a one store test we\u2019ll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost conscious and eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we are growing in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders.  Like last quarter, I remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience, both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience.  With that I will open up the call for questions, so Victoria? Operator : [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. A question on the search engine optimization you\u2019ve been working on, I think, earnestly this year. I guess I'm a little surprised that web traffic is flattish, given that. So, if you could give us an update on where you stand on search engine optimization and how much of a driver that might really be going forward. Bill Nash : Sure. Thanks Sharon. So SEO is a big focus for us. The things that we\u2019ve done so far this year to really focus on that, first of all the website which we\u2019ve talked in the past. In addition to the website, recently we\u2019ve been working on some of the design of the website to make sure that search engines can get the information in a quick, time sensitive fashion so that they can pull all the relevant data down. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on here more recently. We\u2019ve also been publishing some content that our customers want and expect, but this is an area now that we\u2019ve got the website up, we\u2019ve made some tweaks to it. This is an area that we think still has a lot of opportunity going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer Brian Nagel : Good morning. Nice quarter. My question is on used car unit comps, two parts. I'm going to shove it together. First off, a number of retailers really across the board have discussed some sales disruptions, like the change around the recent presidential election. So I know it's not typical for CarMax to talk about intra-quarter trends, but I thought maybe you could discuss that. And then the second question also relating to car sales, you talked a lot in the prepared comments about some of the internal initiatives. We've clearly seen a sequential improvement in used car unit comps over the past few quarters. From a market standpoint, has CarMax started to benefit yet from the supply of vehicles improving within the industry? Thank you Bill Nash : Yes, Brian. So on the first question, I really don\u2019t have a comment on that and the Trump effect. On the second part of the question, as it relates to the supply, I absolutely think that we are starting to see the supply come back in the auctions and I think that\u2019s a good thing for CarMax. As that supply comes back, it helps to drive the difference in price between a new car and a late model used car. So while I didn\u2019t highlight that as one of the factors in the prepared remarks, I absolutely think that that\u2019s also a contributing factor. Brian Nagel : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the wholesale business, which fell a little bit. Do you think you are seeing your fair share of appraisal traffic or are sellers starting to use some of these alternate channels, which, again, you may have access to with your new strategy? And then on a related note, how does the increase in lease activity, we've got a lot more leased cars today, impact your opportunity for appraisal given those lessees are not selling their car. Thanks. Bill Nash : Okay. On the wholesale piece, I think that\u2019s more indicative of what I talked about in the early remarks, that as the new car SAAR works its way through from the recession, the shortage of new cars, for us that\u2019s right into seven to nine year old vehicles and you know that\u2019s right in the sweet spot of wholesale. And we saw the same phenomenon earlier on when those cars were zero to four. We saw less of them coming through as appraisal traffic we expect and we\u2019re seeing the same thing come through in the seven to nine year old vehicles. So we think that\u2019s more of a factor of what\u2019s at play there. And I\u2019m sorry the second question, what was it in regards to lease activity? Craig Kennison : With the increase in overall lease activity, there are a lot of people who have cars that are leased and not therefore for sale. Does that impact your ability in the wholesale business to attract those cars? Bill Nash : No, I don\u2019t think so at this point because first of all the leases are just starting to come back at this point and our wholesale cars are generally older. I do think that as the leases come back, that\u2019s a good thing for the core business because that\u2019s a lot more selection of younger vehicles. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s having a big impact on the wholesale business. Craig Kennison : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. Within the SG&A, other than the advertising, which was down for reasons that you stated, your compensation expense was also quite well controlled. It looks like on an aggregate basis it was up only 3% year on year, this comp and benefits, and up really, barely up on a two-year basis in aggregate dollars despite a big increase in stores. Was there anything related to stock comp, which I know you have sometimes called out, or any other factor, incentive comp, that would have led this number to be so subdued here in the third quarter? Tom Reedy : Hey Matt. Yes, stock comp actually this quarter is the first time it\u2019s been at a level so small that it\u2019s not worth talking about on a year-over-year basis. But there are some good guys embedded in that comp and benefit number, both some unfavorability last year and some unfavorability this year. But despite that, we still did leverage that line relative to growth in unit sales. You could probably double the percentage increase and it would be a rough idea of what we -- kind of run rate it would be. Matthew Fassler : So, in other words, the run rate would have been something like 6% in dollars, normalized for everything, which still would have led you to good leverage. Tom Reedy : Yes, that\u2019s fair to say. Matthew Fassler : Got it. That's very helpful. I'll count that as my follow-up and come back if we have more. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Morning everybody. Just wanted to focus on the loss provision rates at CAF for a second. Is there a way that you can talk about, is this factoring in just what you are currently experiencing or does this take into account additional expected declines in used vehicle values moving forward? If it's just now, how much do you think this could continue to move down with used values coming down further from here? Tom Reedy : Let me hit on a couple of things. One is used values definitely has a impact on loss rates, but historically customer behavior has been a much bigger driver and on an ongoing basis there\u2019s many things moving. So it\u2019s hard to say that that one individual factor could have a dramatic impact on a go-forward basis. As to the determination, every quarter we determine based on what we know we to date rather than based on any kind of speculation, a 12 month look-forward on loss expectation. So as I said, it\u2019s based on historical information that we have and then how we are performing to date relative to that historical performance. So in a quarter where things are moving, you\u2019re going to see us move that loss expectation. We have not in the past when things were going good taken a view to try to get ahead of things and we haven\u2019t done that here as well. Mike Levin : Got it. Maybe to put that in a little better perspective, these current rates versus history, I know the accounting was different at the time, but could you compare where these loss rates are versus where we were, say, through the crisis? Tom Reedy : Yeah, I think well through the crisis, we typically try to manage our portfolio to kind of a 2 to 2.5% cumulative net loss rate. And the average life for these loans has been roughly two years as a proxy. So during the recession, we saw loss rates go to double that in the portfolio. But one thing I think I\u2019d point out, after one point, if you look at the size of the loan loss allowance today which is a 12 month look, it\u2019s 1.10%. So if you double that, you can see they were still well within the range of expectation in the zone that we are looking to originate. And something to remember also is that our tier three CAF is also part of that overall loan loss provision and represents almost 10% of it. Mike Levin : 10% of the 1.1%? Bill Nash : 10% of the dollar volume, the $114 million, $115 million of loan loss allowance. Mike Levin : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Bill Nash : So when we step back and look at this, yes we\u2019ve seen deterioration relative to recent years, but still not to the point where we were pre-recession. Mike Levin : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. You guys have always talked about tier 3 sales as really being incremental to the core run rate. So my question is, when CAF increases penetration, do you have an estimate what percent of those CAF sales are incremental? So in other words, is CAF financing some people that wouldn't have received credit elsewhere? Tom Reedy : I think the answer to that is yes and not necessary because we are more aggressive than other folks, but every lender has a way that they look at credit. We think we have ways to look at our applicants and find pockets that work for us that may convert at a better rate because they got a CAF offer than if they get a tier 2 or tier 3 offer. So if you look at the conversion of customers based on a CAF offer versus based on a tier 2 or 3 offer, it\u2019s much more significant. So you would expect that some of the CAF offers would be incremental just because of that phenomenon. Scot Ciccarelli : But, Tom, if you had, let's call it 7,600 extra unit sales because of the increase in CAF penetration, is there a percentage you would suggest that was incremental based on the way you guys look at your models? Tom Reedy : Like I said, there would be some incremental there, but we haven\u2019t shared anything as far as fractions. I can tell you that that percentage would not be expected to be up or down relative to recent years. Scot Ciccarelli : Right. Understood. And then related to that, because it has to do with on the credit side, given the rise in interest rates that we\u2019ve seen, I would assume that your funding costs have actually increased. Just how should we generally think about how you guys plan to manage the spread versus moving interest rates too quickly on customers with the potential for negative unit elasticity? Thanks. Tom Reedy : Well the nice thing about our business is we can test quickly and we can test pretty accurately in the CAF space. So we have seen an increase in benchmarks in recent weeks I guess if you look at it. And we have taken action to raise rates in certain pockets selectively to offset it to some extent. Now what we\u2019ll need to do is as we look at it going forward to see if the market will allow us to keep those rates up because I\u2019ve said many times we\u2019re going to be a market lender. We\u2019ve got to provide competitive rate to the customers so nobody is getting sour on CarMax over the finance offer they got. And we\u2019ll closely monitor our three day payoffs. We\u2019ll closely monitor conversion as we ramp up rates and we\u2019ll do what the market allows us. But we are - this is something that is just ongoing business as usual for CarMax Auto Finance. We are constantly testing ways to maximize the profit and sales coming from that portfolio. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Got it. I'll follow-up later. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Banc of America Merrill Lynch John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just a question on supply and the impact potentially on grosses. It seems like there's a lot of the new vehicle dealers that are getting off the stop sale wagon and retailing a lot of used vehicles they had stored on their lots in the short run. So, I'm just curious what you think about supply there. And then, also, as you look at this leasing bubble that's coming over the next three years, where you think we are in that increase in supply. And as you think about those two legs of supply increases, what you think you can do as far as holding your grosses. Are you going to stay committed to this $2,100 to $2,200 range as we see that increase in supply really pick up? Bill Nash : Yes, John. So on the first part of the question about the stop sales, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s much of an impact. Lots of dealers have been selling vehicles that have open recalls. While you\u2019ve got the franchise dealers that cannot - by the manufacturer standard, you can\u2019t sell it for that franchise, they still sell other non-brand franchise at those stores. So for me that\u2019s not really - I don\u2019t really see that as either a positive or a negative. I think it\u2019s just continuing on. As far as the lease thing, I said earlier we\u2019re seeing more vehicles come back from the leasing channels and we think it will continue through next year and even into the year after that. And I think we\u2019ve proven over time that we\u2019ve been able to hold our margin throughout many different cycles. Now the only caveat that I would give there is you know we constantly do testing and if we think that moving that margin down would more than pay for itself in units, then we would look at that. And so we will continue to test, but we feel confident that we can continue to maintain those gross profit margins. John Murphy : And if I could just follow up, we simply think that if you dropped your gross by 10% you would expect to get at least a 10% pick up in volume or else you wouldn't do it. Is that correct? Or 11% increase in volume to offset that drop in gross? How would you think about that? Bill Nash : Yes, we would want to see total more than offset the drop than what we see. So it would have to be a win on total gross. John Murphy : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore. Michael Montani : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask if I could and apologize if I missed it, but what are you seeing now in terms of SUV truck penetration? I think last year it was 23% by your measures and I was looking for it to be maybe low 30s. Could you talk about that? Bill Nash : Yeah. So our large SUV mix for the quarter was - excuse me. Our large SUV mix for the quarter was up year-over-year. It\u2019s about 25.7% versus last year\u2019s third quarter was 23.3% so it\u2019s about 250 basis points. It\u2019s up about a point from the second quarter of this year. So the mix is up a little bit, which would inherently drive our ASPs up a little bit, but then because we had a shift in some of the older vehicles, that brought the ASPs down as well acquisition process. Lower acquisition prices brought it down. So SUV mix was up a little bit. Michael Montani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Can you talk a little bit about SAAR setting and how its trending in terms of buys that you would do and appraisal weighing versus auction in other areas? Just thinking about big picture, it would seem that you would be in a better position to sort and merchandise given that acquisition cost has come down. I just wanted to see how that\u2019s playing out. Bill Nash : Is this in particular to the large SUVs or just in general? Michael Montani : No, just in general. Bill Nash : Yeah. I think what we are seeing out there is what we typically would see this time of year with fall depreciation. And I think with the fall depreciation obviously is going to lower the acquisition prices. Again, we feel like that\u2019s a good thing for us because as the acquisition prices go down, we just can pass those lower prices onto the customers and there is a bigger delta between new cars and late model used cars, so we think it\u2019s good. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about third-party lead generators, where you stand with those. And did you do anything different this quarter with the lead generators? Bill Nash : Yes. We have all of our inventory listed on - for the quarter it was on Car Gurus and that was the only site that we had our inventory listed on during the third quarter and we\u2019ll constantly test some different things, but that was the only one during the quarter. Rick Nelson : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge James Albertine : Great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask, and I know it's early, but certainly we're getting a lot of questions. We hosted a call yesterday on the subject matter in fact. Wanted to understand your thinking and maybe what you're hearing from your advisors as it relates to tax planning for next year and maybe some of the pushes and pulls as you think about the potential deductibility of CapEx or PP&E and maybe the reversal of deducting interest expense, and so forth, as well as the reduction in corporate tax rate. So just any strategy thoughts there would be helpful in helping us frame how you guys are thinking about it relative to peers, even. Thanks. Bill Nash : Well James, since you had a call yesterday, maybe you should brief us on it because you probably have more information that we do. We really don\u2019t have any thoughts at this point. It\u2019s all so new and there\u2019s so much up in the air. It\u2019s just it\u2019s too early to really talk about. James Albertine : Okay, great. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, everyone. So you mentioned a small increase in overall traffic into the stores, but you also had a reduction in appraisal traffic. Are you seeing any change in consumer behavior in terms of fewer people coming in with trade-ins? What do you think explains for that apparent disparity? Bill Nash : I think like you said, we saw a small increase in store traffic and I talked a little bit about store traffic last quarter in that you really can\u2019t look at just store traffic by itself. You really have to look at web traffic and especially for us, leads and store traffic to understand the overall big picture. Consumers are a lot more educated. We know that of the consumers that buy vehicles from us, nine out of 10 of them have already done a lot of research on CarMax.com. So they\u2019re already much better educated. I think on the difference between getting a little bit more store traffic in and get appraisal traffic down. Again, a lot of it is tied to what we\u2019re seeing as the SAAR rate works its way through the bubble. And I think that\u2019s a main driver of why you see some of the appraisal traffic down. Bill Armstrong : Because they are getting less money for the \u2026 Bill Nash : Just because there aren\u2019t as many. So like I talked about earlier, the seven to nine year old vehicles, there just aren\u2019t as many as there were because seven to nine years ago the new car sales rates were going down. So if there aren\u2019t as many customers that have those cars, they\u2019re obviously not coming in to get them appraised. Bill Armstrong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. You guys called out increase in the mix of sales to higher credit customers and their supply of late-model vehicles, but at the same time you are selling a higher mix of older vehicles. Can you help square away that dynamic, which has occurred for the last two quarters now? Bill Nash : Yes. I think contrary to what a lot of people think is that your tier 3 customers are going to be the ones buying your late model or your older, less expensive vehicles and for us, that\u2019s just not the case. Majority of the vehicles that we sell of the older, less expensive vehicles are to non-tier 3 customers. So I think what it says is that the consumers are still out there looking for a great deal and they\u2019ve opted to go a little bit older and a little bit cheaper. So I think that explains the dynamic. It\u2019s not just tier 3 customers that would be buying older, less expensive vehicles. Seth Basham : Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up, considering the increased supply of late-model vehicles, would you expect your mix to shift back to that direction over the next few quarters? Bill Nash : Seth, we\u2019ll sell whatever the consumers want. So if the consumers want that late model vehicle, then we\u2019ll absolutely adjust our inventory accordingly. If they want to continue to buy older vehicles, then you won\u2019t see that change. So it just depends. It\u2019s all driven by consumer demand. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about the future in e-commerce with the pilot programs you are doing. Obviously there are consumers who want this process to be very easy, but at the same time it's still roughly a $20,000 purchase for people. So how willing do you think people are to buy a vehicle without even coming into the store to do a test drive? Is it a small portion of the American public? Is it ultimately going to be a lot of people? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Bill Nash : It\u2019s a good question, David and I think you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s not an easy transaction. It\u2019s a complicated transaction. That being said, I do think there\u2019s a small subset of customers that want to try that experience. I think for us, we certainly are going to meet those customers wherever and however they want to do business, but I think more importantly is that I think consumers will want to do more of the transaction online in the near term and we will have the ability to not only do more of the transaction online, but it will be a seamless integration into the store. And I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. In addition to giving the customers the ability to do everything, it really is okay, you want to do part of it online. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a great experience and then when you walk into the store we just pick up from where you left off and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. I think that\u2019s really where the consumer demand is going to be in the near term. David Whiston : Okay, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask a comment about buybacks. Stock has been near a 52-week high. Are those still full steam ahead? Tom Reedy : Pardon me. I didn\u2019t hear the tail end of your question. David Whiston : The stock is near a 52-week high. Are buybacks still full steam ahead or are you looking to be a bit more cautious on that going forward? Tom Reedy : As we\u2019ve discussed before, we take an enlightened averaging in methodology to repurchases. So at any given time, we\u2019re trying to average into the market and maintain our capital structure in the zone that we\u2019ve targeted. You saw that in this quarter we bought back $199 million versus $125 million in Q2. That did represent a little bit of a step up in aggressiveness because we saw some weakness in the stock price, but the parameters we put in place allow for a little bit of that, allows us to be a little more aggressive when the price is weak and a little more conservative when the volume and price is looking strong. But we intend to be in the market on a regular basis. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Paresh Jain : Morning everyone. Just a quick question on inventory resourcing. Would it be fair to say that you currently source about 40% of your inventory from auction? How has that number changed in the last two years, if that's changed at all? Bill Nash : So when we think about self-sufficiency which is opposite of the auctions, but actually getting it through our own appraisal and we\u2019ve given the range of 40% to 50%, we\u2019re at the lower end of that range, but we\u2019re higher than we were a year ago and we\u2019re very similar to where we are last quarter. Paresh Jain : And a follow-up on the profitability of the vehicles sourced from auction, has the gap in profitability with those sourced through trade-ins changed at all in the last two years? I think the gap is about hundreds of dollars between the two. Bill Nash : So the vehicles that we source through our appraisaling are still more profitable than the ones that we source offsite. As you can imagine, you don\u2019t have transportation fees. You don\u2019t have folks going out and incurring expenses, that kind of thing. So there\u2019s still about the same amount of profitability over what they were before. Paresh Jain : And no change in the last two years in that gap? Bill Nash : I can\u2019t speak really off the top of my head on the last two years, but it\u2019s been very similar. Paresh Jain : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Did you guys give out the zero to four mix this quarter, like you historically have, and how that compared versus last year? Bill Nash : Zero to four we were down slightly 81 to 78. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then just a follow-up to that, given the scarcity of those cars given supply, I'm wondering if you're holding back more of those vehicles from wholesale to sell it used, if the two are related at all. Bill Nash : Actually I think that supply is starting to come back on those so we\u2019re seeing more out there. But as far as the selectivity, we\u2019re always looking at selectivity when we purchase a car, whether we designate it wholesale or we put it through. I would say at this point when you\u2019re talking about zero to four year old cars, we really haven\u2019t changed anything recently as far as selectivity goes. Chris Bottiglieri : I'm sorry. I meant holding back the seven to nines where you had tighter supply. Have you held back some of those from wholesale to retail at this point? Bill Nash : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s considerably different than what we\u2019ve been doing before. It really depends on the vehicles as they roll through. If they\u2019re good quality vehicles and we can turn them into CarMax cars, then we\u2019re going to do that. But we look at selectivity every single quarter and make the decisions that are appropriate at that point. I wouldn\u2019t say that this one is necessarily - there hasn\u2019t been a big change in this quarter versus other quarters. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, great. Then one quick follow-up. Two questions have been asked on auction supply. It seems to me just looking at the auction data that there seems to be a mix of improvement in SUV and truck availability at the auction lanes. Has that been a driver for your business in terms of increased SUV and truck penetration? Bill Nash : I think it\u2019s, when you see that increased inventory, that will drive the prices down and that probably has a factor. It is a factor into where the customers want to buy the car, depending on how attractive it is from a price standpoint. But again, we really go off of customer demand and if they\u2019re looking for large SUVs and we can get them at prices that they\u2019ll pay, then we\u2019ll put them on our front lot. Just this quarter folks were looking more for older, cheaper cars and so that\u2019s what we did. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for the commentary. Operator : We do have a follow up from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning again. If we were to be able to accurately calculate how new space productivity looked versus a year ago just in terms of raw numbers, what do you think we would see? And how did new store performance compare to your expectations? Bill Nash : We\u2019re pleased with new store performance. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s difficult to talk about store productivity when you look at the size of stores that we\u2019re building, when you throw in the small formats, when you look at going into new metro markets where awareness is at different levels. You\u2019re going to have different ramping up. All the new stores are reaching profitability quicker than the old stores because of the GPU and they\u2019re also meeting all of our internal rate of return. So we\u2019re pleased with new store productivity. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then, secondly, I know you are far more focused on your customers than on your competition, but we did see one piece of competitive fallout with one of the higher-profile, albeit small, online startups essentially ceasing operations in its prior form and merging with another company. What\u2019s your sense about the competitive environment online? Is it intensifying? Are you starting to see any signs of more rationalization in terms of the kind of offers that your customers can pursue away from CarMax? Bill Nash : I think first of all just a comment on your first part about the online competitor ceasing operation. I think it goes back to something I talked about earlier which this is not a simple business. This is a hard business. It\u2019s not easy to go out, source inventory for the right amount. It\u2019s not easy to go out and put a cash offer on every single car. And I think that\u2019s just an indication of why some of these folks are struggling. I think competition is hot in both the online space and the traditional and I think our challenge is to make sure that we continue to leverage the equities that have made it successful and them even better and leverage our data and our processes and our systems and our people to continue to widen the gap between us and our competition.  And like I said earlier, we\u2019ve got 23 years\u2019 worth of experience and 23 years\u2019 worth of data and we\u2019re leveraging that data and tapping into it in ways that we haven\u2019t been able to and haven\u2019t done in the past. So although the competition is hot and heavy, we feel really good about the positon that we\u2019re in and I think ultimately to be as successful as we can be, we do need to make sure that we can be in the online space, but equally important is we\u2019ve got to be in the brick and mortar space. I think you have to do both very, very well and I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves to do just that. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next follow up comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. I guess this is a bit of a follow up on Matt's question. But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, on some of these delivery tests, are there any key differences to what you are trying to do versus the guys like Vroom and Beepi? And also, how is it that you are allowed to close a transaction outside of the dealership? Because I guess I was always under the impression just legally you had to close the transaction at a dealership. Thanks? Bill Nash : So on the second part of your question, there are some states where you can\u2019t close it outside of the dealership. Our delivery, where we\u2019re doing our tests, that\u2019s obviously not the case. I think as far as differences, one of the difference in our home delivery test is you don\u2019t have to buy the vehicle before we bring it out to you. We\u2019ll bring it to you. You can test drive it at your home and if you decide to purchase it, we can do the transaction right there. That\u2019s different than any other tests that are out there where they make you purchase the vehicle before it\u2019s brought out to you. Again, it\u2019s a small test. We\u2019re trying to understand exactly what the customers want and the good thing is we can adjust the test as we move forward. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Bill Nash : Hey Scott, I think Tom was just saying, he thinks maybe one online competitors might allow you to \u2026 Tom Reedy : Yes. There\u2019s one that allows you to test drive, but they also make you give up your car as they\u2019re trying to sell it. Bill Nash : That\u2019s right. Scot Ciccarelli : I'm sorry, can you repeat that? It was broken up. Tom Reedy : There is one competitor that allows you to test drive as a purchaser, but they\u2019re a C2C enabler and the other part of their business offer is that they take possession of your car while you\u2019re attempting to sell it so you don\u2019t have use of your vehicle. Bill Nash : Yes. So there\u2019s nobody doing it exactly the way we are from a business to consumer, but to Tom\u2019s point, there\u2019s a C2C that will allow you to test drive without purchasing it beforehand. Tom Reedy : I think it\u2019s important. I think when we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re not doing anything that inhibits the customer from wanting to transact with us. Bill Nash : Yes. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. Thanks, gentlemen. Operator : Your next follow up comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. James Albertine : Great. Thanks for taking the follow up here. And then on the same theme, on the online versus your traditional sourcing methods, I was curious, from a qualitative perspective, given you are now pretty far along in terms of your investments digitally, how do you think about operating margin? Are there any differences in the final operating income contribution whether you have sourced the customer through an online channel versus a traditional mechanism? And if you can maybe at a high level talk about what are the differences and pushes and pulls from an expense perspective that we should think about that drive that delta, if there is one? Bill Nash : So James, I think it\u2019s a little early to be talking about the differences. While we\u2019re committed to expanding our online capability, we really we have such a small test going on home delivery and outside of that, all the other online capabilities customers are utilizing them and then transitioning into the store. So it\u2019s a little early to talk about the economics of one versus the other and the delta. James Albertine : Okay. Then maybe a quick follow-up. You\u2019ve done a great job of laying out milestones for us historically to think about pilot programs. Are there any additional measures that we should look for in terms of calendar 2017? Any other major investments coming or looming that you thought about and are willing to articulate, at least from a qualitative perspective? Bill Nash : No, I think the one that I highlight was one that we were going to be doing in the fourth which is the online appraisals and then in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll highlight any new ones for the upcoming year. James Albertine : Okay. Great. Thanks again. Operator : You do have another follow up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore. Michael Montani : Hey, guys, I just wanted to follow up on two things. One is for Tom, if you could just quantify what recovery rates were like in the quarter and contextualize that for us. And then, secondly, what are you seeing in terms of credit availability from some of your third-party lenders? If memory serves, I think it was last March or April that you saw a noteworthy pullback from one of the largest ones. Tom Reedy : So as far as recovery rates, it\u2019s down a couple of points year over year in the quarter, but as I mentioned, consumer behavior in payments and recovery, them recovering themselves out of trouble tends to be more impactful. And I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite get the tail end of your last question. Michael Montani : I guess the last question was just, you did the 10% comp if you back out third-party subprime. I guess the question is, do you start to cycle the pullback in March, April, if memory serves? And then, also, what are you seeing in terms of lender behavior from third parties? Does it appear stable at this level or is there further pullback that you can see now? Tom Reedy : Sure. As far as cycling, I think in the current period right now we\u2019ll begin to cycle over the trend we began observing in traffic. So remember we\u2019ve been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume at the lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease we\u2019ll start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tightening we saw was in mid Q1 from one of our tier 3 lenders. Since that time they have been behaving very consistently. If we look at conversion of customers in the tier 3 space, since the middle of Q1 it\u2019s been very consistent. It\u2019s below last year, but it\u2019s been consistent. So yes, all else equal, in April you start to see us rolling over that on a year over year basis. In the tier 2 space, it\u2019s almost exactly the opposite phenomenon. Conversion has been consistently better than last year since the first quarter and as I mentioned, they\u2019re doing a great job of converting the volume that they see. A lot of the mix they\u2019re now foreseeing, a lot of it is from the customer traffic coming through the door. That\u2019s why CAF is up. That\u2019s why other is up and that\u2019s why that tier 2 and 3 are down. Michael Montani : So, are you guys happy with the third-party subprime where it's at now at around 10%, or could we consider new lenders that might help to grow that again? Tom Reedy : I think it\u2019s going to be a matter of - obviously it\u2019s going to be a matter what customers come through. We\u2019re happy today with the amount we\u2019re investing in the tier 3 space, which is about $1,000 a car of margin that we give away in order to enable those transactions. The tier 3 space is a lot more fragmented than the more prime space and other lending. We\u2019re happy with the performance of our partners. We test other partners occasionally and to the extent one can add value, we consider bringing them in the mix. But I think if you step back and think about our current base as a platform for growing, it\u2019s a much more profitable dynamic to grow at this mix than to have the mix migrate back to something higher. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Your next follow up comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks for taking the follow-up question. Just thinking about the fact that most of your customers are shopping online before visiting the stores, as you consider the store model of the future what kind of changes are you thinking about? We notice, for example, in the Seattle area you're opening a pretty large megastore, which is likely a reconditioning focused facility in a lower cost area. Is that something you'll consider in other markets too? Bill Nash : Yes. I think what you\u2019re seeing in Seattle is more driven by the market dynamics and what\u2019s available land wise. Obviously we\u2019re looking at our store prototypes. We\u2019ve got the small format store out there. You\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve opened more of those here more recently. I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll stay close to as we better understand the customer desire for transacting more and more parts of the transaction online. But I tell you, it\u2019s not like we have 1,000 stores around the country. We have 169 stores and I think they\u2019re all strategically located and the product we sell, you need space and you need places to build those cars. So I feel very comfortable with our growth strategy, what we\u2019ve done so far and I feel very comfortable with what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline currently. Seth Basham : All right. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next follow up comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Thanks, guys. I wanted to follow up on your comments about increasing applications at the high end of the credit spectrum. And you said you also bought some market data that you were taking a look at. Just wondering if you could maybe put a few numbers behind what you are seeing at CarMax, how that compares to what you are seeing within the market. Are you outperforming those increases? And then how we might think about higher credits being a larger percentage of your mix impacting loss rates going forward. Bill Nash : I\u2019ll start with the last one. We\u2019ll see how it impacts loss rates going forward depending on the environment. It\u2019s way too early to tell. We\u2019re not in a positon to give you any numbers regarding this, but I can give you a little color around what we looked at. We bought data related to auto inquiries, meaning folks that are hitting the bureaus in conjunction with an application for credit for an automobile for the past several years, both through submissions to captives and submissions or inquiries through the major dealer groups. And while we likely started feeling the phenomenon a little earlier, the data is telling us that the lower and lower middle part of the credit spectrum has seen a year over year decline in recent quarters for everybody. As far as the higher credit folks and the growth there, our data appears to show that we are growing a little bit stronger than the rest of them, but there could be a lot of factors between new car mix, used car mix et cetera that drives that. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything really to take away from that. Mike Levin : Okay. I appreciate the color. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thanks, Victoria. In closing, I just want to thank you for joining us today. I want to thank you for your continued support. I also want to thank our 23,000 associates that are working for us across the country. Our success is absolutely due to them and the exceptional customer service they provide on a daily basis. And I\u2019m really proud of everything they\u2019ve accomplished this year. I wish everyone a wonderful holiday and happy new year and we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today as usual is Bill Nash, our present and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, filed with the SEC and soon to be replaced with our new 10-K. Before we turn the call over to Bill, I of course want to thank you in advance for asking only one question and a follow-up before getting into queue. And I also want to alert you to the fact that Richmond is having pretty loudly whether this morning. So we are hoping, we will stay online and plugged in, but if not, we have hopefully a backup plan, we\u2019ll see what happens. Bill? Bill Nash : Okay. Thank you, Katharine and good morning, everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll start off by reviewing the key highlights for the quarter and then turn the call over to Tom who will cover financing, I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our growth and strategic initiatives. As you read in our press release this morning, our used unit comps for the fourth quarter increased by 8.7%, and total used units grew by 13.4%. Total used unit comps were driven by strong improvement in conversion as well as by a modest increase in store traffic. As you know, we track market share data on a calendar year basis and our data shows that in our comp market, we increased our share of zero- to 10-year-old vehicles by approximately 2% in calendar 2016. Our core business remains very strong as we estimate used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers grew 15.3%, which is the highest comp we have recorded for our non-Tier 3 business in many years, but we again saw a headwind from Tier 3 sales. Similar to last quarter, we believe there were a number of reasons for our growth in unit sales. Strong store execution continued to benefit from enhancements to the online customer experience that we\u2019ve made throughout the year including capabilities like the new online finance pre-qualification product. Website performance continues to support sales. Total web traffic grew 3% over the prior year\u2019s quarter. As we previously said, one of our goals for the website is to drive more leads which we continued to do this quarter. Gross profit per used unit was $2,134 compared to $2,109 in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the 24th consecutive quarter that we managed to have gross profit dollar per unit of between $2,100 and $2,200. We continue to achieve this level of dollar GPU despite fluctuations in used vehicle prices and a challenging competitive environment. The growing supply of off lease vehicles and its impact on our business seems to be a hot topic. As we previously said, we continue to believe that increasing supply is a good thing for CarMax's business. We believe lower prices will be beneficial to sales as cars are more affordable for our customers. We have consistently demonstrated that we're able to manage our dollar gross profit per unit regardless of the pricing environment which includes times of sudden price decline and other periods of high off lease volume. We believe that our inventory management system is a significant competitive advantage, especially during periods of fluctuating prices. Our wholesale units declined by about 1% in the fourth quarter. The growth in our store base and a higher buy rate were more than offset by lower appraisal traffic. We believe that late tax refunds also impacted appraisal traffic. As we have discussed in previous quarters we continued to see a lower supply of older seven to nine year old vehicles that correlates to the years of decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession. As this new bubble moves into older vehicles, we would expect wholesale unit sales to normalize. Gross profit per wholesale units decreased to $938 compared to $1,005 in last year's fourth quarter. We believe this was due to several factors including the delay in tax refunds, the decrease in seven to nine year old vehicles, which are some of our more profitable wholesale vehicles, and a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter when wholesale gross profit per unit was unusually high from a historical perspective. A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year-old vehicles was approximately the same as last year's fourth quarter at 77%. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks rose by over 3 percentage points to 28% in this fourth quarter. Now on SG&A, expenses for the fourth quarter increased 15.4% to $385 million. This growth was due to a variety of factors. First, it reflects the 13% or 20 store increase in our base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year. It also incorporates a $12 million increase in share-based compensation expense, which relates like every quarter to non-executive compensation units that are settled in cash. Just as a reminder, share based compensation expenses driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during this quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter, in this case it was based on an increase in prices of about $7 in this fourth quarter versus a decrease of $11 in last year's fourth quarter. Some other factors that drove SG&A included the increase in variable costs due to our higher-level sales, a spending related to our strategic initiatives, and higher advertising costs. Remember that our advertising expense last year was higher in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter due to the timing of our new brand launch. While we reported deleverage of approximately $39 per unit, this includes a $61 per unit impact of share based compensation expense. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks Bill, good morning everybody. In the fourth quarter, we saw the same trends in customer flow that we've been discussing all year. We continue to experience increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less applications at the lower end. We believe that Tier 3 volume in the fourth quarter was also impacted by a delay in tax refunds, which as you may have seen from IRS data was about 10% lower year-over-year, in late February. This move continued to drive opportunities for cash and growth in sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing to the table. Cash net penetration increased to 43% compared to 42% in last year's fourth quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose 13.2% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. This was due to a combination of both CarMax sales growth and despite some tightening of credit standards versus last year, higher penetration driven by the better credit mix. These were partially offset by a lower average amounts financed. As you saw in today's press release, we've included information on financing penetration by channel, including CAF, Tier 2, Tier 3 and other. Penetration is shown prior to three-day payoffs in order to highlight the mix of financing utilized at the point-of-sale and we hope this will be a useful information for you. We again saw a strong performance by our Tier 2 partners despite lighter application volumes. Penetration grew slightly to 18.2% versus 17.9% in last year's fourth quarter. Third-party Tier 3 sales mix was 9.4% of used unit sales compared to 14.5% for the same period last year. Consistent with last year, CAF Tier 3 activity remained at less than 1% of sales. The decrease in Tier 3 penetration resulted from the factors we have been discussing, lower application volume and credit tightening as well as the delay in tax refunds. Despite the headwinds from Tier 3, we had comps at 8.7% and 5.4% in the past two quarters. This means we have more than offset the missing sales to Tier 3 customers with sales at the higher end of the credit spectrum, which were more profitable for CarMax. CAF income fell 10% to approximately $83 million compared to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016. While average managed receivables grew by 11.5% to $10.5 billion, the provision for loan losses increased and the portfolio interest margin decreased modestly. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charges customers at 7.4% compared to 7.5% a year ago, and 7.3% in the third quarter. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables. This compared to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of last year and 5.8% in the third quarter. As can see from our last year's [ph] securitization, the cost of funds has grown due to increasing benchmark rates. We have tested and implemented increased APRs to preserve our interest margin to the extent the market will let us and as always we will continue to test rates and origination strategy to optimize income for CAF and for CarMax overall. The ending allowance for loan losses at $124 million was 1.16% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.10% last quarter and 0.99% in last year's fourth quarter. Most of the sequential increase from 1.0% to 1.16% was driven by an update in the assumptions we used to construct our loss allowance. In the fourth quarter, our loss experience was largely as expected when we booked the allowance at the end of Q3. However, each year-end, we review the assumptions we used to project future losses. Our loss production methodology is based on historical experience and this year we have incorporated heavier weighting on more recent data points, which resulted in an approximately $5 million being added to the allowance. Couple of things to remember here. In the years leading up to fiscal 2017 our loss experience has been quite favorable and approximately 10% of the loss allowance relates to our Tier 3 program, as is expected. This as you know is funded separately from our core securitization program. As we have consistently demonstrated in other areas of our business, we believe that CAF is also nimble in reacting to changes in market conditions. We believe we are originating a highly financeable, profitable portfolio and that the current level of loss allowance remains consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix. Turning to our capital structure. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $101 million and for the full year, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at cost of $558 million. At the end of the year, we had 1.6 billion remaining in our authorization. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. During the fourth quarter, we opened four stores including two in new markets Mobile, Alabama and Albany, New York and two in our existing Los Angeles market. During the year, we opened a total of 15 stores and had 173 stores opened at the end of fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we currently plan to again open 15 stores. Lastly, we were excited to open our first two stores in the Seattle market. Also during the first quarter we\u2019ve opened a store in Pensacola, Florida. Of the 15 stores we plan to open this year, six are in metropolitan's statistical areas or MSAs having populations of 600,000 or less, which we now define as small market. It\u2019s important to note that on average we would expect smaller MSA stores to sell less vehicles in their midsized and large MSA counterparts. We also announced in our press release that we plan to open 13 to 16 stores in fiscal 2019. Now, let me take a few minutes update you on several of our initiatives to advance our online offerings and the test we are conducting to continue to enhance the customer experience. Last quarter, we talked to you about our new online financing capability to help customers get prequalified for a loan. It was available in all stores for the entire fourth quarter and we\u2019re pleased with the results so far. The future is resonating well customers and contributed to increased leads, which we believe generate incremental sales. In the fourth quarter, we kicked off a test of an online appraisal offering in Charlotte, this is a new digital solution for our customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value by submitting information online without having to come into the store. Customers are engaging well with the product and we will continue to focus on refining and testing. In regard to search engine optimization, we made substantial improvements in order to capture the full opportunity to drive customers to our website through their online search. Non-brand [indiscernible] visits which are searches they don\u2019t include the name CarMax have more than doubled since June of last year. This contributed to our overall web traffic and lead growth. We are proud of these results and we will continue to invest in both innovation and execution in the coming fiscal year. We are confident that all of our initiatives both online and in-store will ensure CarMax continues to lead the industry and deliver an exceptional car buying experience. We realize that there is a lot of noise right now in the market and concerns about the macro environment, but we\u2019re confident about the track that we\u2019re on in the future outlook for the CarMax business. Now, I will open up the call for questions. Victoria? Operator : Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks for all the details that you offered up, particularly on credit. I have one question related to that, so the highest decibel level in the marketplace seems to relate to the apparent decline in used car prices based on the recent NADA data. I will try to make this one question, but is what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace consistent with some of those headlines and to what degree does the adjustment in the provisioning reflect assumptions on recovery rates in sync with accelerated used car declines? Thanks so much. Bill Nash : Hi, Matt. I will start with your last question. The adjustment in the allowance for loan losses does not include any prognostication or reaction to recoveries in specific. We base our loss allowance on -- with real experience and on some historical data, so the adjustment that we made was really refinement in the assumptions that we used around that relating to the part that is based on historical data and we have elected to wait, recent experience a little bit heavier than longer-term experience. So that I think that\u2019s question one. I think with regard to wholesale recovery rates, all else equal, weaker rate does put some pressure on loss experience, but I think as we've said in the past, there are several factors that come into play and the customer's willingness and/or ability to pay is a much more powerful driver than what we\u2019re recovering on the losses. Anecdotally, if you\u2019re looking at a $15,000 car loan, this difference between recovering 50% and getting $7,500 and flipping three percentage points and only getting $7,050 is very de minimis relative to being able to keep that customer in the car and not lose the entire deal altogether. And since no one can predict the future, we\u2019re making our credit decisions with the knowledge that we have and the knowledge that recoveries can fall within a range in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So I think my question is probably going to follow-up on Matt\u2019s question, but a lot of focus on the finance business and specifically the provision rate. So the question right there is, you took provision up again here in the fourth quarter, you gave some commentary around that, but any -- can we better contextualize that as how we should think about at least the puts and takes for the provision rate going into 2017, recognizing you don\u2019t give guidance, but just how should we think about how that number is likely to progress through 2017? And then related to that, I guess, as my follow-up, as we\u2019ve taken provisions up, and you think you've made it very clear that losses as measured by various metrics are still within your comfort zone, but has there been any commensurate tightening and lending standards on the part of CAF? Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure, sure. I\u2019ll hit your questions in order there, Brian. As far as looking forward into provision, by definition, the provision is what we believe losses to be over the next 12 months, and it is our best estimate at the time given the information we have, very difficult to speak to the future. Now, as I mentioned, we conducted an examination of how to construct the loan allowance, and our methodology relies on both what\u2019s going on currently and historical experience because you can\u2019t really predict the future. The fact that we've moved to a heavier weighting on recent experience is likely to result in the model being a little bit more reactive to changes in both directions. That\u2019s on the things that's good or bad, but we\u2019ve always got to be careful when we\u2019re talking about the loan allowance because one period isn\u2019t always telling on what\u2019s going on in the marketplace over time. So it\u2019s really a balance between kind of speed of reacting to what\u2019s going on currently and the risk of selling back and forth by overreacting in the long run. I guess that's as much color as I can give you on that. And as far as CAF and our credit standards, we're always looking at pockets where we can expand, where we contract. We have taken some deliberate measures over the past year to tighten credit, to improve what we expect losses to come out at, and as we always do, the folks down at Atlanta will continue to look at that on an ongoing basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I have a non-finance-related question. I know you would be excited. Some more on the SG&A side, obviously, there was a lot of stock comp increase this year and you talked through a little bit about that. I'm just wondering first, kind of what you think a good ballpark number is for dollars and stock comp for fiscal '18? I mean I'm assuming it's not going to go up $40 million again but maybe you can correct me. And then secondarily, do you still think like a mid-single-digit comp you can kind of hold SG&A on an ongoing basis? I know there's a stair-step increase in digital initiatives and so on. We're starting to lap some of that, so I'm trying of think about this next year, what kind of a comp you need to hold that SG&A? Tom Reedy : Okay, Sharon. So on your first question, the stock-based comp, what do we think, where do we think that's going. We don't know where it's going. If it did go up another $40 million, that will probably be a good thing for us. But we have no idea to where that's going to go. And as far as the leverage on SG&A, we've said we need mid-single digits to comp. I would still hold to that. I would say we would probably need to be at the higher end because of the investments that we're putting into the business, but we still would stand by that range. Sharon Zackfia : And just to clarify, a higher end to leverage SG&A or just to hold SG&A as a percent of sales? Bill Nash : It's a leverage to leverage SG&A. Sharon Zackfia : And sorry, one more follow-up on the stock comp. I know you can't predict it because of where the stock might be, but if you -- if the stock was the same price today, I mean, is it going -- is it pretty static? Or I'm just trying to figure out from a grand perspective what's going on? Tom Reedy : Yes, I think it could be pretty static, but --. Bill Nash : There'll be some growth in headcount and pay at the company because we are going15-ish for of the year. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : First, just hopefully this is a housekeeping item and doesn't count against my questions, but the vehicle finance penetration rates, what's the difference between the 43% Tom talked about and the 48.4% in the release? Is that just a difference in the three-day payoffs? Tom Reedy : Yes, exactly, Scot. I guess I wasn't clear enough in my remarks. We wanted to give you a flavor for what financing channels we're enabling sales at point-of-sale, we're all going to continue to disclose CAF net penetration and the difference it represents as payoff. Scot Ciccarelli : All right. Got it, thank you. And then I'm going to switch back to the finance piece. When you guys look at the change in your latest securitization funding rate, do you have any estimate or gauge, how much of that was the increase that we saw in terms of short -- the increase or change in short-term rates and how much was for maybe investors looking for a bit more yield as they've seen loss rates increasing? Obviously, that increases their risk profile? Tom Reedy : Yes, I think the data available is public. But if you look at the spread on 2017-1, I think you'll see that benchmarks were up about 56 basis points, and spreads were virtually spread across over benchmark were virtually the same as in prior years. So we have seen and I\u2019ll hit on this because it's probably your next question, Scott, is we did -- we have seen some escalation in benchmark rates, so that effort just meant some increase in the cost of funds for the securitization market. And as I mentioned during the quarter, we did cast and then rollout rate increases, which were pretty much 50 basis points across the board for CAF. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And is the plan to just kind of maintain your spread at that point? Or you have to be careful about the elasticity for the customers, right? I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out going forward. Tom Reedy : That\u2019s exactly right, Scot. It's a balancing act between preserving that spread and preserving the best overall income for CarMax. So as I\u2019ve said many times before we can only do if the markets going to allow us. So one thing that we are very good at CAF is testing things quickly, and we have the ability to do that by kind of running different champion challengers strategy. And so if when we see rates increase, we can test rates, we'll look to see how many people stick with CAF versus 3-day pass, but we\u2019ll also look to see how that impacts our conversion at CarMax. As we\u2019ve got to bear in mind that we don\u2019t want to upset people over a finance offer for charging more than what the market would bear. Also, the guy that comes in on Saturday afternoon and buy the car from CarMax utilizing CAF and then pays off is better than the guy that comes in then goes to credit union on Monday and might end up somewhere else, so there is a lot of factors that we have to look at to ensure that we\u2019re optimizing both CAF and CarMax. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : With web traffic up 3% and a nearly 9%, comp conversion clearly appears to be very healthy, to what extent can you attribute that strength in conversion to recent improvements in the digital experience online? Bill Nash : Craig, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exact amounts that are driving. In my opening remarks I talked about several different factors. Some of this improvement on the customer experience. Some of the improvement that we\u2019ve made for website and SEO. I would also add to that, we had and Tom talked about that in his remarks, we had a higher mix of high credit customers. And as you know, high credit customers convert better than lower credit customers. So that has an impact on it as well. I think inventory availability had an impact, so there\u2019s a lot of different factors and it\u2019s hard to quantify how much the web is driving it versus all these other factors, including just better execution at the store level. Craig Kennison : And then a point of clarification, I think you said your share improved two percentage points. Can you give us the actual market share estimate that you consider? Tom Reedy : Yeah, it\u2019s actually, it improved 2% and again this is comp market share growth. And the comp markets, we\u2019re still in the range of total share about 4% to 5%, which is similar to where we were last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Liz Suzuki : This is Liz Suzuki on for John. The extended protection plan revenues increased pretty substantially. In the press release, you mentioned favorable adjustment for the reserve for cancellations. Can you just quantify what that favorable adjustment was and whether it should impact EPP revenues in the quarters ahead? Tom Reedy : There\u2019s a lot of things that will go into impacting EPP revenues in the quarters ahead. So I can\u2019t state how it will affect. But as you saw, we\u2019re up about $13.6 million in EPP revenue and margin, because it\u2019s the same thing. The majority of it was due to the combination of kind of sales growth, pricing changes and our penetration. We saw penetration dropped a little bit, but that's mainly expected due to the higher credit quality mix of customers. Those folks that bring their own financing, which you saw growth from 20% to 24% this quarter, are less likely to attach on those extended products. The remainder of it, which is about 5 million was due to year-over-year changes in the return reserve activity. Liz Suzuki : Just one follow-up on what you mentioned about those getting financing elsewhere, are those mostly people paying in actual cash, or are they getting finance from like local credit unions and other sources? Tom Reedy : We don't have visibility to that actual data. But my hunch would be majority of them are doing finance -- are financing in some way, shape or form. But it represents both people who come to the table with cash or their own money, and people who close the transaction with CarMax or one of the partners and then we do it later. Liz Suzuki : But either way, you wouldn't have any credit risk in those loans? Bill Nash : No, absolutely not. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore. Mike Montani : I wanted to first ask, in the press release you mentioned that there was tightening in credit standards early in the year. Can you just expand and elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you're seeing from the various lenders, and how that's trended right up until current day? And then related thing was, can you talk a little bit about, Tom, normalized provision rates and spreads, and how quickly we should expect those to be realized in the business as we look ahead? Tom Reedy : Sure, I can talk to the first one. As we've been talking about through the year we did experience some tightening with our third-party Tier 3 lenders and if you remember, that was in the middle of the first quarter of this year. Since then, their behavior has been relatively consistent. I can't speak to how they behave and what their appetite is going forward. But since middle of the first quarter of last year, it's been relatively consistent behavior from those partners. As I mentioned, our Tier 2 partners have been very successful and very -- and more aggressive. They're doing more with less and we're very happy with their performance. As far as normalization, that's going to be based on whatever the marketplace will bear. From the perspective of a loss ratio, or expected allowance, remember at 1.16, that includes our Tier 3 activity, which is as we've talked about before in our releases and our disclosure, is about 10% of the overall allowance, and it only represents 1% of the portfolio. So I mean, if you kind of -- doubling the reserve as a proxy for expected [indiscernible] net loss, we're still very comfortable that we're generating a portfolio that's within the range of expectation, that we target in order to be able to access the securitization market. Now there is no hard and fast rules. This is a range that we target and there have been times when it's been at the high end and low end, and I think we'll keep an eye on how things are performing. We maintain close dialogues with the rating agencies and we'll continue to originate a portfolio that we can fund. From a spread perspective, normal is going to be whatever the market will bear. We're still looking pretty good relative to kind of the decade of the 2000s as far as spread even given some increases in interest rates. But as I've said before, when we see interest rates move, we're going to attempt to preserve that spread. But if we -- if by testing, looking at 3-day pass, looking at conversion that we determine that the market won\u2019t bear it, then we\u2019re going to be a market lender. So I can\u2019t really tell you where that the market for finance is going to go through. We dependent on the appetite of our competitors. Mike Montani : Is there a long-term normal for provisioning rate, though of like 1.5% or 2%? I feel like you\u2019ve given that number in the past. I just wanted to see how you --? Tom Reedy : No, I don\u2019t think, we have, because we\u2019ve only been provisioning since accounting change in 2010. We\u2019ve give a range of where we expect cumulative net losses to run, and that\u2019s kind of in the 2% to 2.5% range. And as I said, you can kind of -- the provision is a one year look forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with North Coast Research. John Healy : I wanted to ask a two-part question on financing. I appreciate the color you put in the release regarding the CAF Tier 2 and Tier 3 in terms of penetration. I was hoping you could comment on what the profile of those borrowers look like in terms of maybe the average credit score in Tier 2 and Tier 3 as well as CAF for the year in terms of originations made and maybe how that compares to what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. And then as a follow-up to that, I just kind of wanted to ask, just when you are making your assumptions for recoveries on the loans, originated in fiscal \u201817, how do those recovery amounts compare to the assumptions that you made on \u201815 and \u201816 recoveries, if you have $15,000 loan? Is it $7,500 you\u2019re expecting in recovery in the example that you talked about the past? Or is it 4% lower because you\u2019re expecting to use car market three years from now to be 4% lower than it was this year? Tom Reedy : Yeah, let me answer your second question first, and that is, there\u2019s not nearly that much precision around recoveries. As I mentioned I think a couple questions ago, we originate loans based on the knowledge that in the future we won\u2019t know what recoveries are and we have a range of recoveries that we\u2019ve experienced over time. And so we go into the equation contemplating a range of recoveries and hopefully it falls within that range. So there is really not much to be specific on that front. As far as the credit profile or the CAF customer versus Tier 2 versus Tier 3, in general they\u2019re going to -- CAF is going to be at the very highest level, because we take the first look and nothing goes down to Tier 2 or 3 until after we\u2019ve either declined them or asked for conditions on their financing. But CAF does if you look at our securitizations and we do lend across a pretty broad spectrum, our average FICO this quarter is 707 for the portfolio, but we do a lot of stuff higher than that and some stuff lower than that as well. So you -- I mean, you can get a flavor for that, but we do to a relatively broad spectrum of credit, but we\u2019re not looking only at FICO scores as the measure for whether we\u2019ll approve a person and what we\u2019ll charge them as far as rate. And so in Tier 2 and Tier 3, I guess, Tier 3 is what you would call deeper sub-prime. In general, that\u2019s going to be 550 and below. And then Tier 2 is kind of a gap in between, but it\u2019s very hard to give any specifics on that because everybody has got their own methodology that\u2019s why we have multiple lenders and various space to maximize the sales for CarMax. John Healy : Great. I appreciate that, and the reason I ask that is that I think there are so many different definitions of sub-prime, so many definitions of prime, and I just wanted to try to get an update on where those, so I appreciate that? Thank you. Tom Reedy : You\u2019re right, some people say sub-prime is below 630. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Brett Hoselton : Two questions that are related to one another, and again, financing is a popular topic here. First of all, your adjustments for provision. Was that more a change in your recovery expectations in terms of used car values? Or was it more in terms of default rates, that's question number one. Question number two, can you give us an update as to the sub-prime pilot? Tom Reedy : Sure. I'll start with the first one. As I mentioned when I described the allowance, it was a result of a change in the assumptions we used behind the scenes, I'm not going to go into detail on it, but it was -- we're using more recent data and weighting that heavier in the historical portion of what we utilized to build the allowance. Recovery rates, as I've said when we originate loans, we go into them knowing that there can be a range in the future when the loss may indeed happen, so we don't have any prescription what they're going to be. And your second question is on the Tier 3 test. I think it's steady as it goes. We're comfortable with the portfolio. It's not doing anything unexpected as far as its performance. And again, we're originating roughly 5% of the Tier 3 volume that CarMax does. So as the customer applicant flow increases and decreases, our volume of the Tier 3 will increase and decrease with it. We're not changing the way we approach it. And we're comfortable participating in this manner for the foreseeable future. We like, as we said it originally, we really are interested in learning more about the space. And even if it's just to have better information to manage our partners, I think it's helpful for us to have a toe in the water with this. Brett Hoselton : Is the pilot look large enough that you can take it to the securitization market at this point? Tom Reedy : Yes, we mentioned earlier in the year that we put a private securitizing structure in place to fund this business. If it were something that we decided to expand and continue for a longer period of time, we would also consider permanent funding, but as far as the public market at this point, I don't know. Brett Hoselton : And I apologize, just one more follow-on, which is can you talk about the spreads and so forth? Tom Reedy : Which spreads? Brett Hoselton : At that level of the market, the sub-prime pilot? Tom Reedy : What I can tell you is, it's a much higher APR and it's a much higher expected loss. I mean, you can kind of extrapolate from the data that we've given regarding the size of the allowance that this comprised of Tier 3 that we're expecting -- you expect roughly 10 times the losses in Tier 3 that you do it in CAF. Brett Hoselton : No, I apologize. I was actually thinking about the change versus maybe six months or a year ago? Tom Reedy : It's not material. Brett Hoselton : Okay, great, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Levin with Deutsche Bank. Michael Levin : So first off, looks like you did a very nice job in holding in your retail GPUs despite lower used values. Just wondering if you can kind of discuss how you think your ability will move from here with the expectation that lower used prices will continue to flow through the market. Is there some point at which we'll necessarily kind of take a step down in terms of those GPUs below $2,100? Or should we expect some kind of margin, percentage margin expansion back to kind of where you were a few years ago? Tom Reedy : Yes. So, obviously, the retail GPUs are important thing for us to focus on. We\u2019ve been focused on and we\u2019ll continue to focus on them. I think in my opening comments, I talked about the fact that we\u2019ve been able to maintain these $2,100 to $2,200 range for the last 24 consecutive quarters. During that time period, there have been lots of fluctuations in price. I would even go back to, if you think about the recession, when our average selling price went down by about 20%, we were still able to maintain GPUs during that time. So it\u2019s hard for me to say, I think of a situation we can\u2019t maintain the GPUs. Now that being said, we do constantly test to see if giving up GPU will drive more sales and does it make sense for the overall business. If we saw a scenario where that elasticity was different and benefited CarMax, we would certainly do that. We have not seen that, and we will continue to focus on hitting that target. Michael Levin : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just quickly on you\u2019ve been testing rate increases to kind of maintain your collateral spreads, but I\u2019m just wondering as we\u2019re expecting to see a higher mix of credit quality come into used vehicle market and you\u2019re going to get lower customer rates from then, is that going to kind of hamper your ability at all to raise customer rates overall with that mix of credit coming in? Bill Nash : I think as I said, during the quarter, we increased rates pretty much 50 basis points across the board. If you look now you see that the best rate that you can get at CarMax is about 2.45 versus 1.95 several months ago. And to answer your question, it really depends on what\u2019s coming through the door and what the market will bear. As I said, we\u2019ve got to provide competitive offers to what people can achieved outside the CarMax system for our customers in order to keep them happy. And as rates move, we\u2019re very cognizant down in Atlanta of the spread and maintaining profitability of CAF, and as we see things move, we\u2019ll constantly look for opportunities to optimize it. Michael Levin : I guess more of what I mean is, because your credit quality is increasing, does that necessarily mean that your collateral spreads will decrease because your customer rates are going to skew towards a lower number? Tom Reedy : As I said, it depends, it probably depends on a lot of factors. If you put that in isolation, the answer is yes, but you also expect some lower losses on that from that set of customers. Bill Nash : Well, I think to Tom\u2019s point also, it depends on what the competitive -- what the competition looks like as they move the rate for the higher tier customer as well. Tom Reedy : Yeah, I don\u2019t want to give any forward-looking, but you can hypothesize that as we get more and more high credit customers in there with lower loss expectations, we would see that all else equal, forgetting the changing environment, you would see the portfolio expected losses start to drift down, which means we might be leaving something on the table at the other end and we\u2019re constantly looking for pockets, as I said, for pockets where we can expand and contract as it makes sense. So we still do that to the greatest extent possible. Michael Levin : Perfect. And did you quantify how much of the increase in the loss reserves was attributable to the change in methodology? Tom Reedy : Virtually all of it. Michael Levin : Okay. Thank you. Tom Reedy : Let me clarify that too, the increase vis-\u00e0-vis Q3 from 1.10 to 1.16, not year-over-year. Obviously, we\u2019ve had negative loss experience during the course of the year that\u2019s incorporated that has already been built into that over the first three quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Faghri with Susquehanna. Ali Faghri : So on the same-store sales you've had a meaningful acceleration in recent quarters, despite the sizable drag from lower Tier 3 volumes. Could you remind us when you lap that headwind, and also help us quantify if there was an impact on your sales from delayed tax refunds in the quarter and maybe potentially whether you saw some of that pressure moderate as those refunds started to catch up at the end of February? Bill Nash : Yes, so on the first question, on when we lapped the Tier 3 headwind, that would be after the first quarter of this year. That's when we started seeing the tightening by the partners. Tom Reedy : So not yet. Bill Nash : So, yes, not yet. And then I'm sorry, what was your second question? Ali Faghri : What the impact of the delayed tax refunds were in the quarter, and whether you saw some improvement maybe at the end of the quarter as those started to flow back to the market? Bill Nash : It's really hard to quantify how much it impacted the quarter or the month. We do and I think Tom talked about in his introductory remarks that they are I said by the end of February, year-over-year there were probably about 10% less refunds. We think that it had an impact but it's really hard to quantify the degree. It's really not something over a longer period of time, it's really it all comes down in the wash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. James Albertine : Good morning and 48 minutes into a call, let me just say congratulations, which I think would be in order for 8.7% comp. Most retailers would kill for that right now, and I'm surprised we're not making a bigger deal about that, and we're having a CAF 101 lesson. So I would just make that statement. The question I had here is in the constitution of comp sales, we've talked in prior quarters about the fact that the supply of late model is littered with maybe more cars than the market's demanding and not enough trucks. Your comp sales surprised us turning to the positive, is that a reflection of a more balanced supply environment on the car and trucks side? And sort of related to that, trucks are going to be more expensive generally. And is there a way that you could sort of pivot even higher or at least resist the trend that the NABA is calling out with respect to broader used vehicle declines given the constitution of trucks in your mix? Tom Reedy : I think the fact that the inventory -- I think we had -- I think industry estimates are saying about 3 million cars -- incremental cars came off lease this past year. They're estimating another 3 million to 4 million next year. I think that availability of inventory certainly plays into or is a component as I said earlier, in our comp sales. There are a lot of things that I think play into the reason our comp sales are where they're today. Our average selling price this quarter was down, but it's a little bit of two-sided story. One, it was driven up by the fact that our mix in trucks, large SUVs, that went up a little bit, caused it to go up. But then, the overall acquisition price went down. So that offset any increase in that -- increase in the truck inventory. I think, as we go forward, I think it'll continue to be a positive for CarMax as far as whether a change is up the mix. I think the leasing date I think -- a lot of leases on trucks and large SUVs, so over time I would expect that to further back into the marketplace, and that could be some push to make average selling prices higher, but it remains to be seen. James Albertine : I'll leave it at that and maybe follow offline on some finance related questions, but congratulations again. You know just the ways that we are concerned the new vehicle sales have pulled forward used vehicle demand, you're going to have to flex margins per unit to reflect -- to sort of combat that. Clearly the fourth quarter I think represents otherwise, so really congratulations there and best of luck in the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King. Bill Armstrong : So we've been hearing a lot about consumers with negative equity in their trade-ins, and I was wondering if you can maybe discuss if you're seeing that trend with the customers coming into your stores and to what extent that might influence your ability to offer them financing, any influence on loan-to-value ratios? And in general, how that might be affecting your business overall? Tom Reedy : Yes, Bill, I would just tell you we haven't seen anything that's worth mentioning. It just hasn't played out to any type of meaningful impact for us at this point. Bill Armstrong : Would you see it maybe more on the lower end of the credit spectrum versus maybe your higher end? Tom Reedy : I would be speculating. Like I said, I think overall for us, we haven't seen -- it just hadn't been an issue for us. So I can't really say if it's a little bit more impactful on the lower end or the higher end. It's just overall hasn't been meaningful number for us at all. Bill Nash : As we've mentioned Bill, the theme throughout the year has been really one of volume of credit apps at that lower end not showing up as much. Or at least not pulling the trigger on applying for credit so it's hard to define what's the driver of that. It could be that they do have more negative equity on a less comp and therefore not coming in the plan, but that would be a hypothesis. Bill Armstrong : Right, okay. Makes sense. And just a quick follow-up, your tax rate was a little bit lower, your effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. Anything to call out there? And what should we be maybe modeling going forward in terms of the tax rate? Tom Reedy : Yes, I am glad you asked that. There's a couple of things to comment on there and probably the go forward one is the bigger issue. At any given period, state tax items can cause the rate to move in, particularly year-end when you're truing up. And this year, we had a number of things fall favorably from that perspective on the true ups. We also as required reserve for uncertain tax positions, and from time to time these positions become certain whether it's because of their resolved or their statue limitations goes away, and this year we had a number of items that timed out from that perspective as well. So there are some favorability on state side that caused the change in rate. On a go forward basis, I think because of the [indiscernible] guidance regarding stock-based compensation, which I'm sure many of you are familiar with, that new treatment is likely to cause significant volatility in effective tax rate and then consequently net income versus pretax income. And then you can go look at the guidance yourself. In effect with it on a go forward basis, tax benefits or deficiencies from option exercises will now flow through the income statement in the tax line rather than flowing through the balance sheet in equity. What that means is in any given year, changes in stock price, changes in option exercise behavior will have an impact on your tax rate and just insert other potentially significant level of volatility in that tax rate and then like I said consequently net income. So good stuff happened. This year going forward it's very hard to give you any kind of guidance what the tax rate would be. Bill Armstrong : Right. But that wouldn\u2019t change the actual cash tax you\u2019re paying? But this is just --. Tom Reedy : Not at all. Yeah, this is just the kind of reflection of where that tax shield or cost runs through. But it definitely will impact reported net income and EPS, so you may want to consider that if you think about things. Bill Armstrong : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Nic Zangler : This is Nic Zangler on for Rick. Just digging into that same-store sales number, you guys are obviously thinking strong unit sales and this is something despite the credit tightening in Tier 3 lenders. But to be clear on the dynamics, if not for the tightening of the Tier 3 lenders, would total company same-store sales be stronger and therefore you\u2019re currently missing sales? Or are those sales being picked up by CAF or more likely the Tier 2 lenders or even outside financing, which would than obviously contributes to that 15.3% accounts report exclusive of the Tier 3? Bill Nash : Yeah, it\u2019s hard -- it will be hard to say for sure. But in an all-equal environment, I think if we had not seen such a decrease in the Tier 3, same-store sales could have been higher. But keep in mind as far as other people picking these up, what we\u2019ve talked about even today and previous this year is a lot of that is driven by the fact that customers just aren\u2019t coming in the door. So it\u2019s not like they\u2019re coming in the door and we\u2019re not getting them and somebody else is getting. We\u2019re just not seeing them. And the dynamics that Tom just spoke to a little bit, but really is the hypothesis on our side as far as why they\u2019re not coming in. So whether that is not going to other people. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case. I think we\u2019ve seen industry numbers that support that this is our phenomena that goes beyond CarMax. Tom Reedy : Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little bit of color there with regard to Tier 2 and Tier 3 phenomenon. There\u2019s clearly, as we\u2019ve said, a decline in the number of applicants in that at that very low end. But I think our Tier 2 partners are doing a great job in their approach to credit and a small portion or some portion of the decline in Tier 3 may have been picked up by Tier 2. But it\u2019s impossible to say what. Bill Nash : Yeah, let\u2019s not forget, I mean, while we\u2019re having at the Tier 3 sales, they\u2019re also our least profitable sales. And the fact that our core business is growing at such a good rate, those are way more profitable sales for us, so we\u2019re very pleased with that. Nic Zangler : Understood and then there\u2019s also been some discussions around or within automotive retail some weakness in some markets due to immigration concerns given the rhetoric that's coming out of DC. I\u2019m curious if you saw this play out at all in the fourth quarter? Or if you\u2019re seeing anything related to that early in the first? Bill Nash : Yeah, not. I mean, there\u2019s really nothing to comment there for us. Tom Reedy : And we don\u2019t get into market-specific dynamics. Nic Zangler : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with MorningStar. David Whiston : Just want to go back to pricing first, kind of open-ended question for you, just generally speaking, 30,000 feet level. Why shouldn\u2019t shareholders be very worried about this? Is it just a matter of getting a better SG&A leverage than your competitors? Bill Nash : Are you talking about our margin? David Whiston : Yeah, just the decline on the overall market on used vehicle prices going down, balancing GPU and SG&A leverage. Bill Nash : Yeah, average selling prices. We don\u2019t -- I mean, we target the GPU as average selling prices go down, we can still maintain GPUs and pass those savings along to customers. And as I spoke to earlier, we demonstrated this in multiple periods when there's been the high fluctuation in pricing. So, and then on top of that, we'll continue as an organization to look at opportunities to take cost out of the system, but through cost of goods sold and through SG&A. And when you take cost of goods sold down, you have the option of passing that along in the form of lower prices or you could take some of that to margin, and we will look at that as we continue to make progress. David Whiston : And on digital, did I hear right that non-CarMax searches, those people have effectively doubled in those people going to your site, is that right? Bill Nash : Yes, so non-brand, so searches that folks do that don't include CarMax, since June since we brought up the website, those searches are more than doubled. And that's important because we already do well on the CarMax brand when people search that, but it's important because a lot of folks will start their search with things like Honda Accord or Honda or Accord, which don't speak to CarMax. So making progress on that we feel is a very good thing because that's the way most people search and we feel like we've a lot of upside and a lot of work we can still to do to get better at that. David Whiston : And not being a web advertising expert, can you briefly talk about how you can do that beyond just spending more with Google to be higher up in the search results? Bill Nash : Well, remember, what we're talking about is SEO, search engine optimization versus search engine marketing. Search engine marketing is what you pay for the ads. Search engine optimization, the way you -- it's not necessary that you're paying for ads. The way we do it is, through this year, we've done a couple different things. One, it started with the website. Since the new website, we've also redesigned how the search engines crawl our website and make it so it's more efficient for them to crawl. We focus on keywords, again keywords that aren't related to CarMax, and building up pages and so that when the search engines search your website, they see keywords and like, okay, CarMax must be an expert on that, so we're going to bring them into the organic search. Content, that's another way we've increased our SEO, building relevant content that again when the search engines look at your website, it's relevant to the questions that people are asking. So those are the levers that we pulled in and we will continue to pull to get the SEO or the organic search going for our customers. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Sort of a clerical question, given that new, the financing mix been provided on the call, on the press release, is that 18.2 for Tier 2? Is that comparable to the 15.7 you reported last quarter? Tom Reedy : Last year we [Multiple Speakers] Yes, there's a little disconnect there. So it is not quite consistent with the 15 reported last year. We have some other programs that are higher credit, referral type programs that are not CAF. Definitely trying to cue [ph] on our CAF. We've now bucketed them with Tier 2, that represented about 1.5%, so that's the disconnect. Christopher Bottiglieri : So if I take the last year's cadence with 17.4 -- I mean, in '16 -- 17.4 in '16 [ph] to 15.7, and now, 18.2. You're standing to justify your three quarters with the new methodology? Tom Reedy : The 18.2 includes about 1.5 that the others don't. Christopher Bottiglieri : So the first three quarters don't include that 1.5? Tom Reedy : Right. Christopher Bottiglieri : Okay. And then what -- why is other picking up so much? Like, what's the take away there and how to interpret that? Tom Reedy : I think in general, people with higher credit and more wherewithal to get funding migrate more to others. So people -- that's credit unions and that\u2019s also people with cash. So as we -- it's not surprising, as we've seen double-digit growth at the very highest end of the credit spectrum, kind of the 700, 750 and above, and shrinkage at the very lowest end to assume that some of that's just flow that higher credit people who have access to other funding are buying more cars. Christopher Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then a follow-up on the financing next year, so you added a nice new disclosure to your securitization, where you give the mix FICO score. It only goes back to 2012, though. Can you give us a sense to what you're mix of stores sub 630 were back in like 2006, 2007 if we compare to where you are versus last cycle? Tom Reedy : That's some really old data that I don't -- I can't put my fingers on. If you go -- you can get an idea for it. But what I can say is the spectrum of credits that we lend to has not changed dramatically over time, and there's fine-tuning here and there. During the recession and into kind of 2010 time period, we significantly dialed back on what we're doing to ensure that we have a highly finance of portfolio, and we were successful at having our partner step up and taking more volume. From 2011 kind of forward, we've been moving back to what we've historically done. I can give you that color, but as far as details, not really. Christopher Bottiglieri : Just one last one and maybe just from memory here. Is there may be like a basis points what I can plot your mix by APR, say, 1,000 basis points granted through your treasury to get to what that mix might have been. Is that a fair way of looking at it? Tom Reedy : I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question. Christopher Bottiglieri : If I was to look at your mix by APRs historically, what do you think the appropriate risk spread is for the treasury rate for sub-prime, what you would charge your customers over time [Multiple Speakers]? Tom Reedy : That's going to depend on the environment. We're always fine-tuning. We don't talk about that kind of detail. Christopher Bottiglieri : Okay, that's fair, alright thank you for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Linda Adefioye : This is Linda in for Adam, thank you for taking our question. So there's a thesis out there that your GPU is not sensitive to a decline and used car pricing and that you can manage to a dollar value per unit on used cars regardless of what your used HP is, do you subscribe to that view? Bill Nash : Yes, that is the view out there, and actually, that's what we've demonstrated of being able to do for many years now. Linda Adefioye : Okay. And now do you think the credit worthiness and financial strength of your used car customers is in any way impacted by potential decline in used car values? Bill Nash : Do I think the used car prices -- the used car price decline? Linda Adefioye : The creditworthiness and -- yes, and financial strength of your used car customers? Tom Reedy : We have no way of knowing if those are correlated or not. Linda Adefioye : Okay and finally, is your business sensitive to the credit worthiness of your customers? Bill Nash : Well, I can address that. I mean there -- we strive to have a credit offering for customers across the spectrum and as we've talked about many times before, CarMax Auto Finance participates at the higher end of that credit rate, and we take a look at everything. If we don\u2019t approve, we pass it down and we have a pool of very strong, very savvy Tier 2 lenders that all take a look at those customers and compete for it. And we think having a portfolio of those lenders add sales and benefit to CarMax, and then we have a Tier 3 offering. So we attempt to have a finance offering in place for any customer that would come through the door so as to insulate ourselves from those kinds of changes. That said, as Bill mentioned earlier, higher credit quality customers tend to convert more readily than low credit quality customers perhaps just because by virtue of the fact that the offers they are getting a more attractive. The Tier 3 offers are typically less attractive. So it\u2019s, like I said, it\u2019s impossible to correlate these two things, but we think we do everything we can to manage in whatever environment we are at. Operator : That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you, Victoria. Just a couple of things. One, if you didn\u2019t get to ask the call, please feel free to call -- yes, if you didn\u2019t get to ask a question during the call, please feel free to call IR, to call Kathryn, and we\u2019ll talk to you off-line. I also just wanted to -- given the nature of the questions this whole session on Auto Finance, I just really want to reiterate Tom, one of Tom\u2019s early statement, which is, like the rest of the business we've consistently demonstrated CAF can be nimble and react to different changes in market conditions. We feel good about the lifetime loss we\u2019re shorting for at this point, and so we feel good about the CAF business. I want to thank all of you for joining the call and your interest in CarMax today. I also especially want to thank our associates nationwide who are continuing to work hard to deliver the incredible customer experience every day. We were recently honored as a Fortune 100 best companies to work for on that list for the 13th year in a year. That is absolutely a testament to our associates. They are out there driving what\u2019s possible every day for each other, for the customers, for the communities. They are CarMax, they are a differentiator. I\u2019m proud of their accomplishments. I'm proud to work beside them, and I look forward to a great new year. Talk to you next quarter. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2018 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, Victoria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings conference call. With me as usual are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the Company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections or other forward-looking statements, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, filed with the SEC. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me thank you in advance for asking just one question and a follow-up before getting back in the queue. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong start to fiscal 2018. I will begin today with the highlights of the first quarter and then ask Tom to review financing. Then, I\u2019ll come back and comment on our initiatives. Our used unit comps for the first quarter increased by 8.2% and total used units grew by 14.1%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion while store traffic was flat. Strong sales results continue to be supported by a number of factors including our continued focus on execution and the impact of our initiatives to enhance the customer experience. While we believe there was some benefit from the delay in the tax refund season, we are pleased to have exceeded 8% used unit comps in both this quarter and last quarter. Additionally, as more vehicles come off lease and as acquisition prices decrease, we believe it is beneficial to sales as cars become more affordable. Website traffic grew 9%, which generated significantly more leads than a year ago; this reflects our continued focus on the digital experience, both with the website and online functionality. Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at $2,212 compared to $2,002 in the first quarter of last year. Compared to last year\u2019s first quarter, our wholesale units were flat. The growth in our store base was offset by lower appraisal traffic.  As we discussed in previous quarters, we continue to see a supply -- a lower supply of older, 7 to 9 year old vehicles that correlate to the years of decline in industry new vehicles sales during the recession. Gross profit per wholesale unit increased to $1,012 compared to $995 in the last year\u2019s first quarter. We believe this increase was supported by the delay in tax refunds. A few of the topics, then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, 0 to 4-year old vehicles increased over 78% versus more than 76% in last year\u2019s first quarter. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks rose to 27% in this first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter but about 3 percentage points higher than last year. On SG&A, expenses for the first quarter increased 6% to $404 million. This was primarily due to several factors, the 11% or 18 store increase in our base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year; higher variable costs due to increased sales and spending related to our strategic initiatives. These were partially offset by an $11.5 million decrease in share-based compensation expense. While we reported $157 per unit in SG&A leverage, approximately $80 came from share-based compensation expense. In addition, we saw some timing favorability from planned initiative and marketing spend. Taking into consideration these timing items, we still leveraged SG&A modestly, reflecting the continued investment in strategic initiatives that we previously discussed. During the first quarter, we opened three stores including our first two in Seattle and one in Pensacola, Florida. During the second quarter, we will open three stores, one in Hartford, which we opened earlier this month, another in San Francisco and one in Salisbury, Maryland. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Last year, we talked about seeing an increase in credit applications from the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decrease in applications from the lower end, which was consistent throughout the year. In the first quarter, we began seeing application growth all across the credit spectrum. CAF net penetration was 42%, compared to 44% in last year\u2019s first quarter. CAF penetration levels in FY17, remember, were at historically high levels. We continue to see solid performance by our partners. Tier 2 penetration grew to 19% versus 18.5% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Third-party Tier 3 sales mix was 10% of used unit sales compared to 11.2% for the same period last year. As we talked about in the press release, the Tier 3 headwind was less than we\u2019ve experienced in recent quarters, as the tightening we observed last year occurred in the middle of Q1. In addition, we again saw growth in sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. Going back to CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This was due to CarMax\u2019s sales growth, but partially offset by the lower penetration and a drop in average amounts financed. CAF income increased 8.5% to $109.4 million as the 11% growth in average managed receivables was partially offset by a slight compression in the portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.8% of average managed receivables; this compared to 5.9% in the first quarter of last year and 5.7% in most recent quarter. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.8% compared to 7.5% a year ago, and 7.4% in the fourth quarter. The ending allowance for loan losses at about $130 million was 1.18% of ending managed receivables, up from 1.05% in first quarter of last year, but similar to our 1.16% we saw in the fourth quarter. This quarter\u2019s loss experience was in line with our expectations at the end of Q4. Turning over to capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased over 3 million shares for $182 million. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. Now, I\u2019m going to take a moment to provide update on a few of our strategic initiatives. A number of you have already had the opportunity to visit CarMax\u2019s digital and technology innovation center in downtown Richmond. When you were there, you learned that we are focused on leveraging lean product development, best practices for our consumer innovations. This quarter, we unified our product teams into a new product department in order to further align the work of these teams and to continue to leverage rapid product innovation as a key competitive advantage. One example of our product innovation is the progress we\u2019re making in digital merchandising, which is how we showcase our vehicles on carmax.com. We\u2019ve already achieved significant success through the use of indoor photo studios. These studios allow us to eliminate the impact of weather and guarantee we secure a consistent top quality photo of all our vehicles. Today, we\u2019ve opened 16 indoor studios across the country and plan to open another 18 this fiscal year. Regarding online financing, which has been available in all of our stores for two full quarters, we continue to be pleased with the results. Customers are engaging well with this offering and it continues to contribute to increased lease which we believe ultimately generate incremental sales. Now, we\u2019re focused on improving the experience and proactively marketing our online financing capability nationwide. Last quarter, I mentioned the tests we are conducting in Charlotte of our new online appraisal offering. This is a tool that allows our customers to receive an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting information online. We\u2019re receiving great feedback from both our customers and sales team and are planning to expand the test to two more stores in Charlotte next quarter. Lastly, we continue to focus on learning how we can deliver CarMax\u2019s hallmark, exceptional experience to customers wherever and whenever they want to shop. We continue our home delivery test and one key learning we found is that human intervention at the right time is important to giving our customers the personalized experience they expect. Our goal with this test is to build the functionality needed to fully integrate our online and in-store experiences that we can offer as much or as little the car buying process online as each customer wants. As you can tell, it is exciting time here and we\u2019ve got a lot going on. We remain confident that all of our initiatives, both online and in-store will ensure CarMax continues to lead the industry and deliver and exceptional car buying experience. Now, I\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Victoria? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So, it looks like loss rates and CAF were better than expected after a couple of quarters of let\u2019s call it, underperformance. Can you provide any more color on what you\u2019re seeing on that front, especially following the catch-up we had in the fourth quarter? Number one. And then number two, what you\u2019re seeing in recovery rates, given the ongoing decline we\u2019re seeing in used vehicle values? Tom Reedy : Yes. Scot, I would I guess not agree that losses were better than expected. As a mentioned in my remarks, losses for the quarter came in pretty much in line with where we had booked them at the end of Q4. So, last year was a period of continuing underperformance from a loss perspective and we are making adjustments based on missed versus what we had booked and making adjustments to the allowance based on what we\u2019re learning. This quarter is pretty much a straight forward quarter for CAF at this point. We saw growth in the receivables, a little bit less growth in net income margin because of the compression we\u2019ve seen, and not a lot to talk about from a loss perspective. So, you\u2019d expect just to grow income a little bit. With regard to recovery rates, we\u2019re seeing that trend down a little bit year-over-year about a couple of percentage points but not materially different. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. I\u2019ll get back in line for my next question. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : My first question relates to SG&A, specifically, compensation. Even when you back out stock comp in both years, your compensation for vehicle retail, which is the way we tend to look at it, was down, I think 4%. I guess that\u2019s consistent with where it was for the past few quarters, certainly better than we had thought. Is this a function of simply leveraging fixed costs and what kind of comp do you need you think to leverage that number, particularly as the compares on that line item are getting a bit stiffer? Tom Reedy : Hey, Matt. This is Tom. I think what you\u2019re seeing is we had a pretty significant comp quarter. I mean compensation is both, variable from selling more cars, but there is also a fixed element that we would expect to leverage as we sell more cars, and I think that\u2019s probably what you\u2019re seeing in this quarter. As far as, where we expect to leverage, as Bill mentioned in his remarks, still kind of the higher end of that middle single-digit range is where we\u2019d expect given all the investments we\u2019re making in both technologies, systems and improving our customer experience. Matt Fassler : Thanks. I will ask the follow-up, I\u2019ll kick you up on that, which relates to the comment that Tom made about seeing application growth across the credit spectrum. Clearly that should be good for sales. What does that say about the risk profile of the incremental loans that CAF will be extended? Does the loan simply go where they would go? In other words, if people are coming on the lower end, they\u2019ll go more to Tier 3 or to Tier 2 and CAF will do what it\u2019s always done or does this to satisfy that demand do you all need to anymore risk on the credit side for CAF in particular? Tom Reedy : I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to start talking about taking any more risks on CAF. As we talked about last quarter, we enacted some tightening. But pretty much, what flows to CAF, what flows to Tier 2 and Tier 3 is going to be based on what comes through the door. And as we\u2019ve all talked about, look at Tier 3 business as incremental. Obviously, it\u2019s more -- it\u2019s less profitable and more volatile. But on ongoing basis, it would do very little to what CAF is going to be, just maybe it will have an impact on the mix of penetration between the various players. Matt Fassler : And are your partners Tier 2 and Tier 2 receptive to this traffic? Tom Reedy : Absolutely, I think, we\u2019ve talked about before that we believe we have the best channel for originating used car loans. I don\u2019t think any of our partners would disagree with that. As far as performance in the quarter, we continue to be happy with how they\u2019re performing. Tier 2 lenders, we look at collectively, because all of them see every customer and they\u2019re able to make a competitive offer. As you saw, they\u2019re up about half a point year-over-year in the quarter. So we\u2019re happy with the conversion we\u2019re seeing out of that group. Tier 3, as we mentioned, we saw some tightening in Q1 of last year, but relatively consistent performance. Since then and the way we measure performances, how many sales that we get out of the applications that they see. So, nothing except good things to report on that front. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. I have two, I think easy questions. So, I\u2019m going to bend Katharine\u2019s rules if that\u2019s okay. I guess, the first one was on wholesale profit per car, it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s been up in a while. And I read the press release and it sounds like it might be an anomaly and it will be a little bit more normal going forward, I just wanted to clarify that. And then secondarily on subprime, as you lap the tightening, I guess, I\u2019m just wondering going forward should we expect kind of stable year-over-year subprime? Is that a benefit to same-store sales going forward? It seems to somewhat of a hindrance over the past year. If you could give us some color and your thoughts on that? Bill Nash : Sure, Sharon. On the first question, the wholesale profit per unit. You\u2019re right, it has -- it did buck the trends this quarter. As we cited earlier, as I talked about in my statements earlier, I think there was some benefit from the delay in refunds, which we actually talked about a little bit in the fourth quarter that we thought it was going to be a little bit of that. So as far as where does it go from here, I mean, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. But again, I think the real reason is that, we had some folks that had tax refund monies that rolled into this quarter. As far as the subprime and lapping and where that\u2019s going, it\u2019s really hard to tell where that\u2019s going to normalize. And so being able to project forward, if some percent of where we\u2019re going to be, I think would be a little dangerous at this point. Tom Reedy : Yes. I think little clear, last year, as we talked about, we were seeing a headwind from both credit policy at the partners and a reduction in volume of customer applications both. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve pretty consistent behavior from the partners. On a go forward basis, we have no way of knowing what could change on that front. But assuming nothing would change, it\u2019s going to be dependent on the volume of customers coming through door. We\u2019ll see how that plays out over the course of the year. Bill Nash : But we\u2019re still really pleased with the first quarter as far as when you look at the comps, our non-Tier 3 customers, was about 10%. And keep in mind that those are the most profitable customers we have. So, we are pleased with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The topic is sourcing. There is a huge influx of off lease cars coming, as you know. And these should be ideal CarMax cars. But since they\u2019re often grounded at franchise dealers, they could be tougher for you to access. So, my question is, what are you doing on the sourcing front to ensure you get your hands on these cars, especially knowing that it\u2019s more profitable, if you don\u2019t have to rely entirely on auctions to source those cars? Bill Nash : Yes, Craig. So, first of all, I\u2019d say you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve already seen some of the influx of off lease vehicles coming. As far as it being tougher, there are so many cars that I think have come in and will continue to come into the market that I don\u2019t see that as a challenge. And as more of them come in, the prices will continue to drop. And so when we can buy them offsite, they are that much more affordable for our customers. So, we don\u2019t see the sourcing as an issue being able to get those vehicles. We think we\u2019ll be able to get them and then we also think that they will continue to go down in price which will help on pricing. Craig Kennison : So, as a follow-up, is your mix of, call is self-sourcing for off lease cars, any different than your mix of other types of cars? Bill Nash : Yes. So, the self sufficiency is what you\u2019re talking about and which is how we view the appraisal and we typically are in a range of 40% to 50%. This quarter we are slightly under that. I think it\u2019s more of a factor of the 14% increase in total sales. Operator : The next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. James Albertine : Great. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a solid quarter. I wanted to ask on extended protection plans. It just seems like the attachment rate may have improved to your -- relative to prior quarters. And given your comments on the 0 to 4-year old vehicle penetration increasing year-over-year, wondering if that\u2019s having a positive impact that we may see carry through the balance of the year? Thanks. Tom Reedy : Sure. This is Tom. I\u2019ll start with the extended protection plans that you asked. As you saw, it was up about 16 million year-over-year; just two things going on there. One is, we did have a favorable adjustment, a modest favorable adjustment on the return reserve, which is obviously going to be something that\u2019s in the mix. Penetration was actually pretty consistent with last year but we did see some improvement in pricing with some actions we took during the last fiscal year. So, that supported a little bit as well, but penetration was relatively consistent. Bill Nash : Yes. And I wouldn\u2019t see -- the 0 to 4 change or anything, I wouldn\u2019t see that necessarily changing it. We don\u2019t believe that will necessarily change that penetration in the near-term? James Albertine : So, there is nothing in the data that suggests that you\u2019re more likely to sell an EPP on a one-year old to two-year-old vehicle versus a six or seven-year old vehicle? Tom Reedy : We don\u2019t have that -- I mean, that would be a reasonable thing to assume, but we\u2019d have to dig in; we don\u2019t have it in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Aileen Smith : Good morning, guys. This is Aileen Smith on for John. Just a follow-up question to the vehicle sourcing you discussed earlier. Can you talk about the mix of vehicles that you\u2019re procuring for inventory now versus a year two ago? I think in the past, you faced some issues of procuring truck and SUV inventory at attractive price point. Is that headwind abated or is there still some further room for improvement in the coming years, especially as the mix of vehicles coming off lease and churning in the used vehicle market better matches than new vehicle market in recent years? Bill Nash : Sure. I mean, as I talked about earlier, our percent of sales of large and medium SUVs and trucks did rise to 27%, which was similar to the fourth quarter, but was about 3 percentage points higher than last year. And I would tell you, like we talked about last year. We\u2019re going to sell what customers are interested in buying. So, even last year when we were a little bit lower on large SUVs and trucks, we were still putting out there what folks wanted to buy and were also a good deal for them. So, what I would tell you is, I think certainly the supply has increased on these vehicles and has driven price down somewhat. But again, we\u2019re going to buy what the consumers want. Aileen Smith : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, what is the mix of crossovers in that as well? Bill Nash : Crossover vehicles? Aileen Smith : Yes. Bill Nash : Yes. I don\u2019t think -- the crossovers are not in that number. We don\u2019t keep those in that number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore ISI. Mike Montani : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to flush out a little bit the online appraisal initiatives that you all have working. I think in the past, you\u2019d mentioned like high-90% kind of success rate with that? And really, just tie that back into sourcing, because my understanding is that it\u2019s much more profitable for you all to sell the unit that you sourced through the appraisal lane versus the auction. Can you just provide some figures around that latter comment and how, if online appraisal works that might influence the mix of sourcing going forward? Bill Nash : Yes. I\u2019m not sure the comment about the 90%. As far as the online test, like I said, we got it in one market. This is where we will actually give the customer a value for their vehicle versus a range. We\u2019ll give them a value. We see this is an extension of our overall customer experience. There may be some customers that are interested in getting that value before coming into the store and we want to be sure that we can accommodate it. To your question about internal souring through appraisal lane versus sourcing all sites, you\u2019re right. We have talked about that in the past. If we can buy through our appraisal lane, it is a more profitable unit than buying it offsite. So, we\u2019re always trying to drive, as much as possible through the appraisal lane. But I will also tell you, even given this quarter where we relied a little bit more on offsite purchases, because the volume that we moved, we\u2019re still able to maintain GPU. Mike Montani : Okay, great. And the follow-up I had was on another digital initiative, which was home delivery. Just wondering, if you can share any learnings there, both from a standpoint of customer satisfaction with that initiative; and then secondly, profitability there, what you\u2019re seeing for long-term viability? Bill Nash : Yes. I think it\u2019s a little too early to talk about the profitability piece of it. Keep in mind, as I talked about in my remarks, we\u2019re really trying to make sure that we have a suite of e-commerce applications that enhanced the customer\u2019s experience, so that we can meet the customer wherever they want to be met. As I talked about earlier, one thing that we continue to be seeing and this has been reinforced is that in a lot of cases, customers do want some human interaction. Now, it may mean that they want to come into the store, they mean that they want to talk to somebody on the phone. But regardless, because of the complexity of the transaction, consumers, the majority of consumers, to enhance their experience, generally you have to have some type of customer interaction with them. So, we\u2019ll continue to develop this product offering. But again, it\u2019s really a series of a bunch of different things whether it\u2019s online financing, whether it\u2019s online appraisals, whether it\u2019s delivering the cars to house, kind of coming altogether and giving the customer the best experience possible. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Levin with Deutsche Bank. Michael Levin : I wanted to see if you could dig into the ASPs of the mix a little bit more when you are talking about higher portion of trucks and SUVs and more 0 to 4 year old vehicles and we\u2019ve kind of seen that play out. And price indices at Manheim and ADESA and Edmunds showing higher ASPs you but you guys are still kind of down a little bit. I wonder if you could just kind of talk about what might be happening there. Bill Nash : Yes. So, I think you\u2019ve highlighted a lot of the points there, Mike. Given the shift in mix on trucks and large SUVs, you\u2019d expect our ASP to go up a little bit. Given the tick up in zero to fours, that would be another factor that would cause ASPs to go up. But I\u2019ll tell you, they are being offset by the acquisition prices that we\u2019re paying. And what I would tell you is I think this speaks to the execution that the stores are doing and the great job that our buyers do, making sure that we\u2019re getting the best priced vehicles. And really at the end of day, that\u2019s really where it starts. You\u2019ve got to buy the vehicles at the right price. So, lower acquisition price is more than offsetting the increase that you normally would see from the mix shift. Michael Levin : Got it, great. So, it\u2019s just an execution point there. Just on a follow-up, can you kind of update on where you are in terms of online financing, where you are in that process and how you might be kind of progressing towards somebody having the ability to complete the entire transaction online in a very fast manner? Bill Nash : Yes. So, on the online financing, like I talked about earlier, it\u2019s been in place for two full quarters. We are excited about the response from the customers. They are engaging with it. Like I said, it\u2019s generating incremental lead. I think our path at this point is to continue to make that product and that experience continue to optimize that and make sure that we\u2019re tailoring it specifically for different customers. So, we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ll continue to look at advertising more nationally. Right now, you hit it if you go to our website. And like I talked about with the home delivery earlier, this is one component of home delivery. And we do think, I personally believe that consumers want to do more of the transaction online. And to the point that we can make that as easy as possible, speed up the transaction when they come into the store, that much quicker transaction, then that\u2019s a good thing for the customer, as far as being able to do it all online, that\u2019s our home delivery test, we\u2019ve got that in a market right now and we\u2019ll continue to improve that experience. Michael Levin : Are you expecting to bring that functionality to the wider online financing capability? Bill Nash : Well, the online financing capability is already a part of the home delivery. As far as are we planning on expanding home delivery that we\u2019re evaluating different options right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My question is around traffic. You talked about flat in-store traffic, but you saw a nice acceleration in website traffic, up 9% in the quarter; that\u2019s a big improvement. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that, whether it\u2019s sustainable? And as a related question, can you quantify the increase in leads that you\u2019re seeing? Bill Nash : Yes. So, on the traffic piece, remember, I\u2019ve talked about this in previous calls. I think from a traffic standpoint, we have to get away from thinking about just store traffic. And we need to be thinking about store traffic and web traffic and web leads. It\u2019s a more holistic view, because what we\u2019re going after here are comps. And whether we get the comps, because people are coming to the door initially or starting with us online, I think both are equally important. But store traffic is flat, but we\u2019re hitting more qualified folks in the door, that converts to more sale. So, as far as the uptick in the traffic, we\u2019re starting to cycle the new website. So, we can actually have apples-to-apples comparison. You\u2019re comparing against the same website a year ago, which part of that is the water is a little bit muddy. So, we\u2019re pleased with the 9%, but I would tell you, we\u2019re equally pleased with the growth that we have in leads and that\u2019s been a big focus for us, because leads are something that we can execute on. So, that\u2019s been growing rapidly as well. So that\u2019s we\u2019re equally pleased with that. And then what was the other question you asked? Seth Basham : It\u2019s just that, in terms of leads. Can you quantify that increase in leads you\u2019re seeing, even just a range, how much higher than the increased website traffic? Bill Nash : Yes. So, in the leads, we\u2019re seeing double-digit increases and we\u2019ve seen that for a period of time now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : [Indiscernible] CAF originations that was 7.8% this quarter, 7.4% last quarter, 7.5% a year ago. Is this due to the originations shifting down in the credit spectrum? Are you in fact getting improved pricing loans of similar quality? Bill Nash : Rick, as we mentioned last quarter, I think in the prepared remarks and question, but we talked about pretty much raising -- raised 50 basis points across the board last quarter. And so, you\u2019re going to step -- it\u2019s a result of that and it\u2019s a result of the mix of this coming through the door. But we\u2019ve definitely increased our rates. And we\u2019ll continue to watch the market, continue to watch funding costs. We look at it every week, and we\u2019ll continue to test as we see changes in that to try and preserve the margin. And we\u2019ll do whatever the market will allows us to do, as I\u2019ve said many times before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, everyone. Just as a follow-up to that. So, your declines in your net interest margin have been slowing down and it looks like it actually increased slightly on a sequential basis. Is that mostly result of these higher rates that you\u2019re now charging to consumers or how should we think about that going forward? Is that net interest margin, something that maybe starting to stabilize now? Tom Reedy : I think what you\u2019ll need to do is if you take a look at our public securitizations and you can see what\u2019s actually happening in those deals on a go forward basis. And then, I\u2019d like you to draw your own conclusion about what will happen going forward. As far the impact of recent changes, the net interest margin on portfolio is on the entire portfolio and so the newer originations are only a subset of that. It\u2019s a result of lot of different things and there is things paying down, there is a new stuff going in and there is lots of expenses as well. But I think you\u2019re right in observing that it\u2019s been relatively consistent for the past few quarters. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the early ship of the new vehicle market and given you\u2019re really nice comps this quarter, is that fair to say that excessive discounting on the new side from franchise dealers is not hurting your traffic? Bill Nash : When you think about the new vehicles and the SAAR rate, I think there is a lot of -- there is times when we\u2019re going to attract up or down but I think it\u2019s more in regards to the extreme. So, if you see a big decrease in SAAR, a rapid decrease in SAAR, or rapid increase in the new car sales rate, you see directionally how that may impact it. But I think if you see a more stable SAAR, or even a slightly declining SAAR, I think we\u2019ve proven over time through performance that we\u2019ve been able to successfully navigate those waters and have had some very good quarters in the past. So, as far as specifically with what we\u2019re seeing in leases, I mean obviously last quarter 8% comp, this quarter 8% comp, total sales more than 14%, it doesn\u2019t seem like leasing is having a big impact or the incentives. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks everybody, just one question and one follow up. First, for your sales that involve used car trade-ins, can you tell us what percentage of these trade-ins might be upside down or loans and kind of how that looks versus history in your trends? Bill Nash : Yes. I think it\u2019s pretty similar. We haven\u2019t seen a big -- we really haven\u2019t seen any real increase and negative equity for CAF what we\u2019ve been financing. So, it\u2019s been pretty much -- it\u2019s been very stable on the loan to value in our portfolio and what we\u2019re financing\u2026 Adam Jonas : But you don\u2019t disclose that percentage? Bill Nash : I believe it\u2019s in the Q. It\u2019s in the Q. Adam Jonas : Thank you. All right. Follow-up then, many auto companies and suppliers are arguing that the car is undergoing unprecedented technological change in terms of -- especially in terms of safety. And I understand historically there is now discernible link between tech and used prices historically but was wondering the management team\u2019s position, Bill and Tom. Do you think that this time could be different given the pace of the change to prepare for that? Bill Nash : Yes. I think there have been a lot of technology improvements. I think that they\u2019ve been feathered in over a period a time. And you\u2019re right we\u2019re seeing more technology changes more rapidly. But if you think about things like lane departure and parking assist, these things are all being tethered in. I can\u2019t see where all of a sudden there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of new things dropped on at one time that would cause the existing used car market to dramatically decline. I don\u2019t see that happen. I think it will be a continued tethered in as technology continues to improve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one. You had pulled out some kind of impact from the tax refund delay on used and wholesale. I realize that it\u2019s air math, but is there any way you can maybe somewhat quantify for us the impact on both those segments? Bill Nash : Yes. I think you called it air math, I think that\u2019s pretty good. No, we can\u2019t quantify specifically. But what I\u2019ll tell you and I\u2019ve talked about this in earlier remarks, there is a lot of factors, I think that are causing our performance and I think that\u2019s just one factor. I don\u2019t think any one of all the factors, whether the execution, improvements on the customer experience, whether it\u2019d be delays in the tax refunds, I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t believe any one of them is the majority of the reason. And I think that it\u2019s just one that we cited. But I also tell you, there is lots of other good things that are going on here and there is also other things like pricing and sales inventory availability as well. And again, I would just -- if you think about fourth quarter, over 8% comps; this quarter, over 8% comps. So, we\u2019re pleased with both quarters regardless of where the tax refunds fell. Chris Bottiglieri : Makes sense. Do you think it\u2019s more than 2% or is it like kind of like somewhere in that ballpark I guess? Bill Nash : I can\u2019t really do that air math. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just one follow-up related. Does this affect wholesale gross profit per unit? You maybe explain to us what are the drivers of the wholesale GPU per unit? Is that a true merged profit per unit or there are some fixed costs within that? Thank you. That\u2019s it. Bill Nash : Yes. The reason I cited it as wholesale GPU is because it\u2019s refunds coming to folks\u2019 pockets especially in the business it\u2019s a wholesale where it\u2019s the cheaper car, older car, more mileage e-car. Those customers, when they get those refunds, they come out in the market. When they come out in the market, it drives the prices up. So that\u2019s why we cited it as a factor, because it was a little bit of reversal trends that we\u2019ve seen lately especially citing -- we still have the dynamic of 7 to 9-year old vehicles, the lack of 7 to 9-year vehicles and that\u2019s a headwind both from a unit standpoint and a margin standpoint. But I think having some tax refunds that weren\u2019t received until the first quarter, it has an impact, because it puts those folks in the market, which drives up demand, which drives up prices somewhat. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. So, that wholesale GPU is just pure demand and supply, there is no like leverage in the backlog, like it\u2019s embedded in that gross profit per unit or like that, it\u2019s not volume related directly? Bill Nash : We could absolutely drive wholesale gross profit per unit, we could drive it up. But what that would mean is you have to offer less for the vehicles that were being traded in. And one, we want to make sure we provide a great customer experience; we want to make sure we\u2019re putting our best foot forward, giving the customer the most amount of money that we can for their trade, because we also know the trades are linked into sale. So, could we drive GPU higher? Absolutely, but it will be at the cost of 5%. Operator : You do have a follow-up question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So, another question actually on your web traffic increases. Can you give us a better idea of how much of that web traffic is from people going directly to the CarMax site and then how much is coming from search leads? And then secondarily, is there a way for you guys to kind of tell how much is coming through paid search and how much is coming through natural search? Because I think you guys have been working on trying to drive both if I\u2019m not mistaken? Bill Nash : Yes. So first of all, Scot, thank you for following the rules and getting back in line for asking the second question. You\u2019re right. We have been focused. Our big focus has been on search engine optimization and specifically non-brand. So, key demand search engine optimization is the one that we\u2019re not paying for; it\u2019s organically grown. And non-brand would be anything that\u2019s non-CarMax, so the customer types in Honda Accord versus CarMax Honda. We\u2019ve been actively working on that SEO non-brand. It started back I guess last May with the new website; that was an important first step. We\u2019ve been adding content that consumers want and expect. This helps the search engines see, okay that a content that\u2019s important. Most recently, we have continued to optimize these pages we continue to work on our websites that search engines like Google can find our pages; we put strategic little links that enable Google to find things that customers want to see on our website. And then, we\u2019ve also redesigned the pages so that Google can see all the content which we think is really important and we continue to add new pages of relevant data and new pages so for example we\u2019ve had Ford 150, Google can see that we have a Ford 150 page. We continue to add more pages, more specific pages, so let\u2019s say Ford 150 Raptor. So, we will continue this work. We are very pleased with the SEO. I think if you go back, we kind of used June as the baseline. If you use June as the baseline, our SEO traffic on a daily basis has tripled since June. So, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then the direct traffic, which is like CarMax, if somebody types in something, CarMax or carmax.com, that we\u2019ve also seen increases in that as well. But, we\u2019ve historically done well with that already. Scot Ciccarelli : That\u2019s very, very helpful. Alright, thanks guys. Operator : We do have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Michael Levin : Hey, guys, just wanted to clarify one earlier comment first. You\u2019d kind of attributed part of the SG&A increase to higher variable spending to drive comp growth. I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s just the normal kind of incremental spend and not that variable cost of driving incremental comp growth is getting more expensive? Bill Nash : No, that\u2019s just the normal. As the units go up, obviously the sales consultants, they are paid a flat fee, the more units you have. So that\u2019s just a normal variable spend increase that we would see. It\u2019s not like we change that dollar amount or anything on a per unit basis. Michael Levin : And then with regard to the home delivery test, I know, you\u2019d sort of structured it originally as you are basically completing the transaction at the customer\u2019s home and not fully purchasing it online which introduced some problems with certain state regulations. Are you looking to try and shift that as the customer fully purchasing it online before it\u2019s delivered as opposed to finishing at the customer\u2019s home? Bill Nash : No, I mean we\u2019re still finishing at the customer\u2019s home for those customers that are interested in it. Again, we think that\u2019s a -- being able to take the vehicle to their home and having the customer be able to test drive before they actually purchase it, we think is the right thing to do, if we are going to continue to deliver to home. And at this point, there is a small subset of customers that are interested in that. But I go back to what I said earlier, it\u2019s more -- the home delivery test is more than just delivering it to a customer\u2019s home, it\u2019s the overall experience and it\u2019s all of the functionality that goes with that. I think that\u2019s really what customers are interested in, being able to do that online and then the seamless integration when they come into the store is really important. And so, when I think about home delivery, I think about all of that. So, it\u2019s not just about delivering it to the customer\u2019s home. And I don\u2019t see us at this point, making them do everything online and then bringing them the car already bought. I think for the time being, we\u2019re going to continue to take it to them, let them just take it for test drive; if they decide not to buy it, then we take it back to the stores. Michael Levin : Doesn\u2019t that kind of prevent you from putting into wide distribution, because of certain state regulations though? Bill Nash : Yes. There is absolutely some state concerns, different states approach both out of store vehicle sales and online sales differently. And I think you have to be aware of what those regulations are. And as it\u2019s written in some states, you can\u2019t legally do that. So, we\u2019re focused on that and make sure that we\u2019re going to play by the rules as appropriate. Operator : There are currently no further questions in queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters for any closings remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you, Victoria. Look, in closing, I want to thank you all for joining the call today. I want to thank you for your continued support. I also just want to highlight, our success is absolutely due to our associates, and I want to thank them. They are the true differentiator of CarMax and they\u2019re driving what\u2019s possible everyday for each other, for our customers and for our communities. I want to thank all 24,000 plus associates for what they do. And I look forward to talking to everyone next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me thank you again in advance for asking only one question and a follow-up before getting back in the queue. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. As always, I will talk about the quarterly results including the impact of Hurricane Harvey, then I will turn the call over to Tom to review financing after which I will comment on our initiatives as well as share some information on Hurricane Irma. Our used unit comps for the second quarter increased by 5.3% and total used units grew by 11.1%. Used unit comps continue to be driven by strong store execution as well as enhancements to the online customer experience, both of which support an increase in conversion. The impact of higher conversion on comps was partially offset by the effects of lower store traffic. As you may recall, Harvey hit Houston during the last week of our second quarter. CarMax\u2019s first priority will always be the safety and wellbeing of our associates. We have approximately 1,000 associates in the Houston area and while all of them are safe now, many were affected by the hurricane. We supported them with financial assistance through our Associate Disaster Relief Fund and provided them pay for the regularly scheduled shifts while the stores were closed. In addition, we sent emergency supply to Houston as soon as possible to support associates and their families. All six of our stores in the Houston market were closed for the last 5.5 working days of the quarter. Five of the Houston stores reopened on Friday September 1st with relatively little damage. Our Gulf Freeway store remained closed until Friday September 8th. We estimate the impact to our comps to these closures was small and as we said in the past, weather can delay sales but we generally expect to make them up in future periods. This event reminded me once again of the incredible value of our national footprint and our nationwide transportation network. We have been able to leverage both as damaged vehicles needed to be removed and replaced with vehicles from other markets to quickly support the needs of our customers. Now, I\u2019ll update you on some more of the numbers. In the quarter, we were pleased to see website traffic growth of 17%, which we believe was partially result of our efforts in SEO. Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at $2,178 compared to $2,160 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units grew slightly in the second quarter. The growth in our store base and an increase in buy rates were offset by the continuation of lower appraisal traffic. Gross profit for wholesale unit increased to $950 compared to $870 in last year\u2019s second quarter, largely due to a favorable depreciation environment in this second quarter. A few other topics and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year old vehicles increased to 80% versus about 76% in last year\u2019s second quarter. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks rose to 27%, which is similar to last quarter but up from about 25% in last year\u2019s second quarter. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased almost 11% to $405 million. This represents a year-over-year reduction of $9 per unit in SG&A. Several factors impacted SG&A growth including the 12% or 19-store increase in our base since the beginning of second quarter of last year, higher variable cost due to our increased sales, and an increase of about $16 million in our accrual for incentive pay. Remember that last year, we disclosed the measurable reduction in SG&A related to incentive pay. These were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense which was largely due to comping over the $10.9 million retirement related expense for our former CEO, recorded in last year\u2019s second quarter. As we previously discussed, we continue to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer experience. SG&A expense was in line with our expectations in the second quarter but recall that the first quarter saw the benefit from favorable expense timing, some of which could materialize later in the year. Lastly, during the second quarter, we opened three stores, one in the Hartford market, one in San Francisco and one in Salisbury, Maryland. During the third quarter, we plan to open five stores, one will open in Tyler, Texas, which is a new market for us, the other four stores are in current markets including Philadelphia which we just opened a couple of days ago, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. CAF net penetration was 43.5% compared to 45.3% last year\u2019s second quarter. We continue to see overall growth in credit applications, but more pronounced at the high and low end of the credit spectrum. Remember, last year, we were seeing measurable growth in credit applications at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in application volume at the lower end. Tier 2 financing represented 16% of sales compared to 17.5% in last year\u2019s second quarter, and third-party Tier 3 grew modestly to 9.6% of used unit sales, this compared to 9% for the same period last year. We also continue to see growth in sales where customer paid cash or brought their own financing; that was up to 25.4%, as you can see in the table in the release. CAF net loan originated during the quarter rose 7.5% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This was due to CarMax sales growth and an increase in average amount financed, partially offset by the lower penetration. CAF income increased 12.5% to $107.9 million, driven by the 10.6% growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision. This was partially offset by slight compression in the portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.8% of average managed receivables compared to 5.9% in the second quarter of last year, but consistent with what we reported in the first quarter. The loans originated during the quarter at the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.6% compared to 7.4% a year ago and 7.8% in the first quarter. The ending allowance for loan losses at about $130 million was 1.15% of ending managed receivables, up from 1.08% in the second quarter of last year but down sequentially from the 1.18% in Q1. As you remember, we were seeing unfavorability in losses over the course of last year. This quarter\u2019s loss experience is directly in line with our expectations. Losses in Q2 were not affected by Hurricane Harvey and the provision does not include any potential loss experience from weather events as the impacts are unknown at the current time. With regard to our capital structure, during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $157 million. Now, turn it back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. We continue to be focused on driving what\u2019s possible through both execution and innovation. We are in a unique position to combine the state-of-the-art online experience with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for. Whether in store or online, we want to give our customers the tools and support to find the perfect car, purchase that car and then receive that car all on their own terms. Last quarter, we gave you an update on the test of our online appraisal tool. This is a new online tool that allows customers to receive an appraisal value for the vehicle by submitting information online. We rolled out this product to the rest of our Charlotte market stores this past quarter and in the third quarter we plan to expand to more stores in the Midwest. We\u2019re receiving great feedback from our customers and sales team about this new offering. The purpose of this test is to further learn about the customer demand for online appraisals and to ensure a great experience that is scalable across all stores. We\u2019ll take the learnings from this next round of test to continue to enhance the product and determine when it should be rolled out to more of our stores. We also shared with you last quarter the progress we\u2019re making in digital merchandising, which is how we showcase our vehicles on carmax.com. In addition to the rollout and improvement of indoor photo studios, we\u2019re expanding our capabilities by offering 360 degree interior photos with zoom capability. We\u2019re now testing this product in vehicles at seven stores. These are just a couple of examples improvements we\u2019re working on. We will continue to build out our e-commerce capabilities and equip our associates with the right tools to make the entire car buying process simple and seamless, both online and in our stores, and we truly feel that no one is in a better position to do that than us. Before I open up the line for questions, let me give you a brief update on the impact of Hurricane Irma. We\u2019re pleased to report that all of our stores are open for business. We closed 28 stores, primarily in Florida and Georgia for varying lengths of time in September. And as we previously discussed with weather events, we would expect to realize those sales later. Now, at this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the work you\u2019re doing on the visual, the photography online. I know, you\u2019re kind of in different processes and you just talked about another test that you\u2019re working on. How are you assessing the impact of those tests as it relates to either traffic to the store or conversion? And then, assuming that these are going well, how long would it take to kind of implement better visuals online across the entire system? Bill Nash : Good morning, Sharon. Yes. So, on those, both the photo booths and the 360 photos, we assess the success of those by clicks on the websites on those particular cars. So, obviously, not all of our photos are done in photo booths. And so, we look at the success, the number of clicks we see on those cars, as well as the conversion of those vehicles compared to other inventory that doesn\u2019t utilize those capabilities. As far as the time that it would take to roll it out, I talked about last quarter, the photo booths, at the time, we already had 16 open; this year, we\u2019re on schedule to get 19 more of those open. And then for the 360, we\u2019ll see. Right now, we already have it in seven stores, and we\u2019ll see how it goes, and we\u2019re still working on the equipment, that kind of thing. So, stay tuned. I can\u2019t really tell you, okay, next quarter will be this number and that number, because we\u2019re still looking at the experiences. We want to make sure, when we roll it out more widely that it meets what we would expect from a CarMax standpoint from exceptional experience. Sharon Zackfia : And can I just a quick follow-up? So, the photo booths in particular is the rollout pace based on the expense of it or based on you just not being sure of the ROI of it? Bill Nash : No. I think the rollout is -- we can only handle so many different projects in any one given year, while there is an expense associated with it, that\u2019s not the reason why we aren\u2019t rolling them out quicker. So, we can only -- I mean, we\u2019re adding an additional 19 more this year on a base of 16. It just takes time and resource to get those built. Tom Reedy : Yes. Sharon, we\u2019re also thinking it up a little bit with just planned rehabs of the stores. Bill Nash : Yes. So, on the remodels, we\u2019re doing 10 more full remodels. We\u2019d like to work to photo booths into that and then we go and we choose certain other markets to go back and put the booths in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So, I have couple of questions with regard to the hurricanes. I appreciate the color you gave in your prepared comments. As far as recognizing that you don\u2019t provide guidance, just looking back at history, is there any parameters you can give us to help us understand what type of demand benefit that could come as a result of storms we\u2019ve seen recently, either in Texas or Florida or elsewhere? And then, the second question. You mentioned some of the -- I think you mentioned inventories in prepared comments. Was there damage to cars, vehicles in your inventory and would there be some type of charge that we\u2019d see as a result of that? Bill Nash : Okay. So, Brian, I\u2019ll talk about the first part. You hit it on the head. We\u2019re not going to provide guidance. What I will tell you is that we are prepared with inventory; we\u2019re prepared, if there is an inflow and extra inflow of vehicles being bought, we\u2019re in great shape to handle that in the markets that were impacted by hurricane. Believe it or not, if you look at that historically, we had the benefit of not having big catastrophic events like this that often. I think the last time, we cited something like this was probably back with Wilma and Rita where we actually talked about it in the call. But, I would just tell you, we\u2019ve positioned ourselves so that we\u2019ll be able to meet any demand that surfaces. As far as were there -- any vehicles were damaged. We had about a 1,000 cars that were damaged that had to be gotten rid of, basically scrapped. And I will let Tom talk a little bit about the expense. Tom Reedy : Yes. Brian, we\u2019re relatively fortunate in the Houston market, as Bill said, we had a significant number of cars damaged or destroyed but fortunately we do carry insurance for that type of event. And between our deductibles and then out of pocket for property and vehicles that weren\u2019t covered, we had about 1 million bucks of expense in the quarter. So, similar to other kind of catastrophic events that we\u2019ve seen in the past, but that\u2019s about the ballpark we have in there for property. Brian Nagel : Got it, helpful. And then my follow-up question, with regard to on the finance side, looking at the recent securitization data, the table you provided, it seems as though you\u2019ve been able to recently lift your lending rates. So, the question I have there is I guess to confirm that but also how should we think about the rates which you are charging customers going forward, is this kind of the beginning of the trend, any customer pushback at all in that? Bill Nash : Yes, you are correct. We talked about this last quarter and I think at the end of last year -- at late last year, we did raise rates pretty much across the board. I think this is the first securitization deal, 2017-3 where you are actually going to start seeing the impact of that and I think you can see the impact in that -- in the spread, if you look at that versus other recent deals. As far as where rates go. I am going to answer that the way that I always answer this for the last seven years, which, our ability to preserve that margin is going to be driven by the market and what\u2019s going on with other lenders. We are constantly looking at how we feel about our competitiveness versus other offers out there. We test rates up, we test rates down. We try to make -- we watch our 3-day payoff rate, we watch conversion of the stores. So, it will be an ongoing analytical exercise. To the extent rates go up, you could imagine we\u2019ll test increasing, I mean if the [cost of funds][ph] go up, we\u2019ll test increasing APRs, but if it\u2019s going to be detrimental to sales or make us uncompetitive relative to what other competitors are doing, we\u2019ll have to take that into account. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question is actually a follow-up to a point that you just made. So, to the extent that your CAF penetration was down a little bit and the so called other category financing was up by about 250 basis points in terms of penetration, is that a function you think of pricing? Clearly, your pricing in the totality of what CAF is doing is working on a unit basis. But, I am sort of wondering, is it penetration function of that? And also, we did note that the APRs on the new loans while favorably year-to-year did tick down slightly from where you were in Q1. So, if you kind of put that together for us, please? Bill Nash : Yes. So, I will just kind of run through what we saw coming in the door. As I mentioned, we were barbelled in the credit profile of the customer coming in applying. That means we saw the greatest growth at kind of 700 plus FICO range. So, those folks tend to be the ones that are going to be CAF or can arrange their financing elsewhere. So, Matt, I think some of what we saw was due to just the nature of the volume coming through. We did use some tightening in the quarter that may have impact in last year\u2019s fourth quarter but that may have impacted a bit. But we look very closely at how competitive we think our rates are. Our offers, particularly at the high end I think are still very competitive. And we also track that 3-day payoff rate which is good indicator of whether people like the offers they get from CarMax. That rate is up modestly year-over-year, less than a point, and it\u2019s actually down a little bit sequentially from last quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read into that. We\u2019re seeing a lot more people paying off the loans. When I look at it, I just think we\u2019ve got more people that are bringing their own financing to the table whether it\u2019s cash or something else, when they show up to buy the car. Matt Fassler : And then, my follow-up relates to the Tier 3 piece, up slightly year-on-year. Should we kind of view this now as sort of a reasonable baseline that high-single digit level in terms of sustainable level of Tier 3 penetration? Bill Nash : Yes. I don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve talked about this before when Tier 3 was significantly higher. It is a business that we look at as incremental. So, I don\u2019t know what the right baseline is? I\u2019d like to see going forward just kind of nice growth across the credit spectrum, because I think that implies the healthy economy and healthy demand environment. But this year\u2019s number is up slightly. As I said, we\u2019re seeing some volume increase in applications down in the spectrum. And remember, last year, we were seeing significant declines in that Tier 3 volume, and last year\u2019s number is a weak number. And this was actually the first quarter where we\u2019re comping over that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Rob Iannarone : Hey, guys. Rob Iannarone on for Scot. Congrats on a good quarter. I was just wondering, you commented that conversion was up and there was a partial offset from the traffic. I was wondering if you can provide any order of magnitude around that. Is it consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters? Bill Nash : Yes. I mean, traffic was down a modest amount, which offset some of the conversion. It\u2019s been similar to recent quarters. Rob Iannarone : Great. And just kind of on a different topic. When you think about the online appraisal and other online initiatives including SEO, can you update us on what kind of click through rates you\u2019re seeing? Bill Nash : Yes. Let me talk a little bit about SEO, because I think we\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen there. In the second quarter, our non-brand SEO traffic continued to grow significantly; it was up nearly 250% from a year ago. And on the SEO, what we\u2019ve really been focusing on is really three main things. One, we want to produce more content that links to other site, so putting articles out there to get picked by the folks, so that back linking is very helpful in the ratings. We\u2019ve added in the quarter a few hundred thousand new pages and we continue to add them. So, last quarter, I talked about having a page -- we used to have a Ford F-150 page and we said Ford F-150 Raptor. Now, we\u2019ve got a Ford F-150 Raptor 2016, 2017. Again, the more pages you have, the relevant you\u2019re in the searches. And then, we also are pleased, we\u2019ve been able to add content and put the content in there. So, Google can actually and the search engines can actually read it and see what we have, which also helps us. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with what\u2019s been going on with SEO. And we\u2019ll continue that work. And we think there is a lot of opportunity still there. The other thing I would just say on the earlier piece on the traffic, again, while that store traffic number\u2019s gone down, we really look at it more holistically. And we think about the store traffic, we think about web traffic, which I talked about earlier and the great growth that we\u2019ve had there. We also continue to see double-digit growth on leads, which is great because that gives us something to execute on. So, we feel very good about the momentum that we have when it comes to having possibilities to interact with the customers and turn them into sales. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. And this is getting back to the hurricane. With respect to Harvey and all of those flooded vehicles, what controls you have in place to avoid buying any lemons for example? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, similar to like Katrina, there are going to be a lot of flood vehicles out there. And all of the damaged cars that we had, we actually took them and sold them through. We did not sell them through auctions; we sold them through salvage auctions. Our systems are way more advanced today than they were back at the time of Hurricane Katrina. We know, for example the cars that were on our lot, we\u2019ve got them on our system. So, if they ever pop up somewhere else, we\u2019ll know not to purchase them. Now, they should all be marked salvage, so they shouldn\u2019t pop up somewhere else. But the same thing for other vehicles, other vehicles that are marked salvage, we know that information and then when we\u2019re at auctions or if they come to our appraisal lane, our systems will alert our buyers to the fact that hey this vehicle was at some point salvage. The other thing that I would tell you is -- and this is where our more than 1,000 skilled buyers come into play, there could be some cars out there that slipped through the cracks and didn\u2019t get salvage, not our vehicles but ones that come in our appraisal lane. And our buyers are skilled and trained to be able to identify those vehicles. There is telltale times that they can look for and I think that\u2019s a huge competitive advantage to make sure that we don\u2019t end up buying any of those that might fall through the cracks of the data analytics. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And my follow-up is on the extended protection plan growth, you\u2019ve seen I think more rapid growth in that category than even your car sales growth. And curious what\u2019s driving that and if there is a change in consumer behavior, or you\u2019re changing the way you are marketing that to consumers? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the way to characterize it is that that number is going to move around a little bit every quarter because like the CarMax Auto Finance business, we put a reserve on that thing for returns. And then, some quarters you might see mildly favorable return experience, some quarters mildly negative; the last couple have been mildly favorable. So, there is a little bit of a tailwind on that number due to the return reserve percentage. But in general, it\u2019s grown with the pace of growth of sales. And that\u2019s how I think about it over the longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning. Just sort of a multipart single question here, so I\u2019ll try to keep it simple. You talked about lower store traffic, but I\u2019m just curious if you wrap it together with the 17% increase in website traffic, if you think in total your eyeballs or interaction with consumers were flat to up. As we think about that in the context of your online appraisals where you being kind of ticked off with the consumer spending more time online as opposed to coming into the showroom? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the way you should about it is we do know, first of all, 9 out of 10 of the customers buy from a start their search online and interact with us on the digital properties. I do absolutely feel like customers are coming to the stores more prepared. So, for example, they know that they\u2019re going to need a step; they bring it with them versus coming in and having to leave. Certain things like that would actually cause your store traffic because we count it by being braced would actually cause it to go down or innovation like the online finance prequalification. There may be some customers that go online and realize I can\u2019t afford a new used car and it keeps them from coming into the store where they would have come in before, sales consultants would have spent time with them only to find out that they weren\u2019t eligible to buy a car. So, in some senses, I would expect because of our innovation, the traffic would go down, as we continue to innovate and make more of the functionality available online. So, again, I\u2019m pleased with where we are, if I think about the touch points that we have with customers, whether it\u2019s in the store or whether it\u2019s online. John Murphy : And then, maybe just a follow-up, when we think about it, I mean, it does sound like that may eat into year ability to bid on vehicles in the appraisal lane there and you may need to source more auctions. Do you think that may be the case, and as we think about profitability from sourcing vehicles on trading or appraisal versus the auction, is there a big delta in GPU there? Bill Nash : We\u2019ve talked about our appraisal lane vehicles history have always been more profitable than the offsite. As far as, I think, if I understand your question, really asking about the online appraisals and how we think that\u2019s going to manifest itself. Is that the question? John Murphy : Well, I\u2019m just trying to understand, because it seems like, your ability to convert appraisals or what are the online or in store from the consumer versus what you\u2019re be doing at auction going forward might shift. I\u2019m just curious, if that\u2019s the case. Bill Nash : Yes. I don\u2019t mean -- we\u2019re not intending that shift. I mean, we think that the online appraisal offering is just another way to reach out to customers that maybe we wouldn\u2019t have gotten before and also enhance the customer experience, so folks know what their vehicle is worth, prior to coming into the store, prior to selling it. So, the way I look at it is it\u2019s really an extension to generate more appraisals. Look, we had 11% growth in sales. When you have double-digit growth in sales like that. You\u2019re going to have to obviously rely on offsite. I would tell you, I think there is a lot of good offsite buys out there. It\u2019s the number of year to four year all cars coming into the auction lanes is higher than it has been in the past and I think it will continue to be that way. So, I don\u2019t see a real change in the dynamics. I think we\u2019ll continue to go after as many appraisal buys as we can and then we\u2019ll supplement with whatever need through outside channels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank. Mike Levin : Talked about rolling out the online appraisals to the Midwest. Just wanted to see, if you give a little bit of color around what sort of traffic uplift you\u2019ve seen in the test markets. And how you\u2019re expecting that to play out with the larger rollout? Bill Nash : No. It\u2019s too early to talk about that Mike, at this point. I mean, like I said in my opening remarks. It seems to be well received by customers; our sales folk, sales teams are very pleased with it, but it\u2019s too early to tell which is another reason why we\u2019re going to roll it to some additional stores. Mike Levin : And just want to see if you can give a little bit of color from your perspective on what you\u2019re seeing in the kind of just overall used pricing environment following all the storms, what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of scrappage coming out of Harvey as well as Irma? Bill Nash : I think for the longest time, people have said that the sky is falling, when it comes to used car pricing and there is going to be a big drop in used car prices. While we are seeing some acquisition prices more favorable, like this quarter our ASPs actually went up, and that\u2019s the combination of acquisition price going down a little bit, but then our mix impacting it to go up. So having more zero to four-year old cars, having more large SUVs and trucks. I think what we\u2019ll continue to see is we\u2019ll continue to see more late model cars entering into the marketplace. It\u2019s hard to tell, what the two storms, this is lots of different numbers, I think anywhere from 0.5 million to 1 million cars. And you go to wonder of that, how many of them are actually going to be replaced. So, I think, it\u2019s little early to tell us as far as what impact this is going to have on the overall market. I will tell you -- and I mentioned in the opening remarks, the depreciation environment has absolutely been more favorable. It\u2019s more representative of what we saw two years ago, which is one of the reasons why our wholesale margin is up over last year. So, I think it\u2019s little too early to tell us as far as the storms go as to what impact it\u2019s going to have on values. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just on digital leads. You talked about continued double-digit growth, but is that figure accelerating or decelerating? Bill Nash : It\u2019s pretty consistent with what\u2019s it\u2019s been the last few quarters. That\u2019s double-digit and it\u2019s a little bit more than the website traffic growth that we saw. Seth Basham : Got it. And as you think about the quality of those leads, how would you asses them relative to last few quarters, are they improving or not based on the types of leads that you are getting? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the quality of the leads is very similar to what we have seen over the last few quarters. So, there is no real big difference there. Seth Basham : Got it. So, as you go forward and you roll out some of these other tools, like appraisals as well as a soft credit pull associated with pre-approval of financing, how do you expect those things to trend? Bill Nash : Look, I think any time we get a lead is an opportunity for us to execute better. So, I would love for us to be able to have those leads convert at even higher. And again, I think our job is to make sure that we continue to put experiences out there and functionality out there and continue to train our associates on how to maximize those leads. So, that\u2019s what we are focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. I just want to get an update on home delivery. And broad strokes based on what you\u2019ve seen in that past couple of quarters, are your efforts inspiring more confidence in home delivery as a service or is it perhaps reaffirming apprehensions you may have had before embarking on the testing? Bill Nash : Yes, no, look, we are pleased with where we are on home delivery at this point. I would remind you. I mean, we want to make sure that the customer can find the right car, take it out, buy that car and then we deliver it on whatever terms they want to receive that car. Home delivery is one of those ways. And expedite delivery in the store is another one of those ways. And I think the big success in home delivery at this point is the additional functionality that we\u2019ve learned about and progress. So, for example, online appraisals, you need to be able to do that for home delivery. And as you see, we are continuing to move forward with online appraisals. We want to make sure that when we expand home delivery, it meets up to the exceptional customer experience that we would expect and that our customers would expect. We have not expanded beyond the Charlotte market right now. We are evaluating where to take it next. But what I would also tell you is, we\u2019re progressing that with capabilities so that wherever we go the next experience is going to be even that much better. So, I am pleased with where we are in home delivery, and I am pleased with all the functionality that really enables home delivery, so that we can use it in other things. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks. Good morning. A question on CAF and provision, which has been growing more than the charge-offs, we noticed every quarter since 2012; this quarter that growth was less than the charge-offs. Curious, if that says something about your expectation for future losses or just... Bill Nash : Yes. Rick, what it says is that I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019re seeing losses that are more in line with our expectations. And remember, last year, we were in environment where losses were kind of moving in unfavorable manner from us. And as we are look into provision, we were having to play some catch-up and getting the allowance to the level that it needed to be, based on the migration of those losses. So, I think we\u2019re more of in an environment now where we\u2019re booking we\u2019re absolutely booking the loans at a higher expected loss than last year. But we\u2019re not -- we haven\u2019t been seen that migration of bad performance and we\u2019re not playing -- the last two quarters are not playing catch-up. Rick Nelson : My follow-up is on the weighted average contract rate, 7.8% last quarter, 7.6% this quarter. Is this due to origination shifting up the credit spectrum and curious, if you in fact are getting better pricing on loans of similar quality? Bill Nash : As I mentioned, all the pricing changes that we made were over the course of the fourth quarter of last year. So, if you look at sequentially versus last quarter, we\u2019re behaving essentially the same in our underwriting decisions and our pricing decisions. So, I would attribute that then to kind of the credit quality coming in the door. And as I mentioned that the highest credits, what we\u2019re seeing that -- where we\u2019re seeing the largest growth this quarter, and that would translate into lower rates because those folks are going to qualify for better rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just kind of following up on Rick\u2019s question. So, your allowance actually went down sequentially to 1.15%, and that\u2019s the first decrease we\u2019ve seen in a couple of years. Anything in the mix of customers that you\u2019re seeing or any other commentary you can provide us with on why that went down? Bill Nash : So, I think, as I said, we have seen a higher mix of customers, but if any, we\u2019re looking at the performance of the portfolio and recent trends. As we mentioned last quarter and at the end of the last year, we made some changes to the way that we are calculating our loss allowance to make it a little bit more reactive to current trends. And like I said, last year we were chasing unfavorability; this year, it\u2019s been little bit more consistent. Bill Armstrong : Okay. And then, my follow-up question has to do with your wholesale gross profit per unit, benefiting from a more favorable depreciation environment. I\u2019m not sure how to interpret that, and how your spreads between what you paid and what you fill them for benefited from that? Bill Nash : Yes. So, like I said, it\u2019s a little bit representative of what happened a couple of years ago where the depreciation ramped. Normally, you see depreciation throughout the year. The slope of that ramp was pretty much muted. So, there wasn\u2019t a lot of depreciation. And we\u2019re wanting that doesn\u2019t proactively speculate or whatever on what vehicles are worth. But when there is less depreciation in vehicles off their value, that\u2019s typically not what normally happens this time of the year. So, when there is a favorable environment where there is not a lot of depreciation and the value holds up there, the dealers are willing to pay more money, and that\u2019s what drove the prices up. Bill Armstrong : Okay, great. That\u2019s kind of what I thought. But, yes, thanks for the clarification. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Hey Bill, hey Tom. So, a strategic question for you guys. Amazon seems to have a rather aggressive definition of their total addressable market. They don\u2019t seem to roll anything out including kind of auto or auto related retail. And of course, your management team and your Board are following Amazon\u2019s moves very closely, I\u2019m sure. One could argue the combination of Amazon\u2019s digital commerce platform and technology buying power could make a really formidable combination with your best-in-class ecosystem. I\u2019m just wondering if you view Amazon as emerging competitor or potential partner? Could CarMax be Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods of automotive retail? Bill Nash : I don\u2019t know. I mean, you\u2019d have to ask Amazon that. I mean what we\u2019re focused on is regardless of who the competitor might be, I think we\u2019re focused on making our business better and we\u2019re focused on continuing to be a leader in late model used cars. All the initiatives that we\u2019re working on I think point us in the right direction. I feel really good about where we\u2019re going and that\u2019s what our focus is right now. Adam Jonas : Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to online appraisal. Do you have any timeline on when you want that rolled out nationwide, say by end of calendar 2018? And then, my follow-up would be, after that what is the next big additional focus for you? Bill Nash : On the online appraisal, like is said in my opening remarks, we\u2019re putting it into some of the stores in the Midwest and the purpose of doing that is one, to make sure that it\u2019s a great experience and it\u2019s what we want to do. There\u2019s going to probably some enhancements that we\u2019re going to want to make. And we\u2019ll at that point determine what the next step is and what the roll out. So, I can\u2019t tell you what the timeframe is. As far as when that will be rolled out, it depends on how this next test goes. And I am sorry. What was the second part of your question? David Whiston : Once you\u2019re either done rolling it out or completed what you want to do on online appraisal, what will be the next big digital focus for you? Bill Nash : We probably have 15 different product teams that are working on digital enhancements, everything from SEO to improving the financing. I mean, some of these things like finance online for example, but we made some big strides in this last quarter, putting out a new application that\u2019s more mobile friendly, it\u2019s easier and to accurately enter all the income sources that helps educate consumers about the value of co-applicants; it has an enhanced calculator. Some of these things that we\u2019re doing, they\u2019re going to be product teams and things that we continue to work on. In other words, there isn\u2019t an end in sight. We need to continue to evolve and we can continue to make them better. So, some of these things, online appraisals, I think that\u2019s one that will continue to evolve, even when we have it rolled that everywhere, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done. So, I think there is a lot of different things that we\u2019re working on that will provide both, near-term, mid-term and long-term results for the organization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to refresh understanding of the support you\u2019re getting from your comp support from store growth. So, I was just wondering if you could remind us what your store rent is for new stores, what percent of target maturity do you do in year one, and how quickly does that ramp between years two and five? Bill Nash : So, as we\u2019ve said all along, we\u2019re going to open up between 13 and 16 stores, this year we\u2019re doing 15 stores. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re pleased with how all of our new stores are performing; they\u2019re meeting our internal growth rate. Outside of that, there is not a lot of color to add. Chris Bottiglieri : And then, 200 to 250, is that still the right number to think about in the 100 small format? Bill Nash : I\u2019m sorry. What was the number? Chris Bottiglieri : 200 to 250, I think have I in my note within the 100 small format stores? Bill Nash : I think what we said over time is you think about 200 to 300; 200, you can obviously drop from the equation; I think 300 still a good target to think about. But it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t tell you what the end game is going to be, because the customers\u2019 expectations are continuing to change, our business changes, continues to evolve; we\u2019re looking at different things. We\u2019ve got a lot going on in the digital space. So, I don\u2019t know where the cap is. I also don\u2019t think that we found a 100% of our store delivery methods. We probably have some things and ways to reach customers that we don\u2019t reach them today. So, it\u2019s really hard to put a high-end number on what that could be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : Hi, follow-up question on hurricanes. Historically, after these events, have you guys been able to increase your market share in markets where they have occurred? Bill Nash : Yes. Like I said, earlier, Seth, we, believe or not, we haven\u2019t had a whole bunch of, even like with Katrina, we didn\u2019t have any stores down in that market. So, we haven\u2019t had a lot of experience there. I think the last time, we cited something was again back with Wilma and Rita and we did see an impact on extra sales from that. But like said earlier, we\u2019re prepared, if there are going to be incremental sales coming in for replacement vehicles, then, we will be prepared to service those customers. And we\u2019ll talk about it -- we\u2019ll talk about it in the third quarter, what we actually saw. Seth Basham : Fair enough. And then, one other question is related to innovation technology spend that you guys have; obviously ramped that in recent years. How do you think about the piece of that into your next fiscal year? Bill Nash : Yes. I think -- I don\u2019t really want to talk about the fiscal year, next year\u2019s fiscal year at this point. I think all along this year, I\u2019ve told you that this is going to be a heavy year on spend there. While it\u2019s not all incremental, we should reprioritize some of our existing SG&A. We\u2019re putting a lot of money back into the business so much so that I\u2019ve told you guys in the past that normally say 5% comps we\u2019ll have as leverage. We\u2019ve said mid-single-digits. I think it\u2019s going to be higher end of mid-single-digits for this year. And depending on how much progress we make this year and what opportunities we see out there will dictate what we do next year. Operator : There are currently no further questions. Bill Nash : Okay, great. Before we close, I definitely want to take a moment to thank the more than 24,000 associates we have across the country. These hurricanes have absolutely been challenging these last few weeks. And I\u2019d tell you, I\u2019m once again reminded why our associates are true differentiator for CarMax. Their determination, their spirit, their support for each other, for our customers, for our communities through these challenging times has truly been inspiring. I\u2019ve never been more proud to work with them and I really want to thank them for what they do on a daily basis. It truly is incredible. And I want to thank you for joining our call. I want to thank you for your support. And we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Denise, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the CarMax FY2018 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today as usual are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin as usual let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that can affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 filed with the SEC. I know you all remember to ask only one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue. We appreciate it. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll start-off by talking about our quarterly results, then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to review financing, then I\u2019ll update you on our initiatives. Our used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 2.7% and total used units grew by 8.2%. Used unit comps were driven by the effects of hurricane Harvey and Irma, along with higher conversion in our stores, partially offset by lower traffic. Excluding the hurricane impact, comps this quarter would have been essentially flat. Our website traffic grew in the third quarter by 19%. This is a result of the continued investment in our online customer experience, including SCO and additional functionality. Gross profit per used unit once again remained consistent at $2,148 compared to $2,155 in the third quarter of last year. Our wholesale units grew more than 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. In addition to the expansion of our store base, this growth was supported by the favorable depreciation environment we saw through most of the quarter. As a result, we were able to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers, which we believe led to a higher overall buy rate. Gross profit for wholesale unit also increased this quarter to $933, compared to $900 in last year\u2019s third quarter. Again, we believe this was largely due to the more favorable depreciation environment. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix, SG&A and store openings. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year old vehicles increased to 81% versus 78% in last year\u2019s third quarter. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks was 26%, which is down somewhat from the second quarter, but similar to last year\u2019s third quarter. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased about 12% to $400 million. This represents a year-over-year increase of $81 per unit in SG&A. Several factors impacted SG&A growth, including the opening of 21 stores since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, which represents a 13% growth in our base and an increase of $8 million or $42 per unit, approximately half due to higher share-based compensation expense and half related to our accrual for incentive pay. Remember last year there was no accrual in the third quarter. As we previously discussed, we continued to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer and associated experience. Lastly, during the third quarter we opened five stores, one in a new market in Tyler, Texas and four others in existing markets, including Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle. In the fourth quarter, we will open four stores, two are in new markets for us, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which opened earlier this month and Portland, Maine. The other two will be in our existing markets of Boston and Denver. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. With regards to sales mix by finance channel, CAF net penetration decreased modestly to 44.2%, compared to 45% in last year\u2019s third quarter, Tier 2 represented 15.4% of sales compared to 17% in last year\u2019s third quarter, Tier 3 from third parties grew to 10.8% of used unit sales compared to 9.7% last year and similar to prior periods this year, sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing also increased relative to last year\u2019s third quarter. The allocation of sales across our lending channels was for the most part driven by the mix of credit applications. We continued to see growth in applications across the credit spectrum. It was more pronounced at the higher and the lower ends. Also, we did observe some weakness from one of our lenders in the Tier 2 space. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 8.6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This was due to CarMax\u2019s sales growth and an increase in the average amount financed, partially offset by the lower penetration. CAF income increased 15% to $102.8 million, driven by a 10.4% growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision, which was partially offset by slight compression in the portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables, compared to 5.8% in both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.7%, compared to 7.3% a year ago and 7.6% in the second quarter. The ending allowance for loan losses was $128 million or 1.11% of ending manage receivables, up slightly from 1.10% in the third quarter of last year, but down sequentially from 1.15% in Q2 of this year. Now, I\u2019ll turn to corporate finance items. As you probably noticed in the release, we experienced a reduction in our effective tax rate. The tax provision was positively impacted by $8.7 million in Q3. This relates to our adoption this year of the new FASB guidance regarding share-based compensation. The new standard requires the impact of share-based awards settlements to be reflected in the tax rate, whereas before it ran through shareholders\u2019 equity. We expected this would introduce volatility to our tax rate and this is the first quarter where it has been significant. In regard to capital structure, during the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million. That\u2019s down from last quarter\u2019s pace as you would expect based on the stock price during the quarter. Before I turn the call back over to Bill, I\u2019ll comment briefly on tax reform and its anticipated impact on CarMax. Our federal tax picture is pretty straight forward. So we would expect the substantially lower corporate tax rate to benefit our financial results and cash flow in future periods. We are evaluating the magnitude of the benefit, now that the legislation has been finalized and is awaiting the President\u2019s signature. Additionally, in the period of enactment, which we expect to be our fourth quarter, we will be required to revalue our deferred tax asset based on our estimated new tax rate. We believe this would result in a one-time unfavorable impact on our tax provision of an estimated $50 million to $65 million. This range could be impacted by our analysis of final law and our fourth quarter financial results. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. Now, I want to take a moment to provide you with an update on a few strategic initiatives around our innovation efforts, specifically developments in technology and online digital capabilities. The focus with technology is making it easier, faster and more efficient for our associates to provide an exceptional customer experience. While our legacy systems have served us well over the past 24 years, we\u2019re focused on leveraging new technology with a mobile first mindset. On the technology side, we are implementing a new enterprise-wide customer relationship management or CRM platform to develop a more seamless and personalized car-buying experience. The CRM platform provides sales consultants with a unified view of our customer shopping and selling history right at their fingertips. As we continue to evolve the platform, it will provide our sales consultants with even more visibility, including the customer\u2019s online research activities. The platform is currently in 100 stores and we plan to complete the rollout to all stores by the end of the fiscal year. The rollout has been a success so far and we\u2019ve received great feedback and support from our sales consultants. Another example of new technology is our mobile appraisal platform for buyers to use when preparing an offer for a customers\u2019 car. Historically, our buyers write down all the information they need to assess a vehicle and prepare the appraisal offer. With a new mobile appraisal platform, buyers use a handheld device to upload all the information in real-time at the vehicle. This makes the process easier and faster, and it should improve accuracy. The new technology has been well-received by our buyers. We have already rolled out the capability to more than 100 stores and planned to roll it out to our remaining stores over the next several months. Regarding our digital innovations for enhancing the online customer experience, we have a few updates. This quarter we expanded our test of an online appraisal tool to seven stores in the Midwest. The tool allows customers to get an appraisal offer for their vehicle by submitting information online. The test is underway in a total of ten stores now and we are continuing to evaluate customer feedback, and we\u2019ll focus on improving the product over the next quarter. We are also making significant progress with digital merchandising, which is how we showcase our vehicles on carmax.com. Last quarter, we talked about testing a new 360 degree interior photo feature. It simulates physically sitting inside the vehicle, including the ability to pan around and see everything inside, and a zoom capability to see finer details. The response from customers on this offering has been highly positive and we plan to roll it out to all stores by the end of the fiscal year. Remember, our goal is to provide an exceptional customer experience both online and in store that helps our customers find their perfect car, purchase that car and receive that car all on their own terms. We are proud of these improvements, and as we continue to make progress and others towards that goal, we are excited about the future ahead. With that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Denise? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : I guess question on the non-hurricane related markets in the quarter, when you think about the slowdown in the comps that you saw, I mean, is there anything that you would attribute that to? And then, kind of as a corollary, now that subprime is getting a little bit better as a percent of the mix, do you expect that to be a bigger driver as we get into the higher subprime seasons in the fourth quarter and first quarter? Bill Nash : Yeah. So, Sharon, on the first part of the question, the slowdown in the comps in the non-impacted hurricane markets, I tell you, I would point to something that I talked about that was a benefit for the wholesale business, which was the depreciation environment. This was the first quarter this year where acquisition price actually went up year-over-year, because we did not see the normal depreciation. And I think part of the reason we didn\u2019t see the normal depreciation for this time of year is because of the boost of the hurricane replenishment of those vehicles, which caused the overall values to hold up stronger than what they normally did. So, I think, that obviously, with continued pressure from new car incentives, I think, it\u2019s probably a combination of those things. And then, I\u2019m sorry, what was your second question? Sharon Zackfia : The\u2026 Tom Reedy : The subprime, Sharon? Sharon Zackfia : Yeah. So subprime looks like, I mean, it\u2019s the second quarter that\u2019s it\u2019s been improving on a year-over-year basis as a percent of the mix, and seasonally, that\u2019s just a more important business as you get into tax refund season. So just kind of looking for some perspective on how excited you might be that that could be more of a driver of comps going forward? Tom Reedy : I don\u2019t know if excited is the right word, because we are obviously more concerned about the denominator and overall growth would be best for us. But I can give you a little bit of color on the subprime. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw the volume of customer applications being strongest at the highest and lowest ends. So, I think, at least in our system that says that more customers at that low end are applying for credit than we have seen in the past. And another piece of puzzle from the perspective of the subprime penetration is, we have seen this quarter and in some last quarter as well an uptick in their conversion of the applications that they see, meaning conversion to sale. So there\u2019s been a modest uptick in the performance of those subprime lenders. I don\u2019t know how that persists, but obviously, after a period where we saw them declining several quarters ago, it\u2019s encouraging. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : Thanks so much and good morning. Two questions, first of all, the follow-up on the answer that you gave to Sharon\u2019s, the sales momentum in non-hurricane markets. You spoke about the rising wholesale price environment and the change in depreciation dynamic. Are you suggesting that perhaps you held back as prices rose and would that suggest that you deliberately walked from some share for a moment in time that you thought wouldn\u2019t be profitable or do you think that the market more broadly slowed down because the new used value equation clanged this quarter? Bill Nash : Yeah. Matt, I think, it\u2019s more of the market dynamics have just slowed down because of the depreciation environment. So it\u2019s the -- that\u2019s the second part of your question? Matt Fassler : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up, on wholesale volumes, you talked about your buy rate moving up given pricing dynamics. Do you think that you have adopted or adapted, I should say, to the pricing environment from a wholesale purchasing perspective differently than the market in this case as well, did you read it differently, was there some that you saw that enabled you to be more aggressive or similarly, was this kind of a market-wide dynamic in your view? Bill Nash : No. I think, what you have to do is you have to think about it kind of over a year-over-year basis. And so last year, if we saw the normal seasonal depreciation for this time of year, that we are not speculating on where the market is going, we kind of trail the market and adjust as it goes down, we follow it down and so it puts more pressure on the margin, and when your offers are going down, it impacts your buy rate. In this quarter, where you don\u2019t have the depreciation, any time you have more of a flat depreciation market or an appreciating market, it makes a little bit easier to maintain your buy percent, because you are giving offers -- higher offers to consumers. Matt Fassler : Understood. Thank you so much, guys. Bill Nash : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani with MN Retail. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bill Nash : Good morning. Tom Reedy : Good morning. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask first off on a more philosophical level, but when you think about the tax reform impacts, can you share any thinking around the potential to reinvest into either sharper pricing or even further enhance store level service versus increasing buybacks or dividends, just trying to think about how you guys might spend that potential windfall? Bill Nash : Yeah. Michael, well, we don\u2019t give guidance. We can say that as this capital materializes, we will carefully consider all of our opportunities and utilize the capital in ways that we believe will be in the best interest of the business, our associates, our customers and our shareholders. And like I said, so once it materializes, we will be evaluating that and I think there\u2019s a lot of different opportunities we could look at. Tom Reedy : Yeah. Mike, we can add a little color to that also. If you look back at our growth plans and our history, capital availability has not been a gaining factor for us in our decisions regarding growth and investing in our strategic initiatives. We are at the pace that we are at because we want to make sure that we can execute successfully on the growth and that we have the bandwidth to focus on innovation. So that\u2019s always going to play into our thinking with regard to our pace of growth and how fast we move on things as well. Michael Montani : That\u2019s great. And if I could just follow-up on the innovation comment, there\u2019s a lot of work that you all have been doing with online financing, search engine optimization and then also home delivery tests. So, I guess, I am wondering if you can just give us an update on kind of the latest learnings across the Board and just what you are seeing out there to continue to win share? Bill Nash : Yeah. Again, I think, we\u2019re approaching this from trying to make sure that we meet the customer on their terms. So whether they want to come to the store, not come to the store, do a combination of them in between the two, we want to make sure that we\u2019re prepared and you hit on some of the -- when I think about online financing, that\u2019s a capability that we are allowing the customers to do. SCO is, I think, about the growth, like our web traffic growth, a big percent of that growth, a large percentage of that growth is coming from non-brand SCO. And SCO is something that we look at every single day and it\u2019s something that continues to be some -- we\u2019ll continue to focus on every day, because the search engine algorithms are changing. We made a lot of progress there, everything from helping the search engines, find our pages, making sure that they can see the content on the pages, optimizing the content, adding thousands of new pages on there. SCO is going to be -- into the future is going to continue to, I think, provide benefits, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities still there. So, I would say that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in all of these things. The home delivery, when I think about home delivery, it\u2019s really the capability that we have been building, even though we haven\u2019t expanded the home delivery test beyond the Charlotte market, we absolutely are progressing that forward with things like online financing, with online appraisals, driving more traffic to the website. So, I feel good about the pace with which we are making the change and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those digital experiences. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I am curious if you\u2019ve mapped your consumer income profile, if you will against the revised tax brackets and the bill that the President may sign soon and just whether you see tax reform as a catalyst for the typical CarMax consumer? Bill Nash : Yeah. No. We haven\u2019t looked at that, Craig. And truthfully with the bill just signing and it hasn\u2019t even been signed, actually it hasn\u2019t even been signed by the President, but just passing. That\u2019s something that we can certainly look at going forward. But we haven\u2019t looked at that up to this point. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And as a follow-up, in the hurricane markets, are you seeing any excess traffic still or is that all subsided? Bill Nash : Look, I am not going to talk specifically about traffic patterns in any one market. But I will tell you is the further you get away from the actual event, the benefits vain and we have certainly seen that since the actual hurricanes. Craig Kennison : Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill Nash : Good morning, Brian. Tom Reedy : Hi, Brian. Brian Nagel : So, first question, again just a follow-up on the used car sales and recognizing that you don\u2019t give guidance, but as we look into fourth quarter and the issue you articulated, the depreciation or pricing that seemed to be a headwind ex-hurricanes here in fiscal third quarter. Should -- as we look into the fourth quarter, will that remain a headwind or do you see some type of abating -- would it start to fade? And then my follow-up question, I guess, bigger picture, we talked a lot about the digital initiative, you guys are obviously very focused there, but is -- could we -- given now that these initiatives have been placed for a while, is there a way to quantify what impact they started to have on sales? Thanks. Bill Nash : Okay. So, Brian, on your first question, you got it right, we don\u2019t give guidance, so -- for the fourth quarter. But what I will tell you about the depreciation environment, at the end of the third quarter we did start to see some depreciation at the end of the third quarter. As far as the digital initiatives, I am not going to speak specifically about any one initiative and what we think it\u2019s bringing to the bottomline. If I think about our comps, I think it is the product of a lot of things that we are working on, both the digital initiatives, but also execution in the store. And I can\u2019t point to one specific digital initiative that is leading to the bulk of the comps. It\u2019s just not that way and it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s a combination of all the different things that we are working on that has produced the result. Brian Nagel : All right. Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Bill, I know you have been asked a number of times about some of the sales cadence and sales results, but one more I wanted to throw in there. Is there a way for you to estimate the magnitude of a negative impact from the rising vehicle values, maybe by tracking your monthly or even weekly cadence against the changing wholesale price environment? Bill Nash : Yeah. There\u2019s no way to really to pinpoint that down. As I talked about in the opening remarks, I mean, I believe that that\u2019s absolutely having an impact, but to a degree it\u2019s really hard to pinpoint. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Then just a quick follow-up then, you did mention a negative impact from one of your Tier 2 providers, any chance you can help size that impact and then is that expected to remain a drag into the following quarter? Tom Reedy : I -- hey, Scot. I am -- I can\u2019t really talk about what we are going to see in the following quarter, because it hasn\u2019t happened yet. But I can give you a little color, Tier 2 and Tier 3 overall, there\u2019s a number of things that have been going on here. The volume that Tier 2 you are seeing has been much more flattish, as I said, since the growth of applications has been more pronounced at the high and low end. So that\u2019s planning it a little bit on the Tier 2. And then, as I did mentioned, we have a lender that has -- had a significant pullback. In the Tier 2 space we expected that every lender we are partnering with is going to bring some incremental value to the table. So if we see some weakness in one of the lenders, the incremental value that that lender is -- has been providing is likely to trickle down to Tier 3 and see them, and probably, have a little bit less conversion there. So we would expect that we are feeling some impact on sales. And it -- it\u2019s an issue that has been percolating for the last several quarters. I can\u2019t really say how long it\u2019s going to be. But the conversion in Tier 2 is down a little bit, because of that and then so for a combination of the volume, the conversion and that one particular lender, I think, Tier 2 is a little bit is weaker than it has been historically. And conversely, we are seeing Tier 3 up a bit, because their performance has been a little bit stronger, and I think, we are seeing some trickle down from Tier 2 into that space, that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise seen. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Sir your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Seth. Tom Reedy : Hi, Seth. Seth Basham : My first question is on web traffic, growth accelerated there, your comps decelerated a bit. Can you speak to what you are seeing in terms of the quality of that traffic growth and how online lead generation is trending? Bill Nash : Yeah. So, we are pleased once again with our website growth, if we look at individual leads, different lead types, so for example, appointments or holds, online financing, prequalifications, different lead types convert differently. So as the growth of those -- the traffic growth that we have seen, it\u2019s producing similar lead types we saw before, but on any given quarter, the mix of which ones are coming in can change, which will -- any given quarter can change the actual conversion, the overall conversion of those. I would tell you, I would much rather have that traffic coming in, have that lead coming in, because that\u2019s an area that we can or an opportunity that we can continue to execute better on. So I am pleased with the growth. We haven\u2019t seen a real decline by lead type in conversion, but it just depends on the mix of leads that are coming in. Seth Basham : Got it. So the biggest thing to clarify this quarter is that you had a shift in the mix of leads coming in as opposed to conversion on each individual type of lead? Bill Nash : That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s exactly right. Seth Basham : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. John Healy : Thank you. I wanted to ask just a bigger picture question on store traffic. It\u2019s clear you guys are doing well with innovating the business from a technology and a customer, what I say a conversion standpoint. But is there way or any initiatives underway to kind of maybe drive the older model of just getting people into your stores and driving the awareness of the CarMax brand? Is there anything we should expect in calendar 2018 to maybe try to reinvigorate that kind of store level traffic, people coming to you, because they know you in the community and know you provide a good value, those types of shoppers? Bill Nash : Yeah. John, I\u2019ve talked about this before. I am really trying to get people to think about the business a little bit differently. Historically, we have always focused on store traffic. But nine out of 10 of the customers that buy from us, they start by hitting one of our digital properties. So the way we think about is not just store traffic, but web traffic, leads, quality of leads. It\u2019s really how many opportunities do you have to turn a customer or turn someone into a customer. There may be some things that we do digitally, for example, online finance prequalification that may prevent people from coming into the stores. So, for example, somebody goes on and gets prequalified and they realize they can\u2019t get financing, and therefore, they don\u2019t come in the store. That\u2019s actually a good thing. Now that would drive store traffic down, but it keeps that person from coming in the store and utilizing a sales consultant\u2019s time. So we\u2019re really looking at how many engagement touch points do we have and how are we doing with that. So as far as specifically driving just store traffic, I think, about it more holistically and think about, okay, let\u2019s start at the upper end of the funnel. John Healy : Okay. Fair enough. Bill Nash : Yeah. And, John, the other thing is, I would tell you, we still haven\u2019t, if you think about our digital spending, think about advertising as a whole, we still spend the bulk of our advertising on traditional like broadcast TV, radio, which is really an awareness brand building. So we will continue to do that, about 30% of our ad spend, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s probably more in the high upper 30%\u2019s of our advertising spend is more digital. And I would think that we\u2019re going to kind of maintain that mix for a while. John Healy : Fair enough. And then just a follow-up question either for you, Bill or Tom, when you think about tax reform, one of the things I have been thinking about is highly competitive industries and I am not sure necessarily where to place the used auto business in that kind of spectrum. But do you think this is an industry that holds on to that absolute profit benefit associated with tax reform or do you think it\u2019s likely that maybe over a multiyear timeframe that the gross margins or the operating margins in the business kind of adjust and you don\u2019t necessarily hold on to that that savings? Bill Nash : Yeah. John, I don\u2019t know to be able to speak to the whole industry and what they\u2019re going to do with that available capital. Like I said earlier, we\u2019re going to evaluate it at the time it starts to materialize, and, certainly, one of the things that we will be looking at is from a competitive standpoint, how are we looking. But, again, that\u2019s just one of the factors that will be considering as this money materializes. John Healy : Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I just had a question sort of about the short-term and long-term and thinking about the used price versus the resids on lease agreements and it does seem like in the third quarter with the relative increase in used vehicle pricing, relative to expectations, that may have floated closer to resids or maybe even above resids, but as we go forward and we see the increasing supply, used vehicle pricing might come under pressure and those might go back below resids. So I am just curious, I mean, there\u2019s this thesis out there that dealers will hold on to these vehicles coming back off of lease, which is what appears to happen in the third quarter to some degree, on your third quarter anyway. How you think about that going forward and is this temporary impact that you sort of saw in the third quarter sort a result of this? I am just trying to figure this stuff out? Bill Nash : Yeah. John, I\u2019ll say, I think, the wholesale market is very effective and very efficient. And when you see something like the dynamics of the third and the demand goes down, it will quickly write itself. If dealers aren\u2019t selling vehicles, they are not going to be coming and buy those cars. Dealers can only hold out so long not selling cars and not bringing cars to the auction. So, what I can say is from past experience is, when we\u2019ve seen things like this, it eventually, because the market is efficient, it eventually turns around. John Murphy : And that should ultimately result in better same-store sales comps for you, at least that\u2019s my opinion, I won\u2019t put words in your mouth? Bill Nash : It should -- it should absolutely result in more attractive used car pricing and drive the pricing down and of course, when we have more attractive pricing from the acquisition standpoint, we can pass that to the customers and that becomes even that much more of an attractive deal versus a new car. John Murphy : Yeah. And what we are hearing from the auction is that there\u2019s a lot of institutional cars waiting in the wings that were sort of skittish. Just -- and just sort of one follow-up, when we think about the SG&A factors, it inflated to, I think, up $81 per unit, you didn\u2019t cite technology spend as a sort of inflationary factor there. Are we at the point where your tech spending is sort of run rating similar year-over-year and there\u2019s no anticipation of a significant step up that would on a like-for-like basis inflate SG&A going forward and if anything it may tail off over time? Bill Nash : Well, over time, I think, the growth will -- the growth of that spend will absolutely tail off. If I think about SG&A, we had a fairly sizable increase in compensation and benefits, part of that, we highlighted stock-based comp and the bonus accrual, but part of that is also the folks that are working on our strategic initiative. They are embedded in there and the other overhead costs, that\u2019s where some of the costs are showing up. And like I said all along this year, this is a heavy investment for us. This is millions of dollars. But what we try to do is not make it all incremental and we -- I think we have done a good job of reprioritizing, stopping things, repurposing people. So, what I would tell you is, the investment is baked in here. It\u2019s just within a couple of the different breakout lines on SG&A and I think it\u2019s offset by some of the things we decided not to do that aren\u2019t surrounding our initiatives. The other thing I\u2019ll tell you is, this year is going to be a heavy investment and depending on how this year ends, I would expect next year we\u2019ll continue to invest. I talked briefly about the technology changes. We have made a lot of improvement on the customer experience side and added functionality, and now we are really doubling down on the technology that gives our associates a world-class experience. And as I think about those two things, I cited both the CRM and the mobile appraisal app for our buyers. I am pleased, I mean, those are two things that pretty much have, we started the rollout this year and we\u2019ll get one of them completely rolled out by end of the year and the other one will be soon after the end of the year, and that\u2019s couple of facets of our business and we still have other facets to the business that we want to tackle as well. So we are on a little bit of a journey here. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Your line is open. Rick Nelson : I\u2019d like to get your view on third-party lead generators. What proportion of sales come through these lead generators and it\u2019s had an opportunity? Bill Nash : Yeah. So, first of all, our primary focus is on our website. We\u2019re trying to get the customers come to our website. There\u2019s probably 16 million to 17 million hits coming through there. Having said that, we want to continue to use third-party generators, in the third quarter we had vehicles on CarGurus, Edmunds, KBB, to name a few. And the way we think about those is they are complementary to our website. We also look at them constantly to make sure that it\u2019s good economic decision and what we are paying for those leads is way more than offset by the sales that we are actually getting. If we talk about the digital spend, as I talked earlier, as part of our overall advertising, third-party lead generators or search engine marketing that is a majority of our digital spend. And we\u2019ll continue to put dollars there. It will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, depending on how productive those third-party generators are. Rick Nelson : Thanks for that, Bill. Also I\u2019d like to get an update on your home delivery tests and how that\u2019s progressing? Bill Nash : Yeah. So, Rick, like I said earlier, we still got the home delivery in the Charlotte market at this point. What we have been focused on is continuing to build out the capabilities that will not only enable home delivery but other ways to deliver customers. And like I said, the progress I think we\u2019re making on home delivery is by adding all of this functionality, whether it be the mobile appraisals, whether it be the consumer prequalification on the financing. You build the capabilities, that enables not only home delivery to scale very quickly, but it enables maybe other ways to deliver cars to customers, like expedited delivery, that kind of thing. So I feel really good about the progress that we are making. Rick Nelson : Okay. Thanks and good luck. Bill Nash : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James Albertine : Great. Thank you and good morning. And if I may just very quickly say thank you and we\u2019re going to miss Cliff, but want to wish him the best in his retirement and congratulations to Ed, Darren and Joe on their promotions as well. Bill Nash : Thanks, Jamie. Cliff Wood : Thanks. James Albertine : On a -- from a long-term sort of strategic perspective, I think, we are all sort of working off of this idea of sort of 300 to 400 stores at maturity and sort of this comp leverage points in the mid-single digits. I am just wondering, as you are learning more and seeing more success from your digital initiatives, if you could provide sort of an update on your brick and mortar growth strategy, and whether or not sort of you are pivoting to a lower store count over time and would hope to fill in more markets with sort of digital initiatives and if that has an impact theoretically on bringing the comp leverage point down as well? Bill Nash : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Jamie. So, historically, we\u2019ve talked in the range of 200 to 300 and, I think, on one of the recent calls I said, you can pretty much take off the 200, because we are essentially there. I really want people to stop necessarily focusing on some certain target end range, because we\u2019re continuing to learn about the business. I want people to think more about, how can we continue to grow our market share. If you look at zero to 10-year old vehicles nationwide, we are only capturing about 3% and in our more mature markets it\u2019s a little bit higher than 10%, and I don\u2019t know where that can eventually grow. I want to make sure we are capturing that market share. So how we do that, whether it be continuing to add brick and mortar stores or leveraging digital, that\u2019s what we will continue to evolve over the next few years. We are opening up 15 this year. We have already committed to 13 to 16. I feel very comfortable with that pace. But as far as an ending store number, I am not really comfortable putting that out there at this point, because the business is changing, consumer expectations and behaviors are changing and look, to be honest with you, the more we can do and grab market share with our existing infrastructure I think is a huge win. James Albertine : Understood. Well, thanks for taking the questions. Merry Christmas, happy holidays and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Bill Nash : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from are Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So it looks like you were able to tactically drive volumes at wholesale. I was wondering if you could talk more broadly stepping back about the air pocket you saw in \u201809 through \u201811. As you are cycling through that like what\u2019s your view on that, when do we lap that, like what\u2019s you are going to experience in this cohort then? And just lastly, if you\u2019re able to could you maybe tell us what the average age of typical vehicle in wholesale? Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. So, Chris, the average age of our vehicles in wholesale is still right around 10 years. As far as the impacts of SAR kind of that bubble working through, really it\u2019s still in that seven-year to nine-year old vehicles. When you think about the SAR being reduced, seven years to nine years ago, those cars are still funneling through or lack of those cars are still having an impact and I think we are probably at least another year and a half or two years out before I think that really returns to normal. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. I am going to give Katharine an early year end gift and limit myself to one question. So thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi. This is a follow-up question on finance, as we look at the quarter I think one of the clear positives here was a better trend in finance. So the question I have and I guess, stepping back is, maybe what\u2019s -- how do you think what\u2019s happening in your finance businesses? The better trends we are seeing now are function of a true better performance or is it more a function of, should I say, a change in expectations from what we saw last year? And I guess that, as a follow-up, the question on that too is, if you look elsewhere, there\u2019s been more signs of, I guess, some stress in the finance markets, but CarMax is performing well here, so to a certain extent you guys -- you are bucking the trend? Tom Reedy : Yeah. I\u2019ll speak to that, Brian. I mean, if you look at the CAF income picture from kind of a big picture perspective, receivables are up 10.4% in the portfolio, that\u2019s the combination of what we are originating, what\u2019s -- and what is rolling off. Our interest margin contributions are only up 8.8%. So we are still seeing a bit of compression in that. But as we are growing the portfolio, the loss provision is lower by $4.4 million this year and that\u2019s really reflection of last year we were in an environment of escalating losses. So, not only were we missing our booked expectations, but we were building the provisions for expectation of higher losses. And this year in all three quarters we have been generally in line with our expectations. So that -- I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward how the environment has evolved, like, where it goes from here, I am not sure. With regard to us versus others, I can only speak to what we are seeing in our system and the performance of our partner lenders, and as I mentioned in the Tier 3 space, we\u2019ve seen some improvement in conversion of the applications that they see. And I could also remind you that back when we saw the subprime part of our business start to decline, we were -- we -- other people were not seeing the same thing at that time either. But I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re bellwether or we just run a little bit differently than what you\u2019re hearing elsewhere. Brian Nagel : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. You line is open. Matt Fassler : Thanks again. Also a quick follow-up, a question about the relationship between the cadence of the wholesale market and your used car GPU, one of the questions we have gotten as we have approached the quarter is whether the fact that you were able to sell through vehicles, particularly early to midway through the quarter that you had purchased in a more benign wholesale and depreciation environment would have helped GPUs. So I am curious whether that did play out for a part of the quarter or whether the market adjusted such that the arbitrage that might -- that we might have expected wasn\u2019t there? Bill Nash : Matt, are you talking about wholesale GPUs? Matt Fassler : I am talking about retail, to the extent that the market moved higher, the cost of goods moved higher through the quarter if you turn your inventory every 50 days or 60 days, whether the cars you were selling through early would have come at a more advantageous price or whether frankly you just managed two GPUs, so that you would reign in the potential profit to move the units? Bill Nash : Yeah. I mean, Matt, you have been following us long enough now, I think, Katharine, this is the 27th quarter we have pretty much been consistent on our GPUs. And so as far as having a benefit in the early part or the latter part, I think, we have been able to prove that during different depreciation times, whether it\u2019s rising, whether it\u2019s declining, we have been able to manage our inventory. I think it\u2019s one of the strengths that we have as an organization, and I would say, this quarter really didn\u2019t present any other abnormal challenge. I will tell you, the only thing that\u2019s a little bit abnormal this time of around was -- from a GPU standpoint was the decision to help the customers in Houston with free transfers in. So that was probably the only kind of abnormal thing that we saw this quarter. Matt Fassler : Was there any -- and just following up on that, this is my last one, any measurable cost impact from that or the aggregate of the hurricanes that weighed on your EPS, I don\u2019t think you have given us a number that might have held you back a bit this quarter? Bill Nash : Yeah. I would tell you, I would probably, it was -- it\u2019s pretty much non-material. Matt Fassler : Got it. Understood. Thank you. Bill Nash : All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions queued up at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill Nash. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Denise. I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I want to thank you for your continued support, providing exceptional customer service and continuing to improve our business is part of our DNA and I am really grateful took more than 24,000 associates that we have and for everything that they do each day to make this possible. I want to wish all of them and all of you all a happy holiday and we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Katharine Kenny : Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 filed with the SEC. Thank you in advance for asking only one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll be in today\u2019s call with our quarterly results than I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom, who will be financing and later I will update you on our initiatives. Our used unit comps for the fourth quarter decline by 8% and total used units fell by 3.1%. This is driven by lower traffic and relatively flat conversion. Remember that in the fourth quarter, we were facing our toughest year-over-year comparison. We are disappointed with the decrease in our quarterly comps, which we believe it\u2019s partly due to macro pricing factors that resulted in a softer sales environment.  Although used vehicle pricing has fallen since October 17th, valuations were still significantly higher than in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in CarMax\u2019s average selling price in the fourth quarter was due to growth in our average acquisition costs and would have been higher absent the changes in our sales mix. At the same time, new vehicle pricing appears to have fallen further with [indiscernible] still higher than last year. These dynamics, which vary over time lead us to believe that during our fourth quarter, the pricing spread between new and late-model used vehicles was pressured which we think adversely affected our sales.  Despite the softness in our fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the fact that the used market has historically been self-correcting and we believe that off lease supply that continues into the market should drive used prices lower. For the calendar year, our data shows that we were able to grow our comp market share by almost 7%, the largest increase in 4 years. Our website traffic grew in the fourth quarter by 16% as we continue to enhance our website and SEO capabilities. Gross profit per used unit once again remained consistent at 2,147 compared to 2,134 in the fourth quarter of last year.  Our wholesale units grew by 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due primarily to the growth in our store base and the continuation of a higher buy rate. The buy rate was supported by the higher used vehicle valuations. Gross profit for wholesale unit of $946 was similar to the $938, we reported in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The decrease in other gross profit was primarily driven by lower unit sales, which impacted EPP and service. In regard to service, we also saw some compensation related pressure due to the fact that approximately one half of our discretionary bonus was allocated to service.  Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year old vehicles decreased to about 76% versus 77% in the fourth quarter last year. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were slightly above 27% down about a 0.5% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and up from 26% in the third quarter. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $409 million or year-over-year increase of $207 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense including the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, which represents an 11% growth in our base and a decrease of $9 million or $0.47 per unit related to share-based compensation expense.  In addition, as we discussed in the past, our SG&A expense growth continues to be affected by our investment in technology platforms and digital experience. However, this quarter\u2019s deleverage was largely due to our comp sales decline.  Lastly, while Tom will review how tax perform impacted quarterly results, let me briefly address our strategy on the use of cash flows created by the reduction in our effective tax rate. Our goal is to continue to invest in our associates and in our company and drive higher shareholder returns.  As we mentioned in our press release, we paid a one-time discretionary bonus to eligible associates which was about 80% of our population. For FY \u201819 we implemented additional associate benefit options and we\u2019ll be evaluating more enhancements in the future. We also plan to invest incrementally in our business including our digital and technology capabilities. While this thing will put pressure on pre-tax income growth in FY \u201819, we would still expect 70% to 85% of the tax benefit to impact our bottom-line. These investments don\u2019t change our current outlook on SG&A leverage. We continue to estimate that we would begin to reduce our SG&A expense per unit at the higher end of our long-term guidance of mid-single-digit comps. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter we saw some of the same year year-over-year trends in sales mix by finance channel that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, specifically some decline in Tier 2 originations, growth in Tier 3 and modest expansion in the percent of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing.  The allocation of sales across our lending channels was largely driven by the mix of credit applications. Tier 2 accounted for 15.4% of sales compared with 18.2% last year. Third-party Tier 3 grew to 11.7% of sales -- used unit sales compared to 9.4% last year. And CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs remained flat at 42.8% versus 42.9% of last year\u2019s fourth quarter. CAF net loans originated in the quarter were flat at 1.4 billion. While unit sales were lower, we saw an increase in the average amount financed commensurate with the growth in CarMax\u2019s average selling price.  CAF income increased 22% to 101 million. This was due to result of a lower loss provision and the 9.4% growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a slight compression in the portfolio of interest margin.  Total portfolio of interest margin was 5.6% of average managed receivables compared to 5.7% in both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 7.9% compared to 7.4% a year ago and 7.7% in the third quarter.  Our ending allowance for loan losses was 129 million or 1.11% of ending managed receivables. That\u2019s flat sequentially from Q3 and down from 1.16% in the fourth quarter of last year.  Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me make a few points about tax and about capital structure. As you saw in the release, the revaluation of our deferred tax asset was 32.7 million which is significantly lower than our early forecast. This was largely the result of deliberate tax fining actions. Between the December when tax reform enacted and the end of our fiscal year, we identified and executed on a number of opportunities to optimize tax savings related to the change in tax law. For future quarters, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 25%. Remember, as we have seen in the past, there has been variability around that estimate due to state taxes and other items such as the adaptation in fiscal 2018 of the FASB guidance regarding share-based comp concession. We would expect this potential variability to continue in the future. Regarding capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $128 million. For the full year, we repurchased 8.9 million shares at a cost of $574 million. As of the end of the year, we have approximately $1 billion remaining in our authorization. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks Tom. During the quarter we opened four stores, two in new markets for CarMax, [indiscernible] South Carolina and [indiscernible] and two in existing markets, Boston and Denver. During fiscal 2018, we opened 15 stores and had 188 stores open at the end of the year.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we planned to open three stores. Our store in the Greenville North Carolina market opened last week and is a new market for CarMax. The other two were opened in Dallas and Miami both of which are existing markets for us. During fiscal 2019, we once again plan to open 15 stores, 10 of which will be in what we define as small markets as MSA\u2019s with a population of 600,000 or less. We also plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020.  Now I want to update you on some of our strategic initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we completed the full roll out of our new enterprise wide customer relationship management or CRM platform to all stores. The new CRM platform enables a more seamless and personalized car buying experience by delivering a unified view of our customer shopping and selling history across all locations. We are also testing an extra [ph] pick up feature in our Charlotte North Carolina in Lynchburg Virginia stores. This option allows the customer to do virtually everything from home and complete the purchase at the store. The expatiated pickup can take us as little as 15 minutes but it's all driven by customers interest in reviewing information about the vehicle for completing the test ride. In addition, we completed the roll out of our new 360 degrees in terracotta featured to all stores. As part of the roll out, we also updated our photo software in all stores which will dramatically improve our ability to quickly innovate our photo capabilities in the future. And finally, we rolled out our new mobile appraisal platform for buyers to nearly stores this quarter. The platform enables our buyers to be more efficient which has reduced appraisal time. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on both advancing our technology capabilities for associates and our digital experience of our customer, not only for the quarter but for the year. This coming year, we will continue to focus on meeting the customer on their terms, whether it's in the store, online or a combination of the two. Customers want flexibility and control in their shopping and buying experience. Our associates, our national footprint, brand strength, infrastructure, inventory scale and our continued investments in technology and digital capabilities position us to continue to leave used car industry.  At this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Kim? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first quarter comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : My question relates to the dynamic focus in the macroenvironment and it's really -- have you ever seen the reactions [Technical Difficulties]. Bill Nash : Hey Matt your question broke up a little bit but I think you were asking about the macro pricing environment and kind of what we think about, as I said, obviously first-of-all we \u2018re confident about a tough year-over-year but a big factor of that is the pricing environment. I think it really hits on two sides, it's not only that our acquisition price went up on all inventory, but also I think that there was pressure on the spread as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I think there was pressure on the spread between a late model used car and a new car, but because of our acquisition price going up and new car prices coming down in relative terms year-over-year.  If I look back over the last two years, we've been seeing prices all of last year we saw our acquisition prices going down. The first two quarters of this year, we saw our acquisition prices going down. Third quarter, we saw a little bit of an uptick and then we saw significant uptick in the fourth quarter. I think this is one of those things we have seen in the past what it goes through like I said in my opening remarks, is the wholesale market is pretty much self-corrected. It takes a little bit of time but it will end up correcting itself.  The other thing I would just say is from a comparison stand year-over-year, we've lack some big technology improvements the biggest being on finance. Last year we saw a larger supply of affordable large and medium SUVs which we haven't seen year before. So, I think there is a lot of noise that's basically going on there. Matt Fassler : Can you hear me a bit better now? If we look for clues for improvements, should we be more focused on used car pricing so that we can follow that or focus on what we [Technical Difficulties]. Bill Nash : I think really what we should be focused on is just the overall wholesale environment and what is doing to prices across the board, are the acquisition prices going down or they going up. New car certainly plays and its part of that when you talk about the spread. So, it will be interesting to see as we go forward. Although it seems like incentives have started to come down a little bit, they are still higher than they were a year ago. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Can you help us better understand some of the various pressures on gross profit in the other category for the quarter specifically on the service revenues et cetera? Bill Nash : Sure, Scot. Like I said, on the service side, we had a little bit of headwind. I mentioned one for Thank You bonus, a big chunk of Thank You bonus went right to the service line. So, it was overcoming that. We also saw an increase in some health and welfare fringe benefits that went into that that line up as well. And then of course just the impact of lower use sale and the deleveraging by not selling as many cars also was an impact. Tom Reedy : Hey Scot, and to give you a little additional color too. I mean the way that we are accounting for this service business is that we have like kind of a standard cost and fee to each car. And we have to cover our overhead which is pretty much fixed and based on the staffing that we have. If we have a reduction in the cars versus our expectations, it doesn't cover -- that line item is not going to cover all of the overhead that we've got buried in there. Also, with regards to kind of compensation and health and welfare it's a very big piece of the overall P&L for service and some changes and it's a relatively small profit lines from a P&L perspective. So, swings in that part of the service line will have a more dramatic impact on the overall profitability there and then they do for the company overall reap all of the SG&A. Scot Ciccarelli : And then I guess the mix on the lending tier 2 to tier 3, that's pretty much a direct flow through from revenue down to the profitability, that's 100% flow through that $5 million. Tom Reedy : Yeah, I mean as we've talked before. Every tier 2 that swaps through the tier 3, you lose $300 in commission that we get from Tier 2 and it turns into paying out a $1,000, so there is roughly a $1,300 swing and everything you see move out of Tier 2 and into Tier 3. We\u2019ve also seen growth in other which represent zero versus something paid in Tier 2. Operator : Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is now open. Sharon Zackfia : I appreciate the color on the full year market share, and I know that shorter periods are kind of harder to discern. But I\u2019m just wondering, if you believe, you\u2019ve seen any signs of competitive infringement over the past few years or anything that would kind of impede the longer-term unit growth runway or market share runway? Bill Nash : No. From a competition standpoint, we believe our prices are absolutely competitive and part of that is just by the continued large volume of vehicles that we sell in any given location. I mean we\u2019re still averaging for the year over 330 vehicles per location. And that being said, we also monitor our competitive pricing both regionally and locally. And Sharon as you know, we\u2019re constantly testing every quarter raising prices, I\u2019m sorry taking our margin and maybe lowering it, raising it. We\u2019re doing pricing test all times to see elasticity on the impact that it has on sales. And what I would tell you is that we\u2019re obviously trying to sell as many cars as we can, but to also optimize total gross profit dollars. So, we feel very comfortable on the competitive landscape at this point. Sharon Zackfia : Can you also give us an update on where your aggregate market share is at this point and where is your top market share now? Is that Richmond or Charlotte? And where does that stand? Bill Nash : Yes. So, our top markets are going to be our oldest markets, because they\u2019ve obviously been through the most buying cycles. So, it\u2019ll be your older markets, the Richmond market, the Charlotte market some of these older markets. I think you\u2019re asking about the national market share how do we stand there? Sharon Zackfia : Right. Relative to kind of where you are in those oldest markets. Bill Nash : Okay. Nationwide, we obviously gain market share. Market share on the national actually was a little bit higher gain. I think 7% was the comp, national was a little bit higher than that. National was still about, when you look at zero to 10, we\u2019re still around 3.3% in the comp markets were more like 4.5%, 4.6% and then in our most mature markets, we\u2019ve talked about before, being at above 10%. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : The question I have, Bill I just want to dive a little bit deeper [indiscernible] the first question was asked is with regards to the pricing dynamic now and you\u2019re calling out that being sales the headwinds here in the fourth quarter. But just looking at how do we make sense of the various costs for example. Because there's clearly a larger supply of all these vehicles now hitting the market, which should be, it should weigh upon pricing. We go back to your third quarter conference call, I think we talked about post-hurricane this dynamic being an issue. But it sounded like it has started to normalized or abate somewhere early in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, the question I\u2019m asking is, what\u2019s behind all this, what\u2019s happening out here? And then is there still a hurricane, if you\u2019re and give us more specifics on how we should think about, when this this dynamic should abate? Bill Nash : Sure Brian. So, as I think about the supply. Like I said earlier, if you go back all through last year and through the first two quarters of this year, the added supply of let\u2019s say of leased cars coming into the marketplace absolutely benefited us from an acquisition cost. Our acquisition cost all of last year and for the first two quarters of this year were down, which we would expect to see when you have a higher supply of vehicles. There was the third quarter dynamic where you had this big push on inventory demand because of the hurricane replacement. So, in the third quarter we saw our acquisition prices start to tick up in the third quarter that continued into the fourth quarter. And remember, we were buying inventory during that period and we were buying inventory that will get us through a couple of months ahead of time. So, do I think that the -- we\u2019re kind of through the inventory anomaly that was post hurricane, I do think we are through that but prices still have to recover. While they are depreciating, they still haven\u2019t gotten back to where they were a year ago. Brian Nagel : Okay. And then as far as my follow-up and I understand it\u2019s difficult. But is there a way to isolate what specific impact this had on your comps and I guess another way to think about that is, is it -- is there a group of -- given the vast way of cars you sell, is there a group of cars that are just proportionately skewed to this? Bill Nash : No, I mean when we look at it, it\u2019s basically broad-based. Acquisition cost is up for pretty much everything. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s skewed to one group or another. And I think that\u2019s also just reflected in our wholesale performance and having a higher buy rate, more units in wholesale because it\u2019s reflective of trickling down the expenses up on everything. Brian Nagel : Is there any quantification of the impact on Q4 starting the comps? Bill Nash : Yes, I mean it\u2019s hard to say of the 8% -- negative 8% ex-amount. It\u2019s hard to say because it really trickles down into so many different things because for example not only is everything more expensive but last year we saw a little bit of a tailwind because there was more affordable large and medium SUVs. Well now everything is up. So, there\u2019s an impact on that. So, it\u2019s hard to actually quantify certain specific percent. But I personally believe it\u2019s been a large headwind. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. When you look at this quarter\u2019s comp, was there a bigger deterioration in comp traffic or conversion relative to the last fiscal quarter? Bill Nash : So, our conversion was basically flat. We had a larger decline in traffic when you think about it from quarter-to-quarter. So, I would say more of it was on the traffic than the conversion. Seth Basham : Got it. And when you think about conversion, it did slow somewhat. What do you think the drivers are of the slower conversion this quarter, is it simply flapping the roll out of things like pre-approval of financing online, are there things that you can point to from a conversion standpoint? Bill Nash : Yes, it\u2019s interesting because we\u2019ve been having some incremental conversion each quarter, here recently, and this one was a little softer. If you look website traffic for us, it\u2019s up again double-digit and a lot of that growth has been driven by SEO which generates leads just like paid advertising. I think when you look at the leads any specific [indiscernible] converts the same whether its SEO or SEM but what you have to look out on a quarterly basis is the quality of those leads, some leads convert a little bit better than other leads and I think during the fourth quarter we saw an increase in leads that don\u2019t necessarily correlate as high as some other more vehicle specifically. So, what do I mean by that? In the fourth quarter, we saw more appraisal leads, appraisal leads don\u2019t necessarily convert as high to sales as say a vehicle appointment leads.  So, in any given quarter, you can have a mix in the lead types and I think that probably plays into a little bit of the where we landed in conversion this time which I also think is highly impacted by some of these more macro pricing environments. Seth Basham : Got it, okay. So, continuation from last quarter in terms of the quality of the leads deteriorating a little bit in terms of the absolute growth in digital online leads, are you still doing double digit? Bill Nash : Yeah, we\u2019re still doing double digits but it's not as big double digits as what we\u2019ve seen in the past. And I think that\u2019s probably because we\u2019re lapping over some investments and some roll out and some things and I also its partly because of what we\u2019re seeing from a pricing standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani from MN. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey good morning thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask first off if I could, can you just discuss a little bit the credit and lending environment and in particular if there is any incremental tightening either from cash or Tier-2 partners or if you are more still in the motor cycling tightening that I think again around three quarters ago? Tom Reedy : This is Tom, I can kind of walk through. With regard to cap, we talked about some tightening last year and early this year but we\u2019ve been pretty much consistent in our lending behavior since then. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at rates that we all heard now with the increase in the benchmarks, but that\u2019s something we\u2019re doing on an ongoing basis.  As I mentioned, generally the shift in mix and the lending environment has been a result of the kind of the nature of the volume of applications coming through the door. I can comment a little bit on Tier-2 and 3, Tier-2 is down year-over-year about 2.8 points one is we have seen the application volume is down across the board, but most heavily in that kind of middle range. And we\u2019ve also seen some deteriorating and conversion which we have in kind of sales to applications if you look at in that Tier-2 space. I think some of that\u2019s the nature of the applications they\u2019ve been seeing and some of is lender performance in that space. We\u2019ve been talking about weakness in the last several quarters with at least one of Tier-2 lenders. I also think that in Q4 of last year we have been doing a little bit by some lender testing by other Tier-2 folks.  So, you know year-over-year in the fourth quarter I think Tier-2 was probably a bit of a headwind from us based on those factors. Tier-3 continues to perform well and we\u2019ve seen consistent over the course of this year at least since early call it April year-over-year improvement in their sales applications so in the quality of their activity for us and I think they\u2019ve also benefitted from some trickle down from Tier-2 not proving us strong.  But overall, I would describe the environment in our stores as robust as ever, they\u2019re significantly more than 90% of customers are getting approval coming the door and, in the Tier, -2 phase I\u2019d also mentioned that we've introduced another lender of course the year. And that is that Chase Auto. Michael Montani : Okay, great. That's helpful color. And if I could just follow up on two fronts. One is if you can provide an update on the home appraisal initiatives that you all have been doing as well as home delivery? And then the other question was just around finding that right downs between GPU and share. Because some of the data we have seen it looked like there was a modest growth to the market for used car units, but it came at a really heavy cost in terms of GPU when we think about some of the franchise dealer peers. And you all have always been -- think a little bit more disciplined in terms of balancing that. So here is the question was are you comfortable kind of continuing to sacrifice some shares if need to be in order to maintain or hold the GPU? Bill Nash : Okay so on the first couple of points, online appraisal and home delivery. So online appraisals we continue to test in 10 stores. We're actively working on different presentations to the customer and we're continuing to learn some different things. So, I don't really have an update for you on that at this point.  Home delivery, I tend to think about home delivery on a more broader view which is alternative delivery, home delivery being one of them. We've been focused on building out the capability to enable not only home delivery but things like expedited delivery and as you heard, we've started to test expedited delivery in some stores. So, I'm pleased with the progress that we're making on both of those fronts.  As far as the GPU and share. Look, I talked a little bit about it on earlier question. We want to maximize the sales and maximize -- we want to maximize sales but we also want to maximize total gross profit dollars. And could we have sold some additional cars if we lowered our margins and lowered our prices the answer is yes. Do we feel like net, net it would have netted out more total gross profit dollars, no. But that being said, we're continuing every quarter, we test that elasticity and we're doing test. So, it's not that we're opposed to changing up the GPU as long as it produces more as long as it produces better financial results and total gross profit dollars. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Ziehl from Oppenheimer Funds. Your line is open. Matthew Ziehl : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask if there was any weather related and I guess it would showed up in geographic in the fourth fiscal quarter related to winter weather we got back to normal to and at times nasty winter. Did you noticed any meaningful difference in comps between [Sunbelt] and more northern markets that's weather could have some impact and maybe had an aggregate impact? Bill Nash : Sure Matt, yeah, we obviously had lots of weather during the quarter. But like we were said in the past, weather generally once you get through the weather, you eventually went back those sales we don't think that it was any type of driver on where we ended up on comps. Because generally the only impact that would impact as you had a big weather events in a lot of stores at the very end of the quarter. And we did not see that. So, while there was impact on weather, we felt like, like we're always do that you generally get those sales back once the weather has passed. Matthew Ziehl : Okay, thank you. And just following up just to not the beat the horse too much on the gross profit question, you actually had your GPU tick up this quarter and it was a bit surprising that you\u2019re willing to forgo so much sales without even giving up any gross profit. its saying all or nothing 200 bucks or 300 bucks like some of your public competitors have. But it does seem a little surprising that, that you\u2019re willing to hold the line so hard on gross profit than it actually kicked up this quarter. Is that, how, maybe I don\u2019t understand, how you do your testing and how real time it is. But is it possible that you\u2019re actually surprised at the end of the day by how much sales were down and maybe your testing methodology of testing elasticity isn\u2019t quite as real time or rapid feedback as you need it to be? Bill Nash : No. First of all on the slight tick-up, that\u2019s within the noise range for us. That\u2019s not [indiscernible] we\u2019re going to make even more. That\u2019s just within the noise range. And again, I go back to, I feel very comfortable with our testing methodology and because we do it every quarter and we can see the results real time. So again, if you ask me if there was a surprise that we gave up so much sales, I just don\u2019t think that -- I don\u2019t see that. Operator : Your next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I guess, what surprised me this quarter was looking at the used car sales data from Edmonds for the industry looked like the number was up 3% year-over-year for December, January and February. So, given the lift there and then companies paying out employee bonuses including yourselves means people have more money in their pockets for purchases including cars. So, in light of those tailwinds, I was surprised to see the same-store sales coming where they were. Can you sort of walk me through what I might be missing there? Bill Nash : Yes. So, I can\u2019t speak to the Edmonds data. What I can speak to is, we look at market share on a 12-month period, because what we have found is that the market information is lagging. And it takes a couple of three months for it to catch-up, that\u2019s why we reported on 12 months calendar year basis since we have a better understanding. And we used pocked data, which is DMV data. So, what I would say is what we seen is for the calendar year at least that the overall used for market was fairly flat. So, I can\u2019t speak to the Edmonds for the last couple of months. Nor, I\u2019m not sure how accurate it is on such looking at it on such a short basis. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s hard to extrapolate, but have you seen anything as far as employees with the bonuses and coming back to your stores or just given the commentary you\u2019ve had on traffic that it\u2019s maybe not so much? Bill Nash : I wouldn\u2019t have anything that would call it out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just one more. You\u2019re opening up 15 new stores, 10 in small markets. Maybe you can talk a little bit about plans to drive same-store profitability given sort of the emphasis on driving profitability in stores versus the actual store count? Bill Nash : Yes. So, we are opening up 15 stores this year. And I\u2019ve talked about this before. While we still have plenty of runway to continue to open up stores. We want to continue to try to push comp growth in our existing stores. We want to try to get more out of the existing boxes that we have and we feel like a lot of these strategic initiatives that we are working on will help to enable that. So, when we think about growth, we think about market share and how do we continue to gain market share. And while adding stores is one component of that, equally important is continuing to make sure that we leverage the existing footprint that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just a first question, I mean given all the volatility or sort of spike up in used vehicle pricing, I mean Bill do every consider may be going a little bit slightly older in the age spectrum in these periods of time we get a little bit further away from since competition with new vehicles, try to help same-store sales, I understand you\u2019re very focused on GPUs and managing those but is there an opportunity to may be just drop six months or a year in the age spectrum? Bill Nash : Well, John, we will put out there on the front lot whatever the customers are looking for. We sell up to 10-year-old cars. Retail, we also have a huge wholesale business. So, we want to make sure that the cars we put out there obviously meet our quality standards. If they don\u2019t, we put them in wholesale. So, when I think about old vehicles, I kind of have to think about it and the aggregate of both retail and wholesale because I think as we look at some of the competitors out there, and they add lighter model used cars, that\u2019s really kind of something that we have been doing but we do it through it through the wholesale channel. So as customers want that eight, nine-year-old car, then we\u2019ll absolutely go and source it. But the pricing dynamic that you saw whether its light model used car or if it\u2019s an eight or nine-year-old, it still exists and the price is still up. So that\u2019s a headwind no matter which piece of the inventory you are looking at. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a quick second question and follow-up. Our understanding was there was a huge stocking of inventory out of the rest of the country into Texas and Florida post the storms and that really created this weird dynamic where there was excess inventory in those markets and not enough in other markets. So, for the supply of used vehicle pricing, it really just you need those vehicles to flow back out of those markets. It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s happening that quickly and pricing is remaining fairly high. So I know you kind of answered this question before, but I mean do you see that kind of dynamic in your stores and the options your buyers are going to where those vehicles are flowing out, we\u2019re getting this adjustment that was kind of back out towards the end of last year, and just trying to gauge when this normalizes because doesn\u2019t seem it\u2019s normalized quite yet? Bill Nash : Yes, I don\u2019t think inventory availability in our stores was a cause for concern for us. I agree I think there was a big influx of vehicles that went down there. We certainly supported our stores by moving inventory down there. But inventory has still been available around the country, so I don\u2019t think that that is a big factor. I do feel like we managed inventory very well this quarter given the softness in sales that we saw, inventory only grew slightly and that was really just to support the growth of the new stores. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open. Derek Glynn : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. I just had a follow-up on some of your initiatives. So, you had the logistics in place and the technology backbone to enable home delivery, your expedite pickup, if you decide to roll this out across your store base, how quickly could you scale this, what would that roll out basically look like? Bill Nash : Not really prepared at this point to talk about timing on that. I agree with you, I think we have an unbelievable logistics network that we continue to improve or continuing as I think about the investments we\u2019re making in the business, I think that\u2019s another area that we continue to invest in, in our transportation and our systems. What I would tell you is you know, we move a lot of cars, we\u2019re moving close to 2 million cars a year, moving cars is not an issue for us and moving cars and getting them to individual homes, that is not an issue for us. We want to make sure that when we rolled this, it's the product that we want out there representing CarMax which is why we have been so focused on building out the capabilities. So, I\u2019m not ready to talk about the full roll out on this but we\u2019ll talk more about that in future quarters this year. Operator : Your next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks, and good morning. Question on the small market expansion, are you noticing any real difference in the customer demographics there versus your legacy markets in terms of the credit income and the expectation either on service or also on back to John\u2019s question on the age of the vehicle they\u2019re looking more? Bill Nash : No, we haven\u2019t noticed anything that would be worth calling out and the main reason that we talked about the small markets just to give you an idea of the size of the store and therefore the volume but we have not noticed any noticeable difference on customer demographics. Tom Reedy : I\u2019d add a little color there. I mean we see differences in every market that we go to, Boston is different than Atlanta is different than Houston et cetera and we contemplate those differences in demographics in our estimates of how we can sell cars there and the small markets are no different. They\u2019re going to vary a little bit between themselves but in our models, we will contemplate those factors and make sure that we\u2019re investing the right amount of money to get the returns we need. David Whiston : Okay. Just one more question on buybacks, obviously you had a soft quarter now and there is a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment. My question is if you get a rather noticeable sell-off in the stock in fiscal \u201919 are you willing you accelerate your buybacks to be more aggressive? Tom Reedy : So the answer is yes, we\u2019re not going to share, we don\u2019t have any view at this point on what we would do and when we\u2019re continuously looking at that and as you know as we talked about in the past we take a programmatic approach to the buyback program targeting a certain target range for leverage to the extent we have more cash flow and need to manage to that level. We\u2019ll see a pick up, we took our real place so that our programs automatically buy more when the stock is looking at a lower value and buys less when it\u2019s a bit rich but we have the opportunity to do additional volume if we see fit and if that ever comes to fruition we\u2019ll obviously tell you about it. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just want to focus on the expense a little bit, if you maintained your mid-single digit algorithm despite the announced reinvestment, simple as we put back in the core algorithm. I want to get a sense as that just a lapping investment like smaller store growth on versus lease on something else, then I have a follow up? Bill Nash : Chris actually a function while we are continuing to invest, it\u2019s really a function of being very disciplined and making sure that we\u2019re taking waste out of both our SG&A and our cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve been focused on and I talked about our focus on that really for the last year and half two years. On the SG&A side, we\u2019ve really been focused on strategic sourcing and procurement, staff utilization on the cost to good sold side, we have been focused really on parts and labor efficiencies. And as I look at those two buckets over the last couple of years we've taken tens of millions of dollars out of there. And I think in addition that, knowing that we're doing some incremental investments I've talked about in the past now allowing at all to be incremental and being disciplined on what we're spending our discretionary money on as we continue to advance the organization forward. So, I think it's a combination of things. Chris Bottiglieri : That's helpful. And then, just want to step back in the mid-single digit algorithm. Can you just spend on the flexibility out there, obviously taking some cost out? But wanted to get sense how much of that's tied to like store growth and how much that's tied to like growth initiatives that you have. Just like what it could have to be in the mid-single digits and how do you think about that long term. Bill Nash : That's just the guidance that we basically have given. As we continue to grow we've always said it's going to take in that mid-single digit range. Although it's a little bit higher right now given the strategic investments. I would expect that overtime, as we have more stores and our new growth store growth becomes less of the percent of the store base. We should to be able to leverage less than that. What I would tell you is that time is not right now because we're investing back into the organization and into the future of the company. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi good morning again. So, I wanted to just go back again just pricing dynamic in the environment. What we're seeing in our channel checks if there is maybe a dislocation with regard to residual values and the off-lease vehicles going back to market. So, the question I have is, are you seeing that, is that interpreting to this pricing environment that you're highlighting. And if so, how does that came at the pace at which that they --? Bill Nash : Yeah and I assume when you're talking about the dislocation of the residual value you're talking about the cars that coming back and surprisingly they're not worth what they originally thought that were going to worth is that what's you're talking about? Brian Nagel : Yeah that's exactly what I'm talking about. Bill Nash : Yeah, I don't want to say I told that so. Back when we saw the high lease penetration, everybody is getting the leasing putting residual value on a vehicle is a tough thing to do. And as history repeats itself these cars come back, they're not worth what people thought they're worth. For us because we're not taking those cars in right from direct from the deal manufacturers buying those from the auction, they're going to do for what they're worth. They may hold on to them hoping that they'll bring more, but ultimately, they're going to end up selling it. So, we're buying them, we don't necessarily have to worry about what they have them and what they have to get out them. We're going to pay what we're willing to pay. So, I think while it may be impact some of the publicly traded retailers, that dynamic does not necessarily impact us. Brian Nagel : And from a bigger perspective, you've stepped back [indiscernible] you guys are not in well positioned to that. But could residual issue also be leading to even artificially higher prices in the marketplace with which you have to compete against, and then this has actually slowed down the pace of those cars eventually making their way to CarMax. Bill Nash : Yeah. Like I said, we've seen increased supply coming in for the prior six quarters before the third. I don't see we're supposed to have to a step up. And having to pay more on these vehicles to acquire them. If they do I actually think that's a good thing for us. Because our acquisition prices are going to be higher than what our acquisition price is through the auction line. So, I think that's actually a plus for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I don\u2019t mean to beat the dead horse on GPU, but can you be very specific for a 1% change in comp sales? How many dollars you think that takes at the moment and how that has changed over some period of time? Bill Nash : No. I\u2019m not going to be specific and tell you what 1% of sales which you have to do, from a pricing standpoint. And again, we look at this every quarter and surprisingly, it\u2019s been fairly consistent. The ratio has been fairly consistent but that\u2019s not to say that it doesn\u2019t change from time-to-time and we continue to evaluate every quarter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Bill Nash. Bill Nash : Thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. I especially want to thank our associates for everything they do. If you didn\u2019t see in February, we were honored again on Fortune Magazine\u2019s 100 best companies to work for. This was our 14th consecutive year on the list and this is truly a testament to our associates and how they care for each other, how they care to customers and how they care to the community. I want to thank you all for your time and your interest in CarMax and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to Bill let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for your follow-up. Bill. Bill Nash : Great, thank you Katharine and good morning everyone. Our used unit comps for the first quarter were negative 2.3% against another tough year-over-year comparison. The comps were driven by lower traffic and better conversion and represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter. Total used units grew by 1.6%. While used vehicle valuations were still higher than in last year's first quarter the year-over-year change in our mix adjusted vehicle acquisition cost was more favorable in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.  Industry data indicates some signs of recovery in the used vehicle market place since a slow down at the end of last year. These signs include improving supply at auction and more normalized depreciation. Our website traffic grew in Q1 by 16% similar to the previous quarter again due to website and SCO enhancements. Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at 2,215 compared to 2,212 last year. We had another strong wholesale quarter with units up 9.6% year-over-year. This again was due to our buy rate which rose to a multi-year first quarter high and to the growth in our store base. As I said in the past when used vehicle prices are higher we can offer our customers more for their vehicles which supports our buy rate. Our gross profit for wholesale unit was flat at $1,012 in both periods. The decrease in other gross profit was driven by lower service profits again negatively impacted by our lower used unit comps. Remember as we said last quarter as lower unit volumes we would expect service overhead to delever. We also experienced a reduction in third party finances due to shift in sales by finance channel. These were partially offset by increased EPP revenue. EPP revenue grew with sales but also benefited from provider cost decreases which created an opportunity for some margin enhancement and $4 million related to the new revenue recognition standards. Before I turn the call over to Tom let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales zero to four year old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus over 78% in the first quarter last year. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were almost 28% up about a 0.5% from both last year's first quarter and the fourth quarter. On SG&A expenses for the quarter increased about 9% to 438 million or a year-over-year increase of $143 per unit. There are several factors that impacted the SG&A expense including the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the first quarter of last year which represents a 10% growth in our base, an increase of $9 million or $43 per unit related to share based compensation expense and our continuing investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thank you Bill and good morning everybody. In the first quarter our sales by finance channel were primarily a result of the mix of credit applications we received. While application volume was slightly down year-over-year, we did see some growth at the very high and low ends of the credit spectrum. We experienced growth in CAF and Tier 3 originations. Tier 2 fell due to a combination of application volume and a change in the year-over-year lender behavior which we discussed last quarter. Tier 2 accounted for 17% of sales compared with 19% last year. While we experienced some tightening by Tier 2 last spring performance has been relatively stable since that time.  Third party Tier 3 represented 10.9% of used unit sales compared to 10% last year and CAF penetration net of three day payoffs grew to 42.9% compared to 41.9% in last year's first quarter. CAF net loans originated in the quarter grew by 8% to 1.7 billion versus 1.5 billion last year. This was due to growth in the average amount financed which was in line with the increase in CarMax's average selling prices. And the growth in CAF penetration rate on top of the modest increase in CarMax unit sales. CAF income increased 5.7% to $116 million. This was due to a combination of the 8.7% growth in average managed receivables and the continuation of modest compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables compared to 5.8% in the first quarter of last year and 5.6% last quarter. For loans originated during the quarter the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.4% compared to 7.8% a year ago and 7.9% in the fourth quarter, a reflection of our response to the current interest rate environment. Ending allowance for loan losses was 134 million or 1.13% of ending managed receivables, up slightly sequentially from the fourth quarter but down from 1.18% in the first quarter of last year. Moving to capital structure during the first quarter we repurchased 3.3 million shares for 207 million and now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks. During the first quarter we opened three stores, one in Greenville, North Carolina which was a new market for us and then two in existing markets, Dallas and Miami. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we plan to open another three stores. Our second store in the Albuquerque market which is in Santa Fe opened earlier this month. The other stores will open in Macon, Georgia which is a new market for CarMax and in our existing Oklahoma City market. You will note that there has been a decrease in non-com store contribution relative to recent quarters. This was due to a change in mix and the timing of store openings. As I mentioned earlier our website traffic continues to grow but we are improving the customer experience and growing leads through a variety of enhancements. This quarter for example we continued to make improvements to the speed and technical performance of the site. In addition we expanded and improved our personalized vehicle recommendations throughout the site. We also released the capability for customers to search based on the desired monthly payment. We continue to leverage our new CRM system. We're testing new ways to communicate with customers such as text thoughts, messaging, and appointment alert reminders. This allows us to improve the shopping experience and connect with the customers on their terms. As you know over the last couple years we placed a great deal of focus on the development and testing of new customer experiences such as finance pre-approval, home delivery, online appraisals, and the new expedited pick up test. Many customers have now tested each of these products both individually and in various combinations. These tests have allowed us to learn how to best build the features to meet their needs. In addition we continue to improve the features as consumer behaviors and expectations change. Our next step is to combine all these pieces into a comprehensive e-commerce experience that is comparable to our in-store experience. Because customers are now able to do more digitally before they come to the store we're also empowering our associates with new tools and training to leverage the customer's digital progress making it simpler, easier, and faster for them to complete their purchase. In the next few quarters we plan to take this comprehensive experience to new markets and learn how to best operationalize it in a scalable way. We will provide more information on these tests in future quarters. Now we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question this morning comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Fassler : Thanks so much and good morning. My question relates to credit, you spoke about the increase in the rates you are charging for CAF at retail both year-over-year and sequentially. In addition to the fact that we've got kind of a firm underlying used car price, can you talk about what impact that might be having on demand to the extent that it raises the effective price of the car bit more than the underlying tech market would? Bill Nash : Good morning Matt. You are talking about the impact of the interest rate rise may have on the demand for the used cars? Matthew Fassler : Exactly. Bill Nash : Yes, so well I think it's a factor. I believe that the bigger factors -- the used car consumer is interested in monthly payment and bigger factors that drive the monthly payments are the purchase price, the down payment, and the term. The small movements in credit rate don't have as significant impact as those other three items. Matthew Fassler : Are you seeing -- given that the average price seems like it's still rather firm and the market is still tight, are you seeing any change in the other two or is it potentially impacting mix in any way? Bill Nash : No, we are not seeing any market change in regards to that. Matthew Fassler : Got you, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning Brian. Brian Nagel : Congratulations on this quarter. My question with regard to the used car business, so clearly there was a significant pickup acceleration in fiscal Q1 and Q4 now Bill in your prepared comments you talked about I guess less, you mentioned less pricing pressure. So the question I have is, was that it, as you look at this quarter and going from a negative 8 to negative 2 call it was the absolute primary factor less pricing pressure, if not what were the other factors and as I think about the pricing dynamic, I guess this is maybe a somewhat of a follow up to Matt's question but how does that progress through the quarter and how should we think about it so far here in fiscal Q2? Bill Nash : Okay Brian, good question. So I think the best way to talk about this is first start talking about what I talked about in the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter we had higher acquisition prices, we talked about the spread, it was unfavorable between late model used and the new. We obviously had a tough comparison. We also talked about, there was a post election talk from the prior year. We also saw there was a more supply to prior year on large SUV, more affordable ones. So there was a litany of things but certainly the higher acquisition price in that spread was a major call out. And what I would tell is it is still -- there's still a large spread year-over-year on acquisition although it is trending in the right direction. I also think that if you look at the Consumer Price Index it looks like new cars are holding their value, have started to hold their value again better than used cars which started in this quarter. So I think both of those helped this quarter. And again we're still continuing to work on a lot of our initiatives and make progress on it so we have another quarter of that and that I think helps to benefit. And then there's other known things like what competitors are doing, how they're pricing that kind of thing. So, again I think this quarter there's a lot of noise similar to last quarter but some of the trends, some of the more macro trends are trending in favorable direction of course. Brian Nagel : Got it, thanks for all the detail. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned lower traffic and better conversion as more activity moves on line, that's been the trend. I'm curious about any updates to changes in your store staffing model that you're experimenting with and whether there's any opportunity to broaden any of those experiences to -- or experiments to change your cost structure there? Bill Nash : It is a good question Craig. In previous calls I've talked about some of the waste initiatives that we've been looking at and we've been focused on stuff that goes right into cost of goods sold and we've also been focused on stuff with SG&A and under SG&A one of the things we've been focused on is better workforce utilization. And we've made changes over the last year on how better to leverage our workforce and with technology advancements we will continue to make sure that we're taking steps to better leverage our work force. So, that's still work in progress at this point. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I have one quick question and then a real question so Katharine forgive me. The one quick question was just on the marketing spend, it looked relatively flattish year-over-year. I didn\u2019t know if that was timing or if marketing is just going to be more constrained this year in general? And then secondarily I'm just wondering if on the delivery pilots you are doing or anything related to e-commerce if the credit characteristics of the customer are any different than your in store customers? Bill Nash : Okay Sharon on the marketing spend there was some timing there so I think the way you should think about that is it'll be similar when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it should be similar on a per unit basis. So there was some timing at play there. On the delivery pilot you were asking have we seen any different mix in our credit customers? Sharon Zackfia : I'm just wondering if the credit characteristics of that customer are materially different at all from your in store customers? Tom Reedy : Yeah, generally as you look at this over time Sharon there has tended to be a little bit more skewed towards lower credit as you'd expect. People are less desiring to see heftier value saved. We don\u2019t have any -- it is not big enough a break at this point to talk about anything in that pilot. I mean things are -- it is too new because this is different. Bill Nash : Yeah and I think that what comes speaking to is more relevant to the pre-approval process not necessarily the whole delivery experience. I mean we're seeing where customers are -- the customers that would take us up on it are looking for convenience and/or they just can't physically for whatever reason get to the stores. But as far as the overall mix of customers that take that versus coming to the stores we haven't seen any big difference at this point. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thank you Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. I know you guys don't do a whole lot on the forecast side but based on everything you see are there any reasons, logical reasons in your view why used vehicle values would not assume a more normalized depreciation curve now that we're call it closing in on a year away from the all those lost vehicles from the flooding last year? Tom Reedy : Yeah, you know Scot I would like to speak to this. In this first quarter like I said in my opening remarks we did see a more normalized depreciation curve although it is starting at a much higher price point just given what happened at the end of last year with the hurricanes that kind of thing. So -- but as far as going forward I would be expecting -- I don't know, I just know that in the first quarter we've seen a return to a more normalized depreciation. Scot Ciccarelli : Understood, okay, thank you. Bill Nash : Hey Scot I do think that we would expect to continue to see the supply of vehicles from everything we understand. That's why vehicles will still continue to roll into the auction lanes which obviously will have an effect on acquisition prices. Scot Ciccarelli : That makes sense. Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is around online lead growth as I had asked about in recent quarters could you give us some commentary on whether or not you continue to have elevated [ph] lead growth online and the quality of those leads? Bill Nash : Yeah, Seth we do continue to have double-digit lead growth. Our website traffic right now, the majority of the growth is being driven by SCO which we've obviously talked about several quarters now. And the improvements that we're making there as far as the lead quality it is similar to last quarter. The mix is similar so there was no real change in the mix of leads. And the leads, specific types are performing like they have in the past whether they come online or whether they come through the store. Seth Basham : Got it and just as a follow up to that then if you're talking about a similar level of lead growth and similar level of quality what drove the improved conversion this quarter in your view? Bill Nash : Well, we did have more actual traffic. Web traffic this year and then I think the stores continue -- I talked in our opening comments about the training and the tools that we're giving associates to better enable them to progress the customer. So I think it's a combination of store execution but I do think it's also increased traffic coming to the website. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Montani from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks this is Gail Alexio [ph] on for Mike. I was wondering if you can please help us understand maybe how you think about getting the comps to accelerate with the multichannel initiatives that you have in place, maybe discuss the home delivery and appraisal, and what you learn from the pilot and how you see the bullet as to roll that out further? Bill Nash : Well, a lot in that question. Look, we are focused on driving comps. You know we are continuing to grow store base so we will grow the business that way. But we're really focused on continuing to leverage our existing footprint and reach customers in ways that we haven't previously been able to reach. So I think the initiatives that we've been working on will help us leverage our infrastructure in ways that we haven't and we should be able to continue to drive mid single-digit comp growth across the enterprise. So we feel good about that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks and maybe have you considered accelerating market penetration because there are still 40% of the country where you have no presence while maybe some of your competitors are pretty rapid at growing their footprint nationwide? Bill Nash : Yeah, so it is going to be a combination. We are very comfortable at the pace of which we're opening new stores in this 13 to 16 range because it also allows us to focus on the execution of the business. But we also feel like we can increase market penetration just through our existing footprint for the reasons I cited in the earlier question. So we're focused on both. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy at Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning guys, maybe kind of just to follow up that, I'm just thinking about the sort of installed base of stores and the online efforts, just curious if you think that there may be markets above and beyond sort of the smaller markets that you're getting into in the winter, you're talking about that might be much larger than the 600,000 MSA and just curious is there kind of a strategy here to going to smaller markets or is it just where the opportunity is right now and that as we go one, two, three years out large MSA's might make sense? And also as we think about the store base is there a potential over time to maybe call some inefficient stores and leverage your online efforts a lot more to create greater productivity in markets? Bill Nash : Yeah John, well this year we're opening up more stores and the small MSAs that's just a function of the property that we've got. You'll see us still opening up stores in larger markets to your point really reaching about 70% of the population and there's a lot of large markets that we can continue to add additional stores. So, while there have been more in small markets -- will be more in small markets this fiscal year it's a more a factor of timing and you'll see us going, continue to put more stores in larger markets in the future as well. John Murphy : And then just in the existing store base as the base develops over time would you ever consider in some markets shrinking the store base because you might be able to get a lot more efficient with your online efforts? Bill Nash : Yeah, at this point I don't see the need to do that and we obviously evaluate all our stores. We're pleased with all of our stores. You know we haven't -- we've never had to shut one, the performance has been good and keep in mind we just opened up our 192nd store so it's not like we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stores or thousands of stores. I feel really good about where the stores are placed and being able to leverage those in that infrastructure which I think is really important when you're looking to sell large volume vehicles like we do. John Murphy : Great, it is very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thank you. Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit about the wholesale business. In the last few quarters that business has done exceptionally well in terms of units and we're just trying to understand -- I know you mentioned the buy rates are up but how are you guys growing that business as much as you are with the call it the traffic in the stores and is there decoupling there that's kind of more permanent and how should we think about the wholesale business kind of growing more long-term for you guys and I used to think it was just more related to kind of the comps and measuring the traffic but just trying to think about that business for the next couple years? Bill Nash : Yeah John, the way I think about wholesale, over the long period of time wholesale and retail should grow I would say roughly similarly. Now you've seen -- you have covered this long enough that you know that in certain quarters one maybe up, one maybe down or over multiple quarters. Certainly wholesale has been. Performing very nicely which is a benefit to the diversified model when retail sales may be down wholesale may pick you up a little bit. And what I would tell you is that I think it's a factor of one, one of the things I said in the opening remarks is obviously with prices at an all time high that certainly helps us because we can continue to put more vehicle, I mean more money on the customers vehicles which bumps that buy rate up. But I would also tell you, it also goes to the execution and the improvements that we've made on making sure that we can react quickly to market, making sure that we understand the market factors quickly. So there's an execution piece at the store level where I think they're doing a better job than they have ever done. So, I don\u2019t think you should think that hey, this is always going to outgrow the retail. I think I still have the long-term view that over the long-term both of that will grow about the same. John Healy : Fair enough and just along that lines when you look at that customer that's come in are they -- is there any change in converting them at the purchasing car with you guys, is it a similar ratio or has that evolved over the last year or two any different than we've seen in the past? Bill Nash : No, that's pretty similar. John Healy : Thank you so much and great quarter. Bill Nash : Thank you John. Operator : Our next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. James Albertine : Good morning and thanks for taking my question and congratulations as well. If I may on the EPP comment that you had earlier just want to unpack a little bit what you think is driving the lower provider costs and if you can shed a little bit more detail or light on the accounting adjustment, I don't recall you mentioning the same adjustment in the fourth quarter, just want to understand kind of what's going on there with in terms of the recognition of revenues in that business? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yeah sure Jamie. And as you might imagine they're a bit intertwined. The reason that we're able to get some cost reductions from our providers on the EPP revenue is that those plans have been exceeding their expected performance from a cost kind of benefit perspective for the last several vintages I guess is the way to describe it which means that there's room to either decrease the pricing or take a little bit more margin. This quarter we realize some cost benefits, we believe we are able to take a little bit more margin for the shareholders and not impact penetration which turned out to be the case. And so that's where that growth arose from. As far as the accounting it is arriving from the new revenue recognition standard which has a very immaterial impact on our core business accounting but it does have some impact on extended planned revenues. So our vendor agreement that I referenced before provides for payments to CarMax. If the long-term performance of those plans exceeds certain thresholds and certain of those plans and certain of those vintages are exceeding this thresholds.  In the past when those payments came to us we just recorded them as when we received a check, but under the new accounting standard we have to estimate the amount that we expect to receive, record it as receivable and then true it up each quarter based on the circumstances at the time. So that $4 million that you see represents the true up of that receivable from what we learned during the quarter, during the fourth quarter. I mean I am sorry during the first quarter. And we also -- we added a minor receivable of about $13 million after tax on the balance sheet for recognition of this phenomenon if you will. So the 4 million like our loan loss reserves we will have to evaluate just on a go forward basis and we'll plan to disclose any material adjustments to that expected receivables so investors can discern which revenue relates to activity in the current period versus payments that we are getting from prior vintages. I think that will just make it a little bit more clear. But it is real dollars, it's money that we expect to collect on a cash basis, just relates to plans that are already out there and in place. James Albertine : Thank you for the detail. If I may just a clarification on the performance that you noted, it was a little bit better than the providers and yourselves perhaps we're expecting, is there any mix related driver to that -- I am just trying to get a sense of\u2026 Bill Nash : I don't think it's a mix related thing, I think it's just that an overall performance is better than they had apprised to. James Albertine : Got it, understood, thank you again. Operator : Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Armintas Sinkevicius : Good morning, thank you for taking the call. The recent performance for Carvana has been pretty incredible and I know you've invested quite a bit in the customer experience capabilities, so just curious if you could compare and contrast their approach versus the capabilities you have and if you decided to go down that path, a similar path that they have gone down what are some steps you have to do to adjust the business model or tweaks because it seems like you have many of those capabilities already in-house? Bill Nash : Like I said in my opening remarks we've been testing different pieces of the capability whether it's online finance, online appraisals and we've been doing it somewhat in isolation, somewhat in combination and now our focus is really bringing all that together in a comprehensive e-commerce package that we can roll out and continue to adapt it as the customer's expectations continue to change. So we feel really good about all that and I think it complements our existing base and our infrastructure. It allows us to provide, certainly gives us an advantage to deliver exceptional customer service whether it's online, whether they want to do a mix of the online versus in-store, or if they want to come all into the store. I don't want somebody to have to hit our website and then immediately have to decide right then I want home delivery or I don\u2019t want home delivery. I want the customers progress on their terms and if part of the way through this you don\u2019t home delivery, I want it to be an easy smooth transaction. So we are going to let the customer drive the process, however, they want to drive it versus okay we've got one solution for one type of customer and that's what we're focused on. Armintas Sinkevicius : Got it and what has been your experience with regards to the transportation of vehicles as far as the cost benefit there? Bill Nash : Well, I would tell you we are probably one of the biggest transporters of vehicles. We probably move close to 2 million cars a year. So we're very familiar with transportation. I think we have an excellent logistic system which we're heavily focused on continuing to make that even better through investments and I think that it has been and will continue to be a big differentiator for us. Armintas Sinkevicius : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Richard Nelson : Thanks and good morning. Tom, can you tell us if you are seeing any difference in website traffic or store traffic in markets where you are competing with these online home delivery concepts? Tom Reedy : Yeah Rick, so what I can tell you is if I look at the large markets where competitors are making headway I would tell you we're also making headway. So there's no direct correlation to any type of impact. We just don't see it. So again we feel good about where we are in those markets. Richard Nelson : Thanks and good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. I just want to get a little more understanding on the big picture of what went on this quarter because you're saying your comps are down due to macro pricing factors which I assume means having new vehicle incentives but used pricing was also up, so can you help me reconcile that and then kind of related maybe is there high use demand in certain vehicle segments that's skewing these pricing upward? Tom Reedy : No, I think what we have is a bit of a carryover from the spike in prices from last fall. So you have a starting higher price. We saw normal depreciation but you're starting from the higher pricing. When I say normal depreciation cycles, the year actually starts off with some appreciation because of sales that generally happen at tax time. So, that is different than what we saw last year's first quarter where it was more of a flat environment, you didn't really any appreciation. So you have a little bit of a double hit on the acquisition cost and that you still have the residual left over from what we experienced in the fall, added to that you have some appreciation that we saw from the normal seasonal appreciations/depreciation. So, that acquisition price that you mix adjusted, it is a little bit more favorable than it was the first quarter. So that's trending in the right direction. The other thing that I cited was the spread between new and used that had gotten smaller. New cars last quarter with their incentives had actually lost more value than used cars which is kind of atypical. During this quarter we started to see where that looks like that's turning back to normal where the new cars hold their value a little bit more. So there's a lot of noise going on with this for the quarter. David Whiston : Is it fair to say you're expecting pretty sharp fall offs as soon as this quarter is over due to the hurricane tailwind going away? Tom Reedy : But it's hard to say. I mean I would have thought that it would have happened a little bit quicker but considering that we had a normalized appreciation and depreciation cycle it's really hard to say. I would say to my comment earlier we think supply is going to continue to increase. If the supply continues to increase then that will continue to lower the prices of used vehicles. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning again. So my follow up question also on the used car business, we noticed continued decline in that Tier 2 penetration, recognizing that some of this is out of your hand and this reflects the market conditions. But you have recently made changes to your lending group within that pocket, so how should we think about that co-order sales going forward? Tom Reedy : Are you referring to Tier 2? Brian Nagel : That's correct. Tom Reedy : Yeah, I think we are always looking at that group. We think that we believe there's a value in having a portfolio of lenders and some of the experience we had last year and into the first quarter of last year is evidence why it's important to have a group of lenders. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments we did see a deterioration in performance. We defined performance as sales volume to the applications that that group sees or those lenders see. And so we do see deterioration performance after the first quarter of last year. Since that time it's been pretty consistent. In fact modestly better than it was in recent quarters. So on a go forward basis I can't tell you how our partners are going to behave, it's going to be depending on the marketplace and what they're seeing in their portfolio. Obviously we'll continue to pay attention to it, we will continue to try to manage and optimize it but things have been pretty stable in the last three quarters. Bill Nash : Brian, you still there. Well, I think we lost Brian. Operator are there any more questions. Operator : We have no one in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Well listen before I close I do want to take a moment to recognize Cliff Wood who has been our Chief Operations Officer. He's retiring next month, he has been with CarMax for more than 24 years. I've had the privilege to work with him for 21 of those years. He's been instrumental in building our industry leading operations, he's been a key champion for our associate-focused culture and we all wish him the best in the future. As always I also want to thank our 25,000 associates that are out there for what they do every single day, how they take care of each other, our customers and their communities and I thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in CarMax and we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Good morning and thank you, Jamie. Thank you all for joining our fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings conference call. As always, I\u2019m here with Bill Nash, our President and CEO, and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me mention that CarMax celebrated our actual 25th birthday last week. Congratulations again to our associates past and present and our millions of customers who drove our success over the years. Next, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Last as always, let me ask you in advance to only ask one question and get back in the queue for your follow-ups. We appreciate it. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you Katharine, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we were pleased to return to positive comps. Used unit comps grew by 2.1% compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter and were driven by better conversion, partially offset by lower traffic. Total used units grew by 5.8%.  Our industry continues to experience an unusual depreciation environment. In this quarter, our mix-adjusted vehicle acquisition costs remained high and were only somewhat lower than what we experienced in the first quarter. This contrasts with the prior year second quarter when our mix-adjusted vehicle acquisition costs were significantly lower year over year.  Our website traffic grew in the second quarter by 19%, up from 17% in the previous year\u2019s second quarter and 16% in the first quarter. On average, we saw volume of more than 20 million visits per month. Our retail gross profit per used unit remained stable at $2,179 compared to $2,178 last year. We had a strong wholesale quarter with units up almost 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was a result of higher appraisal traffic, the growth in our store base, and an increase in our buy rate. Our gross profit per wholesale unit decreased by about $30 to $919 in the second quarter compared to $950 in the prior year period.  Other gross profit increased by over 12%, driven by higher EPP revenue and improvement in third party finance fees. Like last quarter, EPP revenue grew with sales and benefited from provider cost decreases and approximately $4 million related to the acceleration of revenue recognition under the new accounting standard adopted at the beginning of this fiscal year. These were partially offset by lower service profits. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus 80% in the second quarter of last year, but similar to the first quarter. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were about 27%, almost exactly the same as a year ago and down slightly since the first quarter.  On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased about 12% to $454 million, or a year-over-year increase of $126 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense, including the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year, which represents a 10% growth in our base, a $7 million or 18% year-over-year increase in advertising expense which is largely due to timing, an increase of $6.5 million or $28 per unit related to share-based compensation expense, and our continuing investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning everyone. Unlike the last two quarters where we saw modest declines in the volume of credit applications, we experienced growth in applications across the credit spectrum in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to see strong lender performance in Tier 2 which accounted for 17% of sales compared with 16% last year, but we saw weaker performance in the third party Tier 3 space which represented 8.8% of used unit sales compared to 9.6% last year. CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was modestly higher than last year\u2019s second quarter at 43.9% compared to 43.5%. Our net loans originated in the quarter grew by 8.8% to $1.7 billion due to our sales growth, an increase in the average amount financed, and the slight increase in CAF penetration rate. CAF income increased 1.6% to $110 million. This was a result of the 8.6% growth in average managed receivables partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables compared to 5.8% in the second quarter of last year, but flat compared to the first quarter. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.5% compared to 7.6% a year ago and 8.4% in the first quarter.  The loan loss provision for Q2 was $40 million compared to $33 million in the prior year period. This arose from the growth in the managed receivables as well as fluctuations that are often experienced with quarterly loss provisioning. The ending allowance for loan losses was 1.13% of average managed receivables, flat sequentially from the first quarter and down from 1.15% in the second quarter of last year. Moving to capital structure, during the second quarter we continued to return capital to shareholders and repurchased 2.3 million shares for $171 million. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Tom. During the second quarter, we opened three stores : two in existing markets, including Santa Fe, which we include in the Albuquerque market, and Oklahoma City, and one in a new market Macon, Georgia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we plan to open another four stores, all in new markets for us. They include Wilmington, North Carolina, which will actually open today; Lafayette, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. As I\u2019ve done before, let me update you with some of our individual product initiatives. We recently rolled out our alternative vehicle delivery options to a second market. These options will allow customers to complete most of the vehicle shopping and purchase process from their homes after which they can decide how they want to receive the car. In addition to the Charlotte market, this is now available in all three stores in the Raleigh market. It includes our expedited or express pickup service, which kicked off in Raleigh in August, and our home delivery service, which launched in early September. In addition, we began testing an online appraisal estimator in 10 stores in August. After answering just a few questions, the online estimator provides customers with the opportunity to quickly receive an approximate offer on their vehicle. While the offer is an estimate, it is based on actual CarMax appraisal data. Also, we now have a customer experience center. This call center provides customers and test markets with support at any point along the way throughout the progression of their shopping and purchase journey. These consultants can work with the customers until they are ready to either go to the store for pickup or schedule home delivery.  Last quarter, I talked about how we are working to combine all of our online products together into one comprehensive offer. We are building a full omni-channel experience that enables customers to seamlessly move across the online and in-store experience with ease. Customers want the flexibility and independence to do much of their shopping and buying online. Given the complexity of a vehicle purchase, they also often want the help and assistance of our expert store associates at various points along the journey. We believe our ability to provide this integrated experience across both online and in-store is unique in the automotive industry. Because of our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint, brand strength, infrastructure, inventory scale, and continued investment in technology and digital capabilities, we believe we will have a clear competitive advantage to lead the industry in delivering this experience to our customers.  Later this year, we will bring this integrated omni-channel experience to a major market. This will help us learn how to best operationalize all of our offerings and scale them across the entire organization. We will provide you more information on this in the future. Now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Bill, given the success of one your online-only competitors out there, can you help us understand what the impediment has been to rolling out the alternative delivery and full digital capabilities maybe faster than what we\u2019ve seen so far? I know it\u2019s in the works, but just wondering if you can help us understand kind of the \u2013 maybe what the process impediments have been to rolling that out thus far. Bill Nash : Well Scot, it really goes back to this experience that I\u2019m talking about, this omni-channel experience. We want to make sure that we can connect all the different pieces, and so for example, the alternative delivery, whether it is home delivery or the express pick-up, that\u2019s only one small piece of the whole equation. We want to be able to combine that with all the other tests that we\u2019re doing. The other thing that we want to do is we want to make sure that our sales consultants are trained on how to continue to progress the customers in a different way than they do today.  So, I\u2019m actually pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last couple years. It\u2019s a big change for the organization, there\u2019s a lot of technology involved, and I think we\u2019re on the right track. So, I\u2019m excited about it. Scot Ciccarelli : Maybe if I were to rephrase the question a little bit then, if you roll it out to this major market that you\u2019re expecting in the back half and you like what you see, how quickly could it be rolled out from that point into other markets? Bill Nash : We\u2019ll wait and see on that, Scot. I mean the plan would be once we get it into market, we\u2019ll obviously want to iterate quickly on that, and so that\u2019s what our focus will be. Our first focus is to get in the market, and the second one will be to iterate it quickly from there, because I think what you\u2019ll see is the first version of it will not be the end state. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I guess a follow-up question on the omni-channel paradigm. As you think about that going forward, and I know you\u2019re still early, can you talk about what the targeted margin profile would be for a car that would be delivered versus picked up? Are you looking to maintain that gross profit per car, or how do you think about that? Secondarily, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever given any metrics in Charlotte about the number of customers that actually choose to get delivery or inquire about delivery. Is there any metric you can give us on what you\u2019re seeing in Charlotte? Bill Nash : Okay, on the first question, Sharon, it is a little early to talk about the cost profile and the structure. We\u2019re still learning. As I\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got a call center there opening up. I think there\u2019s opportunity and we\u2019re testing different opportunity on compensation structure, so I think there\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019re continuing to work through, so I can\u2019t really give you any guidance on that at this point.  As far as the number of customers, you\u2019re correct - we haven\u2019t talked about that, but the majority of customers by far still want to interact with our expert sales consultants and still want to come into the store at some point. The key is that we want to make sure that we individualize each customer\u2019s journey and help them at the points that they need help so that it\u2019s not one size fits all. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : Thanks so much, and good morning. I\u2019d like to ask a question on CAF. So, the interest spread, I think essentially stabilized sequentially. I know that the last securitization, I saw a little bit of a better spread than the prior one, but generally speaking the spreads on your securitizations have been coming down as the pace of increasing your cost of funds has moved a little bit faster than the average rate you\u2019ve been able to charge, even as that\u2019s been moving higher. How is it that that spread was able to stabilize as you\u2019re still essentially mixing towards, I think, those lower spread securitizations? Tom Reedy : Matt, it\u2019s stabilized quarter over quarter, but it\u2019s still a little bit down versus last year. In general, as I\u2019ve talked about, we in reaction to interest rate increases immediately start testing, so you\u2019re naturally going to see a little bit of a lag, I think, in our ability to increase rates in response to benchmarks rising. But if I look back at what benchmarks have done over the last year, they\u2019re up a little over 100 basis points, and if you look at what we\u2019re charging customers in this quarter versus a year ago, it\u2019s up a little under 100 basis points, so I think we\u2019ve been successful in migrating rates up. We\u2019ve kept an eye on the three-day payoffs, which have been very stable this year. When we first starting increasing rates, we saw a little bit of a tick up in that, but I think it\u2019s normalized now. You know, the reality is it just takes some time to respond to rate increases. We\u2019re not going to preemptively increase rates on a prediction that rates are going to go up, so I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of moving things up, but in an increasing rate environment, you\u2019re naturally going to see a little bit of lag there. Matt Fassler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. My question centers on the used car business. Clearly with a two-one comp, like you said Bill in your prepared comments, it returned to positive comps, but what\u2019s encouraging there is even on a stacked basis, it\u2019s stronger on both two and three years. I want to understand better from your perspective what\u2019s happening in the overall environment. You talked a bit about used car pricing - it sounds like that\u2019s still a headwind, so maybe elaborate further on that, and then, are there other factors out there that are helping drive better sales, and how do we think about the sustainability of those factors for the back half of this year? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes Brian, I\u2019ve been here a long time and it\u2019s a very unusual market right now. As I\u2019ve said in my opening remarks, acquisition costs are still, when you look at a year-over-year basis, much higher than they were a year ago, and we had a little bit of an offset on acquisition prices because our inventory that we sold skewed to be a little bit older, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the increase in acquisition prices. At the end of the first quarter, we were starting to see--although your starting point of prices was higher, at the end of the first quarter we were starting to see depreciation trends more normalized. It really stopped after the end of the first quarter. Second quarter, we\u2019ve seen unusual depreciation curves - in other words, normally you\u2019d see continued depreciation during this time of year, and we just really didn\u2019t see that. It\u2019s very different than in past years - it\u2019s been very flat. I think there\u2019s probably, and this is just my belief, some of what\u2019s driving that may be anticipation of tariffs on new cars and people speculating and trying to buy up used cars; but to be honest with you, I don\u2019t really know why that is. New car prices are obviously still as high as ever and they continue to go up, so as far as the outlook going forward, I would think at some point we would start to see depreciation trends more normalize, even if your cost is at a higher starting price. I would think that we\u2019d start to see it more normalize, especially as continued inventory comes in off of the lease increases that we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Brian Nagel : On that, so with the hurricane [indiscernible] we recently saw hit the east coast, could that further exacerbate the pricing dynamic within the used market? Bill Nash : It\u2019s hard to tell. I think the industry so far is saying that this is not from a destruction of automobiles, this is not to the magnitude of, say, Harvey was. I think I saw some estimates of maybe 20,000 vehicles or so, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see to the magnitude that we did a year ago. Brian Nagel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is on the hurricane impacts on sales. Last year, I think you had some negative impact on your sales at the end of the second quarter and some positive impact in the third. How do we think about that from a year-over-year perspective this year, considering Hurricane Flo? Can you give us some color there, please? Bill Nash : Yes, so as far as the hurricanes last year, you\u2019re right - it really impacted us only the last week of the quarter, so the real impact is next quarter. As far as Flo goes, we\u2019ll talk more about that because it happened in the third quarter, but I will tell you we did have a period of time where we had several stores shut down, but we as an organization fared very well from a property standpoint. The stores and the inventory, we did not see some of the impacts that we saw last year. Keep in mind, when we have these weather events, generally it\u2019s the timing and then we\u2019ll get the sales back afterwards. Seth Basham : Did you pull forward the opening of the Wilmington store to capitalize on potential demand in that market? Bill Nash : Actually, we delayed the Wilmington because it was supposed to open up pretty much right in the mix of the hurricane prep, so we delayed it, which is why it\u2019s opening today. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I can appreciate, having been done in Virginia, the capabilities that you have in-house and continue to develop, and that you can transport cars the same way as Carvana can. I\u2019m curious - what do you think it will take for the market to realize that your capabilities are similar? Do you think it will be the launch of the bundled offers? Just curious on your thoughts there. Bill Nash : I don\u2019t know, I mean, we\u2019re focused on making sure that we deliver this omni-channel. We understand that customers want to do more online, and like I said earlier, the complexity that\u2019s involved with used cars, we feel like there is points in that process where the customer wants assistance, so that\u2019s our focus. Our focus is on right now delivering the omni-channel, and we\u2019ll see how the market responds after that. Armintas Sinkevicius : What are your market shares in the Carvana markets, and how has that changed? Bill Nash : We don\u2019t speak specifically to individual competitors. We view our competitive set as much broader than, say, digital type players, and again we\u2019re focused on all competitors. Just like we don\u2019t talk about geographic differences, we won\u2019t speak to competitor differences. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, you mentioned rolling out the online appraisal tool in more markets. I\u2019m curious, in those pilots, how accurate have those online appraisals proven to be? Bill Nash : Actually Craig, let me clarify a little bit. What I talked about in the opening remarks was the estimator - that\u2019s a different tool than what we\u2019re testing. We have several tests going on. One is the estimator, which is the new one, which is just a series of simple questions a customer can fill out, we give them an estimate. In the markets where we\u2019re doing online appraisals, we have several different versions of that, that we\u2019re testing as well. What we\u2019ve found is that we can be very accurate on the online appraisal offers. What we\u2019re really trying to figure out is what\u2019s the best delivery mechanism for those, what\u2019s the best process for individual customers, and how we communicate those offers. With some customers, depending on the vehicles, there may be different solutions, so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been testing several different things and continue to test several different things. Craig Kennison : Could you just remind me of the difference between an estimate and an appraisal? Bill Nash : Sure. The estimate is just what I said - it\u2019s an estimate offer that still has to be brought to the store or leveraged through our online appraisal offer. The online appraisal offer is one that we will back, assuming that the customer didn\u2019t oversee some type of condition that impacts the vehicle. Craig Kennison : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, Bill, for your thoughts around potential impacts from tariffs, to the extent that we were to see those happen. How do you see that playing out for your business and the industry a little bit more broadly? Bill Nash : I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but obviously the tariffs on new cars would certainly cause the new car prices to go up, and then you\u2019d have to look at what that did to the gap between new cars and late model used cars. I would think that that would widen, which I think would be helpful for our business. The other thing that we\u2019d have to stay tuned on is really the parts and things that we use in our reconditioning process, so we\u2019re staying close to it and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it as it progresses. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James Albertine : Great, thank you, and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the EPP side, if possible. I know there is some cost benefit that you alluded to in the press release, and there\u2019s an accounting adjustment there, a benefit; but wanted to get the sense on the unit side, given the zero to four-year-old mix fell, are you seeing attachment actually increase, because I would imagine that would be a factor driving monthly payments higher and so make the comp performance look even better in that regard. Tom Reedy : Jamie, we\u2019ve seen pretty darn consistent EPP attach rates over the years, and that was part of the reason we were able to take a little bit more margin with the cost reductions from our competitors in lieu of passing it onto customers in the form of lower prices earlier this year, because we\u2019ve seen that elasticity and it\u2019s come through. We haven\u2019t seen a reduction in our attach rate at all. With regard to the accounting standard, that\u2019s something that we have to look at every quarter now. We have to put a receivable on the books for those retro payments that we\u2019re entitled to based on the contracts, and every quarter we\u2019ll look at it and we\u2019ll make an estimation of what we believe has changed and what we expect to collect on some of those plans.  One thing that I think might be helpful to point out, though, is the methodology that we use to predict that receivable includes some seasoning of the plans before they\u2019re going to get put into the consideration set, so that every quarter we\u2019ll be looking at additional plans that have seasoned to the point where they\u2019re worth looking at and making assessments based on that. The thing could move either direction, but one dynamic I think it\u2019s important to know is there are new plans being put into the consideration set every quarter, and in recent years, as I talked about last quarter, we\u2019ve seen over-performance for the vendors in those plans and we\u2019ve been expecting to get a payback. James Albertine : So just a point of clarification, you\u2019d expect with older vehicles that the attachment rate would fall, I would imagine, and so if we were to, say, see a surge in zero to four-year-old vehicle demand in the coming quarters, being flat now, arguably you might even see an uptick from here. Is that fair? Tom Reedy : I mean, I don\u2019t have the data in front of me, but I would think the opposite would be, off the top of my head, true. The newer vehicles still have some of their manufacturer\u2019s warranty left on them, and frankly the older vehicles, the EFP is a better value proposition for the customer because it\u2019s going to protect them when they don\u2019t have a warranty. James Albertine : Understood. Great, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just a question as we think about the competitive dynamics in the market, and you kind of talked about this a little bit but I wanted to put it all together. Are there any specific markets where competitive is being disruptive, or any markets you can point to that you\u2019re being disruptive? What I\u2019m trying to get at here is there is an increasing focus by the new vehicle dealers, there\u2019s obviously some digital competitors that are out there, but at the same time as you launch your omni-channel efforts and kind of really coalesce what you\u2019re doing online and within home delivery, you might be disruptive. I\u2019m just trying to understand the competitive dynamics and if you can give us any examples in markets where you see market share shifts or opportunities. It just seems there\u2019s a lot going on right now, and you\u2019re probably going to be one of the big winners but I think there\u2019s a lot of concern out there. Bill Nash : Yes John, you\u2019re right - the competition is robust from a lot of different angles, whether it\u2019s digital players, whether it\u2019s brick and mortar players, standalone players, that kind of thing, and we\u2019re focused on all of them. I\u2019m not going to talk specifically about any particular markets because I can tell you, it\u2019s a very complicated analysis when you try to dial into an individual market, looking at all the different competitive sets that are there, what are those competitors doing, what are we doing differently, you have to take into consideration age of our stores. There\u2019s a whole bunch of things that you have to look at. What I would just tell you is that we\u2019re really positioning ourselves to be that solution for the customer, allowing the customer to really drive the transaction on their terms, individualize every single customer interaction. That\u2019s what our focus is on and less so about, okay, what\u2019s this one player doing. We think that this omni-channel solution is going to be the future of where customers want to go. John Murphy : Maybe just a really quick follow-up. When you think about that competition and the ramp-up and the focus on this specific channel in the market, or used vehicles in the market, is the upward pressure on pricing because of that, or is it because of the end market consumer, meaning is there an increasing acceptance that maybe lower grosses by this increasing competition might be what\u2019s driving up the used vehicle pricing in a way that just seems very counterintuitive to supply and demand in normal depreciation curves? Bill Nash : Yes, the way I think about it, John, is look - I feel very good about our pricing and the competitiveness of our pricing. As you know, we look at it all the time, we test it all the time. I think what happens is because there is a focus from a lot of different areas, there is in any given market probably some confusion out there because a lot of different competitors are advertising, so I think there\u2019s some confusion there. But I\u2019m less worried about the pricing at this point because there\u2019s a lot of different things that we can do to improve our price without, say, changing what our gross profit per unit is. I think more right now, there\u2019s just a lot of awareness out there, or confusion out there of a bunch of different competitors. John Murphy : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Your line is open. Nick Zangler : Hey guys, Nick Zangler in for Rick here. More of a strategic question. From your early findings, can you talk about the importance for a customer to physically see a vehicle in person before they commit to a purchase - what\u2019s your view there? Then related, I think the value of delivery in general could be debated, but do you foresee a capability that allows a customer to conduct virtually the entire vehicle transaction online and simply come into the store, verify the vehicle condition and pick it up there, and does the consumer desire that capability as well? Thanks. Bill Nash : Okay, so on your first question, do they want to see the car? Absolutely, the majority of our customers want to see the car. On your second question, the value of delivery - listen, what you described is what we\u2019re talking about when we say expedited or express delivery. That\u2019s our first attempt into that foray, where the customer can do most everything online and then they come into the store just to test drive it, if they want to test drive it, understand what the options are. Again, the customer will determine how much time they want to be in the store. If they want to be in and out in 15 minutes, they can be out in 15 minutes. If they want to take it for a test drive, obviously it will be a little bit longer than that. But most of what we see on the customer side is that they still want to see and, in a lot of cases, test drive the vehicle. Nick Zangler : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Paige with Gabelli. Your line is open. Matthew Paige : Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask potentially a longer term question. Obviously fully these are a small but growing piece of the U.S. market, but have you learned any lessons or how to make any changes to your CarMax appraisal system to deal with those kinds of vehicles that might have a potentially different depreciation schedule? Bill Nash : I\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re asking, Matthew. Matthew Paige : EVs, I don\u2019t have a historical basis for how your appraisal system likely does other kinds of cars. How have you dealt with new entries into the market? Bill Nash : Yes, so if you\u2019re talking specifically, let\u2019s say EVs, obviously I think the industry as a whole would have thought that EV sales would have been a bigger percentage as compared to where it is today. That being said, we do get EVs through the appraisal lane, we buy them offsite Because of our data set, because we look at so many cars both in the appraisal lane and offsite, we\u2019ve honed that muscle as well, just like with the traditional cars. So far, even though it\u2019s a small subset, we feel very comfortable in being able to price that type of vehicle, and again because of the data that we have and the number of vehicles that we look at on a weekly basis, we learn very quickly and then we can react to those learnings. Matthew Paige : Great, I appreciate you taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. My question is on the digital omni-channel and the whole ecommerce platform that you\u2019ve been working on. Have there been some real big challenges in states where the laws are really behind the times tech-wise, and do you think those issues are resolved? If you can just talk about those issues a bit, thanks. Bill Nash : I think from a regulatory standpoint, there\u2019s a couple different things. Some states still require that vehicle sales occur at the dealership\u2019s physical location and that the customer has to actually visit the dealership - we call that darkening the door. Other states, you have to have a physical location but you don\u2019t necessarily have to have the customer come in and do the transaction in the store, and then other states obviously are more liberal and you don\u2019t have to have either one of those requirements. As we continue to work through this, we\u2019ll obviously make sure that we follow any applicable laws, and again our goal is to meet the customer on their terms and we\u2019ll do that in a legal way. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jacob Moser with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi everyone, this is Chris Bottiglieri at Wolfe Research. I had a couple questions--well, one with a follow-up, to follow Katharine\u2019s rules. Given the store traffic was challenged but you saw higher appraisal traffic, can you maybe just connect the two? Are you starting to see the [indiscernible] improve or some of your digital efforts driving increased appraisal traffic, if you could talk about that? Bill Nash : Yes, I think the appraisal traffic is probably a combination of things, whether it\u2019s some of the stuff that we\u2019re doing - marketing online. I also think it\u2019s a very favorable pricing environment where, as I talked about earlier, acquisition prices are higher, we can put more money on people\u2019s vehicles, and when you can do that, that certainly helps your buy rate. On the opposite side, if there\u2019s a depreciating market, that generally hurts your buy rate a little bit. So I think a lot of it is based off the environment that we\u2019re in, in addition to a lot of other things that we\u2019re working on. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. As a follow-up, I assume it\u2019s connected, can you just give an update on your self-sufficiency ratio and how that\u2019s been trending more recently? Bill Nash : Sure. Self-sufficiency, we\u2019ve typically talked about the range, 40 to 50%, and right now we\u2019re in the lower end of that range. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you, okay. Thank you for the help, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, just a follow-up question. I know market share data is hard to get until you get to an annual basis, but how do you feel like you\u2019re likely to shape up this year? Do you feel like you are continuing to gain share in the marketplace? Then secondarily, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about disruption in the marketplace, and you\u2019ve been a disruptor over the years as well. I guess I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen anything particularly in Atlanta, which is where Carvana\u2019s oldest market is. Bill Nash : Okay, you\u2019re going to be disappointed, Sharon, on both of your questions. The first one on the market share, to your point, when you look at it in the short term, it\u2019s not as valid, which is why we look at it on an annual basis. As you probably recall, last time we reported on it, it was last year\u2019s calendar year which we saw one of our biggest comp market share gains that we\u2019ve seen in a while. I don\u2019t have any updates on that front at this point. The other thing as far as disruption in a specific market, again I really don\u2019t want to get into talking about any individual markets or, for that fact, any individual competitor. Our competitive set is huge, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019re focused on overall competition. I know neither of those answers are satisfying to you, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for you. Sharon Zackfia : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey guys, just wanted to follow up on maybe an alternative revenue channel and just get your thoughts here. When you think about the growth and maturation we\u2019re seeing from Uber and Lyft and then some of the partners they have, like a hire car or a fare, I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide any updates or thinking about the potential growth opportunity in that channel, just because it would seem potentially to be substantial. Bill Nash : Michael, what I\u2019d say is, look - I think that this is an exciting time to be in the automotive industry just outright because of so many different things that are changing. I think there\u2019s lots of opportunities for CarMax, and I would tell you, I wouldn\u2019t take anything off the plate at this point. We\u2019re constantly looking at the business and how we can continue to improve, as well as make sure that we plan for the future as the business changes.  I would just tell you, we\u2019re pretty much open to a lot of different options, and we\u2019re working with some different strategic partners trying to do different things. When we have something material to talk about, we\u2019ll talk about it at that point. Michael Montani : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me back on. I have a couple follow-ups on the numbers. The first relates to ASP. Your new car ASP--I\u2019m sorry, your used ASPs were up slightly year-on-year, and that would be consistent presumably with what we saw in the market broadly. Your wholesale ASPs, I guess were under a tad of pressure--not pressure per se, but just down a little bit. What was going on in the wholesale ASP realm in terms of mix that was different from what was transpiring in the market more broadly? Bill Nash : Yes, if you mix-adjust the wholesale, our prices--because it is a stronger market, our prices actually went up, but we did have a mix shift where we had more older cars which generally will bring the price down as well as the mix, we had some more compacts come through which will change the pricing as well. You have different factors going in different directions. Then on the used side, again acquisition price was higher and it was partially offset by the shift into older vehicles. Matt Fassler : Understood. Then the follow-up relates to your other overhead spend. There\u2019s been a lot of talk on this call about innovation, and presumably a lot of the things you\u2019re doing, presumably the way that manifests in the P&L in any given quarter is the other overhead line, and I think you alluded to that in your press release. That spend was up 24%, which is as big as it\u2019s been since late \u201916, and about as big an increase as you\u2019ve typically had.  I know you don\u2019t guide on a go-forward basis, but should we expect that this line item remains a big focus for you as you potentially accelerate some of the innovation on your end? Bill Nash : Well, keep in mind a couple things. The total SG&A was up. Part of that was because of the advertising and the timing of the advertising. In the other category, where we do have some investments in our strategic initiatives, I\u2019ve said all along this year that we\u2019re continuing to invest and put back into the business, and I think some of the increase that you saw there - there\u2019s some consulting, there\u2019s some contracting, there\u2019s software as a service - some of those things will stick around, some of those things will go away as certain projects come to completion, that kind of thing. So I think there is some timing in there, but again this is a year that I\u2019ve said all along that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the organization. Matt Fassler : Totally understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi guys. I don\u2019t think you had enough CAF questions just yet, so I had one. I think during Tom\u2019s brief remarks earlier, he referenced weaker performance in the Tier 3 space. I guess I was wondering, is that just referencing the mix being down a touch, or did you actually see tighter lending standards there? Tom Reedy : No, I guess I wasn\u2019t clear enough. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw application volume up pretty much across the spectrum in all credit grades. It may have been a little more robust in the middle space where the Tier 2 is, but it was up across the board. The degradation in Tier 3 resulted--you know, it was a combination of increased volume but a decrease in the performance by the lender, so we\u2019ve seen conversion in the Tier 3 space over the course of the quarter actually deteriorate, and that\u2019s-- Scot Ciccarelli : So if it deteriorates during the quarter, does that suggest maybe that will continue as we roll into third quarter, then? Tom Reedy : Well, we\u2019ll see how that progresses. We\u2019ve talked about--we\u2019ve got a number of lenders in there, it\u2019s one in particular. We\u2019re looking at our alternatives and as third quarter materializes, we\u2019ll tell you how it went. But obviously we\u2019re looking at it carefully. Scot Ciccarelli : Understood, thank you. Operator : Again that\u2019s star, one if you would like to ask a question.  Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : I also have a question on CAF for you, as it relates to the lending outlook, the tightening that we\u2019ve seen at the subprime level. Do you think that\u2019s indicative of something we might see on a wider basis going forward, and as it relates to your CAF portfolio loss rate performance specifically, how would you characterize that right now? We\u2019re seeing it tick up a little bit more than historical seasonal averages. Would you expect it to maintain the current level, or do you expect it to increase a little bit going forward? Tom Reedy : I\u2019ll start with your second question, Seth. We\u2019re not seeing anything in our Tier 3 lending that is surprising us, so--obviously it\u2019s a different animal than what we do in the prime space and a different customer relationship, different expected losses, but we haven\u2019t seen anything there that has given us any pause. As I mentioned, it\u2019s really performance by one lender, so I can\u2019t speculate on whether it\u2019s something that could be global in the future. That\u2019s why we have multiple partners, because different institutions have different credit committees, they get different leadership at different points in their evolution, and they can change their mind about how they want to behave. Seth Basham : Okay, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining the call today. As Katharine mentioned when she first started out, it was our 25th anniversary as a company last week, and that truly is a testament to our associates. I\u2019m once again reminded why our associates are a differentiator for CarMax, and it\u2019s because of the way they live our values with each other, our customers, and the communities. I want to thank them all for everything they do. They have absolutely been the key to our success in the past, and they will continue to be the key to our success in the future.  Thanks for your time and interest in CarMax, and we will talk to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Amy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fiscal Year 2019 Third Quarter CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thanks you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. I\u2019m here today with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, filed with the SEC. Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking one question getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, used unit comps fell by 1.2% compared to a positive 2.7% in the prior quarter. This is driven by lower traffic largely offset by better conversions. Total used units grew by 2.3%. We are pleased to report a 10% increase in pre-tax income. This is a testament to the strength of our diversified business model. While we are disappointed to report negative comps in the quarter, they were materially affected by the dynamics in the six Houston-area stores following Hurricane Harvey. Remember, the hurricane positively impacted our results in the third quarter of last fiscal year. If we exclude the impact of the Houston market this quarter, the company experienced positive comps of 2.3%. Our website traffic grew in the third quarter by 17%. On average, we saw a volume of about 20 million visits per month. Our retail gross profit per used unit remains stable at $21.33 compared to $21.48 last year. Once again, we had a strong wholesale quarter with units up 10% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. This was a result of the growth in our store base, and an increase in our buy rate. Our gross profit per wholesale unit was similar year-over-year, $949 this quarter compared to $933 in the prior year period. Other gross profit increased by over 16%, again, driven by higher EPP revenue and improvement in our third-party finance fees. EPP revenue is expanded by 11%, primarily as a result of provider cost decreases that we discussed previously. During the quarter, we did not recognize any additional extended service plan revenue associated with the new accounting standards. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus 81% in the third quarter of last year, but were similar to the second quarter. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 45% of our sales, up from 42% this time last year. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased 2.5% to $410 million or a year-over-year of $5 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense, including our continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives and the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of third quarter of last year, which represents an 11% growth in our store base. These are partially offset by a decrease of $7 million or $42 per unit related to share-based compensation expense. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. During the quarter, we saw slight decline in year-over-year credit applications. Our Tier 2 lenders continued to deliver strong performance accounting for 18.3% of used unit sales compared with 15.4% last year. Q3 penetration was 9.3% compared to 10.8% last year. During the quarter, we made some changes to the routing of Tier 3 apps. An overall conversion of these applications, which is how we judge performance, ended up in line with last year's third quarter. CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was consistent with last year\u2019s third quarter at 44%. Our net loans originated in the quarter grew by 3.4% to $1.5 billion due to our sales growth and the increase in the average amount financed. CAF income increased 6.7% to $110 million. This was a result of the 8.4% growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.6% of average managed receivables compared to 5.7% in both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. The provision for loan losses was $41 million compared to $38 million in last year's third quarter. This increase is in line with our growth in average managed receivables. Our loans originated during the quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.5% versus 7.7% a year ago. And this number was consistent again with the second quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 1.12% of any managed receivables similar to last quarter and to last year's third quarter as well. Lastly, I'll touch on capital structure. During the third quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $254 million. And as you may have seen in the 8-K we filed in October, CarMax's Board of Directors also authorize a $2 billion expansion in the current repurchase program. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks, Tom. During the third quarter, we opened four stores in new markets for CarMax, Wilmington, North Carolina; Lafayette, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. In the fourth quarter, we plan to open another five stores. Two stores open earlier in December, one in Buffalo, which is the new market, and one in Melbourne, Florida, which we opened this week. This is our fourth store in the Orlando market, and our 200th store overall. Later in the fourth quarter, we will open two more stores in new markets, Montgomery, Alabama; and New Orleans. We will also open our third store in the Portland, Oregon market. Early this month, we announced the launch of our new omni-channel experience in the Atlanta market. Atlanta is our oldest large market and has a high CarMax brand awareness and market share. In addition, we see an opportunity to reach more customers within the perimeter of the city by offering alternative vehicle delivery options. Our extensive testing and research has shown us that customers' expectations are changing. Buying a car is still a complex process, and customers are looking for an experience that give them more control and independence in buying and selling a car. However, they also want advice and guidance at any point in the journey. That is why we've developed the omni-channel experience that delivers upon this unmet customer need. The launch in Atlanta provides an experience that is flexible, convenient and fully personalized. In addition to our great in-store experience, customers can complete some or all the car buying process from home, including finance, appraisal, and paperwork. They can have their vehicle delivered directly to home or work and test drive before buying. There's no requirement for customers to purchase prior to having the vehicle delivered. Customers can also receive help from informed CarMax consultants both in-person at our stores or through our customer experience center via phone, text or e-mail. Last quarter, we shared that we opened our first center in Raleigh that now supports our Atlanta area customers. Consultants in the center are available to help customers find their ideal vehicle, navigate financing and provide any support needed until they are ready to either go to the store for pickup or schedule a home delivery. We also introduced a new express pickup option at all Atlanta-area locations giving the customer the ability to save time by completing most of the process online and then finalizing their purchase at the store in as little as 30 minutes. In December, we opened our first standalone CarMax Express in Atlanta, which serves as an additional convenient location for test drives, appraisals and express pickup of vehicle purchases. Finally, we launched a completely new website experience for Atlanta. The new online experience provides a modern and fresh brand look and includes enhanced, simplicity and flexibility for shopping and buying that easily transitions to a home delivery or in-store experience. We are excited to put the customer in the driver's seat. This experience is a unique and powerful integration of our own in-store and online capabilities. Keep in mind, we will continue to improve both the customer and associate experience in Atlanta and use these learnings to inform how we rollout into other markets. As we previously announced, we anticipate having the omni-channel experience available to the majority of our customers by February 2020. To expand omni-channel, we anticipate opening additional customer experience centers. We're currently in the process of planning the next locations, while taking state regulations into consideration. In terms of cost implications, we will continue to invest, but still expect to leverage SG&A at the upper end of a mid-single digit comp range. While there are incremental costs and inefficiencies in the near term, we've also identified potential cost savings through process changes and other improvements that can help offset these expenses over time. We believe that no other company is in a better position to deliver the best experience efficiently and profitably. While it is early, we are pleased with the feedback on omni-channel from both our customers and associates, has been very positive, and that the experience is highly representative of the CarMax brand. Let me remind you, we got into this industry in 1993 in order to provide an exceptional customer experience. We have never wavered from this commitment, which is why we've led the industry for more than 25 years. It is absolutely a part of our DNA. We believe we have a clear advantage to continue to lead the automotive industry and delivering a truly integrated and seamless experience both online and in-store. This advantage is enabled by continuing to leverage our strengths, including our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint and transportation infrastructure, our inventory scale and merchandising capabilities, our continued investment in technology and digital capabilities and our industry leading brand. All of these factors combined will allow us to deliver an unmatched experience that we believe will be the future of car buying. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Brian Nagel : Congrats on the launch in Atlanta. Bill Nash : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So I wanted to ask my one question. I just wanted to focus on the comps trend. And you gave us a nice color there with regard to the impact of the Huston boost last year. So the question I have is -- the one when we look at Huston, could you help us understand better when that happened? How that -- when that happened in the quarter? Was there also some type of benefit in the prior quarter? And then recognizing you don't give or provide guidance. But as we look into the fiscal fourth quarter, we're now cycling pass a negative eight. So how should we think about the trade rate a bit -- the trend of business against that negative eight. So is it as simple as that is now is a very easy comparison? Or is it something that other servicing corpse we should think about when modeling against that number? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, Brian, let me first -- so let\u2019s talk a little bit about Houston. So if you remember last year, in the third quarter, we did recognize and call out that the comps were driven by the performance in the Houston market. And truthfully, we feel like we did an unbelievable job leveraging our strengths, our infrastructure, our transportation network to get vehicles down there to customers that needed them. And we facilitated through reductions in transportation and a lot of free transfer. So that obviously gave us a boost last year. That\u2019s why we -- and we called it out last year, we call it out again this year. I think one of the things I didn\u2019t have in my opening remarks is that, I think it\u2019s still interesting to notice. We\u2019re still experiencing a very unusual pricing environment. And really, since the Hurricanes, prices have been elevated. And it's started in last year\u2019s third quarter, if you remember. But even as recently this quarter that we just finished, there are some interesting pricing dynamics that in part of the quarter, we saw some flat to maybe a slight appreciation, which you normally don\u2019t see this time of year. So I think there\u2019s some pricing dynamics that are coming into play, which also impacts the new versus late model used car gap, which has been fairly consistent. It\u2019s little bit up, little bit down. I would say from what we can tell is fairly consistent. So I think those factors are playing into what we\u2019re seeing right now as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC. Scot, your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : So Bill, you guys are launching your digital strategy or omni-channel strategy in Atlanta. And I would think that should help level of point view [ph] again some of your online competitors. But how do you expect to improve CarMax's pricing or positioning from a value perspective through the marketplaces like CarGurus. I mean, they have -- CarGurus, if you look at them, they have something like 5.5 million vehicles on their site, lot of dealers are using them. And if you do a scan of kind of CarMax vehicles through CarGurus window, if you will, CarMax doesn\u2019t show up as with a lot of great deals and good deals the way they segmented. And how do you guys plan to or do you plan to try and address that challenge, if you will? Bill Nash : Okay. Scot, yes, let me first just talk a little bit about our pricing. I mean you follow us for a long time. We\u2019re very focused on the price and how it compares to all the competitors. I mean, after all, you can\u2019t sell more than 700,000 cars a year with uncompetitive prices. And we look at those pricing in a bunch of different ways with this mark-to-market versus competitors versus wholesale prices. And we\u2019re constantly doing some pricing elasticity test. Now in regards to CarGurus, there\u2019s lots of vehicle listing services out there. And I think those sites have made it easier for dealers to get their cars out there and view that. And I think they made it easier for consumers to search. Absolutely, they\u2019ve done that. We use some of the listing services to complement our website, which is really kind of an economic exercise for us if that gives us the right ROI. The one thing on the listing site is they aren\u2019t always good, maybe for research, for example, being able to compare the quality of the car. So I think that scenario where we can continue to make sure that we do a better job calling out not only the quality of our cars, but the value adds of the options that we have and change up our messing a little bit and change up our merchandising the way we have it on the website, and continue to work with the listing companies to help call out the quality because not every car on those listing sites -- they're all very different. And so -- at times it does make it difficult to compare because the quality of the car just may not be the same. Scot Ciccarelli : So specifically, how do you plan to change that or change whether it's on the marketplace or like -- is it a pricing change? Is it some sort of messaging or marketing like, I guess I'm just curious in terms of broad picture, how do you plan to change it? Bill Nash : Yes, as far as the pricing change, look, like I talked about earlier, we're looking at prices all time, we think we're very competitive. There's a lots been written about our pricing highlights to the competitors. And what I would encourage folks to do is if you go out and do the analysis and make sure that you truly do an apples-to-apples comparison, not just look at make model but look at make model trim with the options and mileage stands, what you'll find is that we're very competitive. In a lot of cases we beat competitors and in some cases we're less than competitors. And the difference that you're talking about is not that significant. But as far as getting that price perception out there, I think we can do at a combination of ways in both how we merchandise our vehicles on the website and calling attention to whether it's options that are on certain cars and what value that adds or reconditioning that we've done to the car was specific value-adds of what's been put into that car. So I think it's going to be also -- it also be a combination of how we advertise the quality message in addition to working with some of the listing agencies that we work with to figure out how to call it out a little bit better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon, your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : I guess I wanted to ask a question about the kind of a longer-term algorithm for CarMax, which I think, historically had kind of been based on that 4 to 7 comp. And I think you just mentioned earlier that you need to be kind of at the higher end of the mid-single digit to leverage SG&A. But when I look over the last five years, you guys only kind of hit that 4 to 7, maybe once or twice on an annual basis. Is there something happening where you think 4 to 7 is not the right number going forward either investments being made in the business, where you think there is a reacceleration and sustainable comp going forward? I'm just trying to reconcile the last five years with that longer-term guidance? Bill Nash : Yes, Sharon. So if you go back to FY '17 and FY '18, and both those years -- half of the quarters were in that range, in the 5 to 8 range. We saw it slow down last year when you get to the third quarter with the hurricane in the marketplace spike. I still believe at longer-term, that's absolutely a target that we should be shooting for. And I think things like making sure that we have the best experience and put the customer in the driver seat with things like omni-channel, I think will help to continue us to get there. Sharon Zackfia : Can I ask a follow-up for that? I mean, do you feel like -- so oftentimes when you see the comps flow like that or you're hitting the target half the time, the competitive gap may have narrowed vis-a-vis the others. And I know on imagery, maybe you're a little bit behind on the internet you're catching up there. Are there any particular areas of focus that kind of lighten that gap for CarMax relative to the competition again? Bill Nash : Yes, look, I think in any given quarter, I mean, the competition is absolutely robust. It's been robot for a while. Look, we're in a great industry, and we would always expect competition and now certainly is no different. I think sometimes the competition is rational, sometimes it may be a little irrational. As far as specific things, I think, our whole investment that we've been doing over the last couple years is both in our website, in our associate systems, in the experience that we're giving to the customer. That's what we've been focused on to continue to make sure we lead the industry. And I would say that's what our near-term focus is on because we do see customers wanting a better experience. We have a great in-store experience and the folks -- and make sure we're all clear. The majority of our customers still want to come into the store at this point. But we're seeing the trend where a lot of customers want to do more and be equipped and empowered on their own, but they still want the help. They just want it on their terms and their timing and that's what we're really focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig, your line is open. Craig Kennison : Question is on your advertising message. With the omni-channel rollout underway, does CarMax need to change its advertising message to tell that story? And specifically, what are you doing in Atlanta with respect to advertising to get that omni-channel message out? Bill Nash : We absolutely need to change up the advertising a little bit, and we have done that. We started the new advertising campaign recently in Atlanta. And what we're focused on is making sure that the consumer understands that all the greatness that they know about CarMax up to this point is still there that we have an even better offering. So the real idea of putting the customer in the driver's seat, whichever way is their way is the way that the car buying will be. And that's what the focus has been on Atlanta, drawing the strengths of our stores, drawing the strengths of the digital technology that we've been investing in and drawing the strengths to our knowledgeable and skilled associates. So yes, the answer of your question is we have changed it up and I would expect that to continue to evolve over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth, your line is open. Seth Basham : My question is around CAF. If you can provide some color Tom, on what's happening with Tier 3 and the declining penetration there that will be helpful. Tom Reedy : Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, Seth, one thing we've got to keep in mind is with Tier 3 performance it's a combination of both what they're doing with the applications they see and the nature of the applications that they see as well, because they're -- after CarMax takes a look at it and Tier 3 takes a look at it, they're seeing whatever manages to move down to their space. And so as I mentioned on the call, we've seen some very strong performance as it relates to conversion of the applications viewed in the Tier 2 space, which is a good thing for us, because, as you know, we make significantly more money on the Tier 2 sales than we do in the Tier 3. And they're more likely to converting into sales because in general, the terms are a little bit better. So that's very positive for us though. What that sometimes it relates to is we're promoting customers from the Tier 3 space into the Tier 2 space meaning the Tier 3 sees a little bit less that there may be a little bit less robust mixed than they normally do. So they have, I would say, different pool to work with depending on what's going on with Tier 2. And this quarter, as I mentioned in the call, overall conversion was consistent with what we did last year, which means of the applications they saw they converted alike amount to last year just means that the nature and quantity that they saw didn't quite get there. So overall, between Tier 2 and Tier 3, we're very happy with our lending partners and the performance and they're doing good bias. Seth Basham : That's helpful. And as a follow-up, looking at your loan loss performance, that was pretty good this quarter better than we expected. Or during on some of your securitizations 2018-2, I'm just sorry, 2018-3, returning to the elevated delinquency trends, are you concerned at all about the trends that we\u2019re seeing there? Tom Reedy : No. I think if you look at the most recent venues, it\u2019s too early to make any judgment. But, overall in the portfolio, you\u2019re right, the delinquencies are little harder than last year, but we seen losses consistent to a little bit better. So as we\u2019ve talked couple -- we\u2019re trying to originate a portfolio that has accumulative net loss somewhere in the 2% to 2.5% range. We\u2019re very comfortable that we\u2019re trending within that range, and that\u2019s the goal and make sure it's financeable in the securitization mark. Feel good about all of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Michael, your line is open. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask on the other overhead costs bucket, there was 15% increase there. So I wanted to understand a little bit better, was that driven by the multi-channel initiative in Atlanta? And if that is the case, how should we think about that evolving over the course of the year as you guys expand more rapidly into other markets? Bill Nash : Yes, Michael. That increase is directly tied to our initiatives whether it\u2019s the omni-channel it\u2019s also some work we\u2019re doing on the platforms. It\u2019s really the thing that we\u2019ve been talking about for a period of time. And as far as going forward, like I said, we were going to continue to invest and the SG&A leverage point that we talked about in the past is still where we think we need to be in order to leverage that. Michael Montani : Can you share anything maybe to that end about the early learnings that you\u2019ve had in Charlotte and potential comp list that you would have seen from some of the initiatives there? How should we think about that as we look to Atlanta for validation of the strategy? Bill Nash : What I would tell you is Charlotte is not a good example to draw comparisons because the Charlotte offering is very different than what we have in the Atlanta offering. So, for example, one big thing is, it was a totally different website experience. Atlanta, we have a whole new website experience, which allows the customer progress. We didn\u2019t have that in Charlotte. Charlotte has really been the test market for us where we\u2019ve done a lot more things manual behind the scene. So, and in the early days, we really were just kind of pushing some folks over there so we could operationally figure it out. So I think we really don\u2019t have a good comparison to go off of at this point. And look, it\u2019s obviously very early in the rollout to Atlanta. But as I said in my remarks, our customers and our associates like it. Conversion on ones that we have done on delivery is higher than what you see in conversion in the stores, which is to be expected, finance penetration is roughly the same as you see in the store. So we\u2019ve seen some things early, but again, it\u2019s very, very early. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. James, your line is open. James Albertine : At the risk -- and I understand to your prior comments, it\u2019s very early, but when we think about the white paper some time ago and the -- so trajectory of CarMax as a growing brick-and-mortar strategy, clearly, you\u2019re learning now very rapidly about the benefits of omni-channel. If we think, maybe a little bit longer term, maybe kind of 3 to 5 year outlook, are we at a point now what we can say that CarMax can grow perhaps even faster with digital or omni-channel presence as opposed to primary focus on brick-and-mortar? And in so doing, is there a line of sight to an SG&A per unit level as steady-state that can be lower and a CapEx rate at steady state that can be lower relative to your brick-and-mortar strategy as you continue to gain share via omni-channel? Bill Nash : Yes, James, what I'll tell you is, first of all, omni-channel can only be enabled with our brick-and-mortar strategy. You have to have a great network of stores. If you don't, you really can't bring omni-channel a like-for-like, which is putting the customer in the driver seat. I think it's a little early on the SG&A side, like I said in the opening remarks. I think here in the near-term, we're going to be a little inefficient on the omni-channel, because we want to get it right. We want it to be a great customer experience, we want it to be a great associate experience, but we've also identified cost levers that we can pull that will offset those costs. So what I'm telling you is we need to learn some more to be able to definitively say, hey, is this going to be a cheaper cost structure or not? But we're encouraged by the progress that we've made, and we're encouraged by the progress we think we can still make. James Albertine : If I can follow-up on that point, and I know you've never put a line in the sand and we've always kind of talked about, everyone has got their own sort of estimates. Is it 300 stores at maturity? Is it something greater or is it something lower? Maybe, can I push you to make a comment to the extent that may be the algorithm, as you're learning about omni-channel? So as your omni-channel accelerating -- you're favoring the under versus the over, right? So ultimately at maturity, you're going to need fewer stores over time. Is that a fair comment at this point? Bill Nash : Well, I think the longest time we said we're going to open 200 to 300 stores, if you remember. Well, you can take 200 off, since we just opened that this week. As far as the upper end, I'm cautious on saying what the end state is. Look, I think we can add -- we have plenty of potential to add additional stores. I would just caution to say -- let's better understand the omni-channel. It would be great to be able to deliver more units out of existing footprint. So if our digital initiatives allow us to leverage our stores in ways more efficiently than we have in the past that could ultimately cut down or maybe some smaller footprint stores, I think that's a win. So I guess my short answer is we have room to continue to grow stores. But we also want to make sure we're growing market share in the most effective way possible. We've said we're -- we've already announced we'd open between 13 and 16 stores while, obviously come back in the fourth quarter update that will be in that range. But let's give omni a little bit more chance to see what we can do in existing market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John, your line is open. Aileen Smith : Good morning. This is Aileen Smith on for John. Another question on the omni-channel initiative. I realized it maybe early days on this. But can you give a little bit of color on the economics you expect for the omni-channel model? Should we be thinking about this business once it reaches the sustainable level on scale as gross profit per unit for vehicles sold through omni-channel is being similar to vehicles sold through the physical footprint? And how do you --SG&A and other expenses compare across those according to your estimates? Bill Nash : Yes, I think, obviously it's a little early. I think on the omni-channel, we have opportunities to optimize our staff. I think we have opportunity in transportation, I think we have opportunity in the compensation, our store roles. So while there are some incremental expenses right now on the actual delivery of vehicles, like I said earlier, we had the opportunity to pull on some leverage to offset them. And I don't see any reason at this point where GPU has to change. It has to change. But again, we're -- it's early on in the process. And keep in mind, we've only had this for a partial month of the quarter. Aileen Smith : Yes, absolutely. And just a quick follow-up to that. On optimizing the staff and transportation some of the other things you mentioned and the target that you'll get a majority of your markets, this rolled out by February 2020. Should we be thinking about that as the timeline where some of those efficiencies are realized or is this a longer dated dynamic? Bill Nash : We're actively working on it right now. It'll be right in tandem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with the Northcoast Research. John, your line is open. John Healy : Bill, I just wanted to ask just your view on markets outside of Atlanta for the omni-channel offering. I know you guys have said February 2020 that you would have the rollout completed. So over the next 15 months, how fast should we expect additional markets to come online? And as you enter into new markets like Buffalo for instance, will you be watching omni-channel simultaneously with the brick-and-mortar store? So just trying to understand kind of the pace from here. Bill Nash : Yes. So I just wanted to -- I want to clarify something. So we will have the majority of our customers being able to experience it by February 2020. As I said in the opening remarks, one of the things that we need to continue to do is expand our footprint on customer experience centers. We're actively looking at that right now for the next locations. And part of that is going to be dependent on state regulations. So for example, there are some states if you're involved in the selling activity, which your customer experience consultants are, they would require those folks to be licensed in the state, further complicated, if some of those states have requirements that those people physically come and get their license in those states. So that's an example of things that we're working through right now to figure out, okay, how many CTCs do we need, where the next CTC is going to be? As far as your question that we're going to roll it out with the new stores, we did not roll it out with Buffalo, we did not roll it out with Melbourne. We're going to roll it out in a very systematic way that makes sense for us. And we'll have more information on that next quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick, your line is open. Rick Nelson : Curious if you do anything different from a pricing standpoint when you launch in the Atlanta market and to try to drive share and mind share? Bill Nash : Yes. Rick, we're constantly doing pricing tests all the time. And I would say the Atlanta just falls in that bucket with everything else that we're doing when we look at doing pricing test. Rick Nelson : And you chose Atlanta because you mentioned it's an older market, high market share. Are those the types of markets that we should expect just to rollout to going forward? Bill Nash : As far as the order, again, it's a little early to tell. The other thing that's interesting about Atlanta is that we have six stores that are pretty much in the suburbs of Atlanta. So we kind of surround the perimeter. And we certainly looked at as a good opportunity to say, okay, can we get better penetration inside the perimeter of Atlanta? And I think this is a good -- a good test to be able to do that? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open. Seth Sigman : I wanted to talk a little bit about the shift in the business that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters with zero to four being lower again in Q3, and obviously a little bit worse in Q2. I know, you noted, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing some of the impact from that new versus used pricing gap although that\u2019s been the case for a few quarters now. So I\u2019m just curious, are there any other factors that could be driving that maybe the hurricane from last year? Does that have a disproportionate impact on zero to four? So you can address that. And then just the second part of the question is around pricing. And what do you think is still driving that gap, and if there\u2019s any signs of sort of normalization of that depreciation cycle? Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes, Seth. So if you look at our average selling price, it went up again. And that\u2019s because our acquisition price is up. Now, I did know in my opening remarks that we had a bigger percent of customers moving into the older vehicles, which would inherently take your average selling price down. But it wasn\u2019t enough to lower the sales price plus we had additional increases in higher class cars, which is why the pricing went up. There\u2019s a lot going on in the market right now. There\u2019s a lot of noise. I think some of the dynamics we're saying still some carryover from. And again, this is just my belief, is carried over from some of the conversation around tariffs, what\u2019s going to happen to pricing, and there\u2019s just a lot of things going on in the news. And I think consumers are thinking about monthly payments and thinking about if I\u2019m going to buy a car, how much do I want to get into? So again, it\u2019s dynamics that we\u2019ve seen in the past and we\u2019ll continue to work through them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas, your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius : I was curious when we start to see the omni-channel starts to flow through the financials that probably shows up in same-store sales growth as you drive better penetration in your existing markets. For the model to meet your return hurdle rates, what sort of impact should we thinking about for same-store sales? And then also, what\u2019s the cost to launch a new market for omni-channel versus a new market in a brick-and-mortar fashion? And what do you have to open up for an omni-channel market to be launched? Is it -- you mentioned the customer experience center, but is it thing sort of proximate transportation in that sort of thing? That would be helpful. Bill Nash : Yes. So first of all, the omni-channel experience. This is all about the customer and putting them in the driver seat. We\u2019re doing this because this is where the customer is going, and this is where we want to make sure we get ahead of. So I don\u2019t really think about as the incremental cost is doing it. I think about it as, hey, we want to be the best when it comes to serving our customers. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the second part of your question? Armintas Sinkevicius : The second part was what we\u2019re trying to -- you sort of expecting to or what sort of impact do we see those as same-store sales to meet the hurdle rate on return side for the omni-channel experience? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the way you should think about success in the short-term for Omni, first is it's getting this experience everywhere and evolving it to make sure that the best experience for both our customers and associates. That is the near-term goal. And then, in tandem, we want to execute it the most effectively, efficiently that we can. So we\u2019re going to be working on that. Now, all of this obviously is to increase market share over time. But I really don't want to get any more specific at this point given that we just haven't had much experience with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Colin, your line is open. Colin Ducharme : Questions have been answered. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David, your line is open. David Whiston : I know I'm probably little early in asking this. But I'm just curious with some of the chatter going around in the financial prospect perhaps due to the withholding law change the tax refunds maybe a bit disappointing. Are you considering -- how are you factoring that in the planning? What kind of inventory levels you want in March and April? Bill Nash : Yes. I think that's the big question is where are the tax refunds? We're obviously going to follow that very closely. I think we have shown over time that we manage our inventory very, very well and can meet the customer needs. And I would say, I think we're in a great position. But we're also looking at the same things that you are to better understand how my tax refunds impact the upcoming quarter and the quarter beyond. David Whiston : And as a follow-up on the current sourcing environment, are you having any issues with perhaps quality late model vehicles not ever making it to auction because they're selling -- staying at the dealer level as they come off lease? Bill Nash : No. We are not having any issues with obtaining inventory -- quality inventory. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris, your line is open Chris Bottiglieri : Consider a very ambitious rollout target to cover all the markets next few years given Atlanta appears to be your first real attempt at this. So I was hoping if you can maybe walk us through the mechanics in the market conversion. Just help us understand where you see down at the market level to even allow last mile delivery or online retailing? And then what are the bottlenecks of the corporate size to all these capabilities? Bill Nash : Yes. So one of the things we've talked about already is the CEC, the customer experiences centers. We have to stand those up. That really takes we call e-Office shifts out of the stores. So right now, the sales consultant that works in our stores works both the e-Office and they work on the floor. They have shifts for both our customer experience centers take to e-Office shift out. As far as the delivery fees, we obviously have vans that are taking the vehicles out. The way we rollout Atlanta is probably going to be a little bit different from that perspective as far as how we staff those and leverage associates in the existing stores. We're the first rollout to get it out there. Now, we're really fine tuning what the future rollouts will be. And truthfully, I think we'll get better and better and more efficient as we as we do more. Chris Bottiglieri : And then, I guess, separately, it's very early you expect to see more dynamic. I guess, what gave you the confidence in the first place such as -- such an aggressive target for the rollout rather than maybe proven that it works before setting that? I guess how much flexibility is there on that timeline? Thank you. Bill Nash : Well, keep in mind, we've been testing and talking to consumers for the last couple years. This is something that just didn't happen overnight. And it's one of the reasons we've taken the time that we have to really understand what the customer wants. And that's what this is about. It's all about where the customer is going, what they're looking for. So I do feel that it's an aggressive rollout given the new capability that you're going to introduce, but I also feel that it's very doable. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Brian Nagel : So as my follow-up, I wanted maybe show up two questions -- two quick questions together. But first up, with regard to expenses, as we've talked a lot about it in the call, the ongoing reinvestment in the company, if I'm not -- if I'm correct here in the fiscal third quarter look like expense growth slowed. So I just and I can't recall if you discussed it in the prepared comments. So any color around that that's right in third quarter whether that means this trend going forward? And then my second question is just on the buyback and not that long ago you announced pretty substantial additional buyback. Your stock with the market has been hit here. How are you thinking about philosophically towards fulfilling that buyback? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. So Brian, on the expenses slowing the third quarter. So keep in mind, when the sales down you are going to have a little bit of hiccup from variable, because you won't have as much variable. But in addition to that, we feel good because we've gotten -- we've rolled out -- we've been focused on SG&A as well as cost to good sold, we've done some staffing optimization, so there's some good guys in that as well. So not only we continue to invest all along I've said, there's going to be incremental expenses we're going to invest, but it shouldn't all the incremental. We should challenge ourselves to find offset. So I feel good about that. As far as buybacks, look, we think it's a great way to give back to the shareholders. We, just as Tom talked about earlier, have authorization to do some more. And we'll continue to do that. Tom Reedy : Yes, Brian, we've talked about this before. We structured the program to get a little bit more aggressive when the valuation is down, and a little bit more conservative looks like the valuation is high relative to what our research. And as you can see during the quarter, we brought back more than we did in Q2 for that very purpose. So we're aware of -- very aware of what our stock price is doing. And we -- as we plan to buyback programmatically, that's kind of the way the guardrails work. We also have the ability to do additional as we see it be the right thing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Colin, your line is open. Bill Nash : Hello? Colin Ducharme : That was on mute. Just kidding. I did think of one. Bill, I had a quick question for you. What metrics are you going to be using over the ensuing months to help you throttle the cadence of the omni-channel rollout? Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure, Colin. So I think we're going to be looking at variety of metrics. We're looking at how well it's received by our customers. I think we're going to be looking at how well we do on conversion? How it impacts the store performance? The expenses, how efficiently we can do it? What are the levers? There isn't any one single, because this is such a new thing. We have a whole host of different things that we're going to be looking at over the ensuing months to make sure that, one, we're giving the best experience; two, we're doing it the most efficiently; and three, that we're ultimately driving market share. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I really want to thank our 25,000 associates. They are the differentiator for CarMax in the way they live our values and how they do that with each other, our customers and all the communities that we're in. I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday season and has time to enjoy with the family and friends, and a great New Year. And we will talk to you next year. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Katharine Kenny : Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm here with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive VP and CFO. Let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Thank you in advance for asking one question, as usual, and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll start with the fourth quarter highlights. After that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and he will discuss SG&A, investments in consumer finance, and then I'll share an overall update on our omni-channel rollout, which has been very well received, and then, as always, I'll open it for your questions. Starting with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to reiterate what I said in the earnings release. We are pleased with our double-digit pretax earnings growth, even after adjusting for the discretionary bonus we paid last year to eligible associates. We achieved this in the midst of continued investments in our business and our associates. This is a testament to the strength of our diversified business model and ongoing focus on operational efficiencies. Used unit comps grew by 2.8%, compared to a negative 8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. They were driven by strong conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic. While we were pleased to report positive comps this quarter, we believe they were affected by delays in the February tax refunds relative to last year, continued higher acquisition prices, and a robust competitive environment. Total used units grew by 5.6%. As you know, we track market share data on a calendar year basis, and report it once a year in the fourth quarter. Our data indicates that our share of zero to 10-year-old vehicles in our current comp markets fell from approximately 4.5% in 2017, to 4.4% in 2018. While this is disappointing, the decrease in share occurred earlier in the year and started to reverse in the second-half of the year when we saw share gains.  This year's decrease was in comparison to an almost 7% growth in comp market share in calendar year 2017, which was our largest increase in four years. Our website traffic grew in the fourth quarter by 13%. Our retail gross profit per used unit remains stable at $2166 compared to $2,147 last year. As we've shared in the past, there are two primary factors that impact our decisions around gross profit per unit. The first is ensuring that our prices are competitive in the marketplace. Second, we focus on optimizing total gross profit dollars by balancing margin per vehicle and unit sales. We are confident in our price competitiveness, but as always, we will continue to monitor and test pricing elasticity. Wholesale units grew by 3.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter, and gross profit per wholesale unit grew to $977 this quarter, compared to $946 in the prior year period. Other gross profit was a strong contributor to the quarter, increasing by almost 42% or $32 million. As we mentioned earlier this year, we secured provider cost decreases related to EPP revenues. We used a portion of these funds to improve the margins, and the remainder to selectively reduce prices which drove increased penetration. Service margin benefited from comp sales growth as we were able to leverage service overhead, and third-party finance fees benefited from the shift in our sales mix by finance channel. This explains the majority of the increase. The remainder relates to a positive adjustment to our EPP cancellation reserve as a result of our annual model update, and a discretionary bonus of approximately $4 million that we paid to our service department associates in last year's fourth quarter. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me discuss our sales mix and store openings. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four year old vehicles decreased to about 72% versus 76% in the fourth quarter of last year, and 77% in the third quarter. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 46% of our sales up from 43% this time last year. During the fourth quarter, we opened five stores, which included three stores in new television markets, Buffalo, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. We also opened stores in our existing television markets of Orlando and Portland, Oregon. During the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we plan to open three stores one of which we opened earlier this week and represents our second store in the Memphis market. We will also open two stores in Texas, which are new markets, Waco and McAllen. Tom? Tom Reedy : Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $429 million. Factors increasing SG&A expense in the fourth quarter included the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, which represents a 10% growth on our store base. Our continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives, and an increase of 33.9 million or $19 per unit related to share-based compensation expense. SG&A per unit was 2,380, a $17 decrease year-over-year. We are pleased to show SG&A leverage as it demonstrates that we are able to offset some of the growth in spend with efficiencies and staffing optimization. I'll remind you that within the comp and benefits line, prior year amount included roughly $4 million of the discretionary annual bonus that was paid to eligible associates last year. Also the timing of our advertising spend last year was weighted towards the end of year, which accounts for the relative lack of growth in advertising dollars this fourth quarter. We continue to invest in three primary areas, our associates, our legacy systems, and our digital initiatives. For associates, this includes a variety of wage adjustments and healthcare plan enhancements. Our associates are vital to our success, and maintaining a very competitive compensation and benefits program is key to attracting and retaining the best talent. In order to execute our omni-channel vision we must continue to upgrade our legacy operating systems. While this spending won't offer short-term return it is critical to our future competitive position. We will also continue to invest in digital initiatives. We are developing and implementing tools that help our associates be more efficient and effective. In addition, we continue to introduce online enhancements to improve the customer experience. Now moving over to CapEx, we expect to spend 350 million for fiscal 2020 that's roughly $50 million above FY 2019 and the spend includes a shift in some spending originally planned for fiscal 2019. The 13 FY 2020 stores plus planned acquisition for future openings and three customer experience centers. Looking out to fiscal 2021, we are in a position to open a similar number of stores as we are targeted in the last few years. However, our business model is clearly evolving and we will continue to evaluate both the number and type of locations we need going forward. Finally, we plan to support shareholder returns by continuing to invest in our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $270 million. For the full year, we returned 903 million buying back 13.6 million shares compared to about 9 million in FY 2018. While maybe stating the obvious the return on this investment shows up in the difference between net income growth and EPS growth roughly 6.5 percentage points for the fiscal year. We have over $2 billion remaining in our current stock repurchase authorization. Now moving to capital and financing results. Our third-party lending partners continued their strong performance. Tier 2 executed especially well year-over-year accounting for 19.5% of used unit sales compared with 15.4% last year, while Tier 3 represented 10.7% of sales compared to 11.7% last year. Their performance is measured by sales applications continues to be very solid. CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 42.1%, down marginally from last year's fourth quarter. CAF net loans originated in the quarter grew by 4.5% to $1.5 billion. The modest decline in penetration slightly offset our sales growth and the small increase in average amount financed. Capping up, income increased $2.6 million to $104 million. This was result of the growth in average managed receivables partially offset by the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.5% of average managed receivables compared to 5.6% in both the fourth quarter of last year and this year's third quarter. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.7% versus 7.9% a year-ago and 8.5% in this year's third quarter.  A provision for loan losses at $42 million grew in line with the portfolio and the allowance for loan losses was 1.10% of any managed receivables consistent with both last year's fourth quarter and with the third quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Tom. As you all know we've been laying the groundwork and building towards the development of a new experience for the past couple of years. To launch it successfully, we took a number of steps including forming our product organization, upgrading our technology and then leveraging these to construct new digital capabilities and online consumer experience offering. These investments are essential to our vision for the future. Spending for FY 2020 like in FY 2019 will represent a step up in investment. So we believe we will acquire comps in the range of 5% to 8% to leverage SG&A similar to our thinking for FY 2019. We expect the amount of growth in the spending to slow in FY 2021 and taper after that. We will continue to look for opportunities to reduce ways and reprioritize spend which contributed to our ability to leverage this fourth quarter. Now let me talk a little bit more about Atlanta and our omni-channel rollout. Please remember that Atlanta is one market and we've only had a few months of experience to evaluate. With that said, we are very pleased with our performance. In conjunction with the launch of omni-channel, we introduced a number of other elements including increased free transfers, a new Web site, a new advertising campaign and pricing test. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in both comp sales and appraisal. This increase was beyond what we would have expected to gain. We are also pleased with the high conversion on home delivery sales although it represents a very small percentage of overall sales at this point. In comparison to our stores in the Atlanta market, our home delivery finance penetration is similar while MaxCare penetration is little lower. Keep in mind, I normally don't give market specific details nor do I plan to change this practice going forward. But given the interest in this new initiative I wanted to give a little more context. We also know that we will be less efficient in some of our operations in the near term as we roll out the omni-channel experience. Some of these inefficiencies are by design and some are simply those related to starting up a new capability. As a result, our sales in the Atlanta market are a little less profitable per unit compared with other markets at this point. We do believe that we will be able to improve on this as we continue to roll out omni-channel and as our consumer experience mature. We also believe this unique experience could be more efficient than our current model. We have a strong track record of operational excellence and we are confident in our ability to optimize. Most importantly, after seeing the results so far in Atlanta, we are even more confident that this is the right direction. We believe that the omni-channel experience will be one of the key levers that helps drive comp sales and market share growth going forward. Now, let me let me talk about the next steps. This fiscal year we expect to open three CECs or Customer Experience Centers across the U.S., each will have an average staff of 300 associates and will serve multiple states. Our experience in Atlanta suggests that we will be able to offset these additional associates with a reduction in sales consultants in omni-channel stores which will be realized through normal attrition. So first CECs will be in Atlanta and we'll open early in the second quarter as it supports the next phase of our omni rollout, which will include Florida stores. We also expect to open the second CEC site in Kansas City later in the second quarter, and we are currently working on the third site. As we previously said, we plan to bring the omni-channel experience to the majority of our customers by February, 2020. As I've often talked to you about before, we are leveraging the strengths of the CarMax model that we've built over the last 25 years to deliver this new experience. Strengths that include our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint and transportation infrastructure, our inventory scale and merchandising capabilities, our continued investment in technology and digital capability, and our industry-leading brand. These strengths are not only critical, but essential to delivering an omni experience, an experience that's tailored to every single customer. An experience that is unmatched and we believe will be the future of car buying. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Kim? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Sharon. Sharon Zackfia : Thanks for the color on Atlanta. I guess just a multifaceted question to keep in line with Katharine's rules around Atlanta. Could you give us some color on what the comp trend was before omni-channel? So, it's helpful to hear about the double digits, but I don't know if Atlanta was like similar to the overall company prior to that, just so we can understand the amount of improvement you saw when omni-channel rolled out. And then secondly, could you give a little bit more color around that discussion about Atlanta being a little bit less profitable on a per car basis. Are you talking just gross profit per car or all-in on a per car basis? And ultimately, do you think omni-channel is similar to your current model in terms of profitability? Bill Nash : Sharon, you're really pushing Katharine's\u2026 Sharon Zackfia : Well, she's retiring soon, so. Bill Nash : Let me talk about the comps. First of all, I'm not going to go into any real detail on the comps, but I'll give you a little color, in that we have a control group obviously that we look at. And we're very pleased with the lift that we saw beyond the control group. As far as the profitability, when I talked a little less profitable, that is all-in, so that's looking at SG&A, that's looking at margin. Truthfully, on the SG&A pressures, as I addressed in my opening script, we feel like we can at least offset those, and we feel like this model could be more efficient. And as far as any type of margin pressures, those are two different, whether you roll omni out and have decided to do something different margin, those aren't dependant one on -- or the other. Sharon Zackfia : Yes, thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel : Nice quarter as always. I want to follow-up on Sharon's questions, I'll try to put mine all under one as well. But with regard to Atlanta and that double-digit comp, can you talk about what, of all the facets, if you will, of the omni-channel effort in Atlanta, were you able to isolate what are the most important facets that's helping to drive that comp? And to what extent is that improvement in sales reflective of you speaking to or connecting with potentially a new customer for CarMax? Bill Nash : Yes, so Brian, the different facets, when we implement, for example, advertising or we do something different on free transfers, we know kind of what we would expect to see. We have some expectations of what we would see. And when you look at each one of those individually, add it up, we saw a lift beyond what we would normally expect to see. So, I think that's something when you look at the sum of the parts it's more than any individual component. And what was the second part? Brian Nagel : I'm sorry. With regard to is it a new customer, is it just helping to drive that comp, is it a customer that maybe CarMax in the past would not have connected with? Bill Nash : Yes, at this point it's hard to tell. And the only thing I would say it we've seen some instances on home delivery that we probably are picking up some customers that maybe we wouldn't have because they physically couldn't have gotten into the store. But this experience is much more than just home delivery and I think it's a better experience for the customers. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Bill, you had mentioned that you had a modest share decline on the year. That's a bit of a surprise given you opened 10% more stores. What do you think caused you to struggle early in the year, and then what changed to reverse it? Bill Nash : Well, hey, Craig. Just to clarify. I talk about comp growth, nationwide market share actually went up a little bit, but the comp markets went down a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, we saw those declines earlier in the year, and then we started to -- saw a reversal towards the latter half. And I think we've been in an unusual pricing environment the whole quarter, really starting off in the first quarter of this year. And different organizations manage through that differently. Some may give up margin for sales, for example, and our pricing elasticity tests wouldn't support that. The other thing is I just think that it's been a competitive environment overall. Look, this is a good business to be in. And I think the new cars are under a little bit of pressure. And so I think we have some new entrants, I think we have -- there's some more advertising. There's just more general noise overall in the marketplace. So, I think those are both contributing factors, especially early on as we saw different competitors pull different levers. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson from Stephens. Your line is open. Rick Nelson : Thanks. So, Bill, can you talk about three CECs that you're going to roll out 300 associates per CEC. Are you going to be able to pull out a like number of associates out of the stores or how do you see that affecting expense? Bill Nash : Sure. We absolutely expect to pull out a like number, at least a like number. Again, what we've seen so far in Atlanta, if you think about the way we staff a store currently, we staff it for what we call e-office shifts, shifts where people take phone calls and follow-up on e-leads. We no longer have to staff that. So, we will get to the appropriate staffing levels in each store through normal attrition. So we would expect to offset the store staffing with what we have in the CECs. And I think over time this will be a more efficient model, because if you think about it, we have more than 7,000 sales associates across the country. And we're currently asking them all to be part-time e-office sales associates. And some like it, some of them don't, some are good and some aren't so good. So, I think by leveraging folks that are very skilled at this, this is all they focus on, over time will give us even more leverage. Rick Nelson : Great, thanks. And good luck. Bill Nash : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Beth Reed : Good morning. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. I wanted to ask about online marketplaces, like CarGurus. I know you guys have kind of indicated that changing up your merchandizing on these sites and better advertising your quality message could help improve the price perception, because in many cases it doesn't seem like you're getting the credit you should be getting for your reconditioning processes. So just wondering, one, how big of an impact do you think this is having on your sales? And then, two, any color you can give around specific initiatives, if any, and timeframe to improve your \"Value ranking\" on these listing sites would be helpful. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure, Beth. First of all, we feel good about our prices. That being said, we're always making sure that we've got a good price perception. We want to make sure that the customers understand the value of our cars. So there's really four focus areas that we're working on, one of which you alluded to. But first, we're focused more on the quality message and transparency on our Web site, and we're already doing this. As a matter of fact, we rolled out a new Web site nationwide at the latter part of the quarter. We're also focusing more on quality and transparency in our non-Web site advertising, so TV, banners, retargeting things like that. The third thing, which is what you alluded to, is we're working with third-party listing sites to get the credit for our quality standards and the reconditioning that we do. Most third-party Web sites, they don't factor any type of quality or condition into their algorithms. Or if they do, it's not on a consistent basis. So, I feel really good about all those things, we're making great progress. And it may be a factor, but I just don't think it's -- to your other question, I just don't think it's had a major impact on overall comps. Beth Reed : Okay, thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Seth. Seth Basham : Bill, can you just give us an update on what your internal research has shown in terms of the price perception out there of your cars relative to the industry? And then secondly, on your price test in Atlanta, and otherwise, what you're learning from those? Bill Nash : Okay, the first part of your question on just the research, what our research would tell you for example on like a car groves, our most recent research would tell you that the majority of our cars are either fair, good, or great and that's without any -- at this point without any credit for the quality. I am sorry, what was the second for your question? Seth Basham : The pricing tests? Bill Nash : Oh yes, the pricing tests that I noted, that's part of our normal pricing tests that we do all time. Look, we can drive more sales absolutely just by lowering our prices, but again is that balance of optimizing our total gross profit, total gross profit dollars while also making sure that were competitive in the marketplace and competitive in the marketplace doesn't mean on short-term periods like quarter to quarter. We're looking for structural changes where we may not be competitive we just haven't seen that so we feel really good about where we are in price and what we're seeing on our pricing test as far as normal elasticity. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious about how much you had spent on marketing in Atlanta and how you plan \u2013 how much you plan to spend going forward. And then just separately any comments on the phasing of the launches for the omni-channel initiative through the course of this year? Bill Nash : Okay so marketing in Atlanta, Atlanta is what we call high awareness market. If you think about we spent is in conjunction with this it would have been normal to like a geo proven to be going into Atlanta. Which is a step up obviously then what we are paying going forward as far as what will spend in additional market every market is going to be a little bit different because it depends on the awareness of what we were previously spending there. As far as the phases of rollout like I said, we will get the second CEC opened early in the second quarter and in conjunction with that we will start rolling out two additional stores with Florida stores being first. Beyond that we'll update you next quarter the cadence of the other stores the stores we already did by the end of the quarter as well as the future stores. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay, and just so I am clear that the marketing you've been spending at Atlanta, does that amount to essentially what you're planning to spend on a run rate basis or will that step up as you sort of work through maybe the various kinks with all of the Web site and the market et cetera? Bill Nash : No I think you should think about a more holistically as part how much we spend in advertising on a per-unit basis. And if you look at year-over-year I would expect FY 2020 -- there maybe a little bit of an increase in the per unit advertising expense overall because we do want to support our omni-channel rollout. So I would expect a little on a per unit basis going forward. Armintas Sinkevicius : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Bill Nash : Good morning. John Murphy : Just wanted to touch on one stat just to make sure had these number straight Bill. I think you mentioned the zero to four portion of your sales was down at 72% versus 76% last year and 77% in the third quarter. I just want to make sure I have that right and if we think below that sort of what the percentages are, and really as you look at the market I mean as vehicle quality has improved so dramatically in the last decade. Could you consider going down a little bit further in the age spectrum because the quality of the vehicle is going to be still really what you want to deliver to the customer nearly new used vehicle. And just really sort of tip of the iceberg might be much, much larger for you over time as you down age spectrum? Bill Nash : John, you do have those percentages right, the 72 versus the 76. And look the beauty of this business model as we can sell what the customers are looking for. And this quarter we saw consumers that were interested in a little bit older vehicle. I think part of that is because of the pricing. Keep in mind we're lapping if you look at year-over-year this fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter. We have the largest step up in mixed adjusted acquisition price its more than $500. If you look at the quarter this year, we still had a little bit of an incremental bump up on that one that we had last year. So prices are still expenses so I think what you're seeing is probably people just from affordability standpoint moving down. But you're obviously right we'll be able to secure vehicles and sell them if that's what consumers are looking for. John Murphy : Bill, just to want follow-up, I mean is the beauty of that, that you know that you might be able to have lower acquisition prices in the future with this high-quality product and still have the same dollar grosses and have a much more capital efficient business model? Bill Nash : Well, if we would -- if we continue to have older vehicles, our overall average selling price, you're absolutely right, would go down. John Murphy : And grocers which stay about the same, right, just based on your focus, and what\u2026 Bill Nash : Absolutely. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. David Whiston : Just question with new vehicle sales coming down, is that all positive for you right now is it greatly helping you do two more awfully supply and more budget conscious consumers you were just talking about? Or do you think also consumer confidence is down marginally versus a year ago? Bill Nash : No, I think. I mean, if I look at the new car, I think it's been a pretty, pretty flat year for overall new car sales. I think we've proven that in years where it goes up a little bit, years where it goes down a little bit, we've been able to have success on both sides of that. And as far as I can tell, consumer confidence is still very, is still very strong. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Given the comparisons on a tier basis to the Atlanta's comp performance outperform the rest of the surveys by a similar amount as it is on a one-year basis. Then I guess, thinking through that, is there any other reasons why investors shouldn't extrapolate Atlanta's comp trend to the rest of the store base given your intentions to roll it out to all stores this year? Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes, Chris. Atlanta is one market and every single market is going to perform differently and the reason I say that is because we have experienced a lot of different markets and you just look at the core business each market performs a little differently, so I don't think you can extrapolate what we see in this market versus what we're going to see in other markets which is why I say, \"Hey, remember this is this is only one market.\" And again, on the double-digit comp increase, we feel really good about that, we feel like it's a lift to bubble, we expected when we also compared to the control group. So we -- and it's not all due to omni, as I, said earlier is there's a lot of different elements playing into that. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then just quickly, if you're able to -- well, I'll hop back and want to recap just real, I'll hop back in. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Hey, guys. I wanted to follow up on the expense growth. So the 5% to 8% comps you need to leverage SG&A, I guess you said that similar to 2018, you also discussed being less efficient in the short-term, right? so how do I reconcile those two and if there are some levers that may be limit the negative impact from the investments, can you just sort of help us understand that? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, I think that you know the guys on the five-day was really to help clarify a little bit of what we are saying because we were saying high mid-single digit. We put a little range on there and I think we put the range on because it just somewhat depends on how much we get done and then also how much we can continue to offset through re-privatization and savings. Seth Sigman : Okay, I'll hop back in. Hold on. Well I mean may be on the same point if you could give us a sense of the timeline of the investments throughout the year to the extent you can particularly with the CC is rolling out in the second quarter just how do we think about the cadence of maybe expense growth throughout the year. Bill Nash : Yes, it's -- I'm not going to give any guidance on how I think it's you know. We just have to wait and see, it's going to be distributed throughout the year, as I said, well, there is going to be some additional expense. They're going to be some in the second quarter; you're picking up some there. So I think you got to think about it on the whole year because there could be a little timing from one quarter to the, to the next quarter. Seth Sigman : Okay, thanks. Bill Nash : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So it's quick question, you -- can you may just walk us through what it takes to convert an omni-channel market, I think you're in three markets today. My guess is you'll probably plan to get to 100 to 200 markets over the year in February. Maybe you can just walk us through kind of like what it takes to actually take your legacy store model and convert it to omni-channel like what are the -- what are the technology steps, the training steps or whatever else it takes to convert the market, it would be helpful? Thank you. Bill Nash : Okay. First of all, Chris, thanks for getting back in line for the second question. Listen, on the omni, there's two big things that have to be accomplished. I mean, we've been setting the groundwork. As I said in my opening remarks from a technology standpoint, that kind of thing, but in addition to that, we have to get our customer experience centers open, because obviously, that's a critical part of the whole omni-channel experience. So that's one of the things that we have to continue to work through, we feel good about the plan, we feel very strong about our ability to get to what we've learned out there, which is by February next year having this offer to the majority of our customers. The other thing is that there is this, we've got 25,000 associates, and as Tom talked about earlier, they are the key differentiators for us. So this is going to be obviously a big change for them. They're excited about it. And they have been super helpful as in helping us figure this out, as we've rolled it out, what we have today is better than what we had, and when we first rolled out in Atlanta, and that will continue to improve as we go forward. But we have to make sure that they understand, there's a lot of change management and what does it mean for them and how it's going to impact them and give the ability, give them the ability to adjust for that change. So those are the big things in addition to a lot of the groundwork that we've been laying and just everybody is clear. This is an iterative process. This omni-channel experience is an experience that can be every customer that's out there, it's not meant for one segment versus another segment, it's -- we should be able to serve every single customer and give them an unbelievable experience. And that requires a lot of things that we already have. So for example, the importance of our store, I can't overstate how important is that we have a physical presence, and that we continue to have a physical presence, and increase that physical presence because as we go forward, so we're leveraging a lot of things that we that we already have. Operator : Your next question comes from Ali Faghri from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Ali Faghri : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, just on the tax refunds, you called it out as a headwind in the fourth quarter based on your historical experience. You expect to get some of those loss volumes back in the first quarter as those refund levels normalize? Bill Nash : Yes. So the way I think about that is the same way I think about whether it's a timing and generally will, will work itself back out. And as I look at February, I think probably by our best estimate, there was about seven about a week that we didn't see a tax refund benefits, just because they were delayed and coming out really until the last part of the quarter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to Bill Nash. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. Listen, thank you all for joining the call today. I really appreciate your support and your interest in CarMax. I also got to thank our more than 25,000 associates. Tom has talked about this, I've talked about it, they are the true differentiator for CarMax. Our associates are the ones that are bringing this new customer experience to life. I want to thank you all for what you do every single day, and we will talk again at the end of next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, and last time, let me thank you in advance for asking one question and getting back in the queue for follow-up. Thank you. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I get started, I do want to take a moment to personally thank Katharine who many of you know is retiring at the end of July, so this is her last call. Katharine has run a very successful IR program for us over the past 13 years and I'm sure that you all agree that she will be deeply missed. Katharine, we wish you the best in your retirement. I hope it exceeds your expectations. I'd also like to introduce Stacy Frole, who similar to Katharine has a very strong IR background. And as many of you already know, Katherine and Stacy have been working closely together over the last months to ensure a smooth transition in Investor Relations' communications. So, welcome Stacy and again, congratulations, Katharine. Katharine Kenny : Thanks Bill. Bill Nash : For today's call, I'll start with our first quarter highlights. I will then turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financials in more detail before providing an update on our omni-channel rollout, which continues to perform very well. Then we will open it up for your questions. As you read in earnings release this morning, we are pleased to announce a very strong start to fiscal 2020 with net earnings growth up 11.8% and EPS up 19.5%. We achieved a 9.5% increase in used unit comps and a 13% increase in our total used units sold. This strength in retail is the result of a combination of many factors, including our solid execution, which was supported by enhancements to the customer experience; a robust lending environment; and a delay of February tax refunds into our first quarter. Conversion for the quarter increased year-over-year, while store traffic remained relatively unchanged. Our website traffic grew 15% from a year ago. Gross profit per unit for the quarter was consistent with prior year at $2,215. We continue to drive efficiencies in our inventory management systems, allowing us to maintain margins while offering attractive prices. In addition to strong retail sales in the first quarter, we reported higher wholesale units with volume up 6% for the quarter versus a year ago. This was the result of an all-time record buy rate as well as the growth in our store base year-over-year. Gross profit per wholesale unit was $1,043, an increase of 3.1% compared with last year. This strong wholesale performance likely benefited from the delay in tax refunds as well. As a percentage of sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased less than 1% to 76% versus 77% in the first quarter of last year. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 46% of our sales, up from 43% this time last year. At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks Bill and good morning everybody. For the quarter, we saw strong performance in other gross profit, which increased 11.6%. This was largely driven by an 11.2% increase in EPP net revenues, reflecting the combined effects of strong used volume growth along with increased penetration and margins, which were partially offset by an increase in the cancellation reserve. Also remember, in last year's first quarter, EPP revenues included $4 million related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. On the SG&A front, expenses for the quarter increased 11.7% to $490 million. Factors impacting our SG&A spend included the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the first quarter last year, which represents a 10% growth in our store base; higher variable costs associated with our strong sales growth; a $14 million or $46 per unit increase in share-based compensation expense; as well as continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives. SG&A per used unit was $2,183, a $26 decrease year-over-year. We're pleased to show leverage in the midst of substantial investment and the $46 per unit increase in share-based compensation. While the quarter did benefit from some timing differences, we were able to offset a portion of the growth spend with efficiencies and will continue to focus our efforts on this. Our provision for income taxes benefited from the impact of stock option settlements by $3.1 million. This translates to an 89 basis point reduction in our effective tax rate for the quarter. Now, I'll turn to CAF and customer finance. In the quarter, we saw higher application volume and strong performance across all credit tiers. Tier 2 accounted for 20.3% of sales compared with 17% last year, while Tier 3 accounted for 11.5% versus 10.9% a year ago. CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 41.4% compared with 42.9% in last year's first quarter. While we saw increased allocations across the board, it was definitely more pronounced in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space. Year-over-year, CAF net loans originated grew by 9.7% to $1.8 billion as the increase in used cars sold was somewhat offset by the decrease in CAF net penetration rates. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.9% compared with 8.4% a year ago and 8.7% in the fourth quarter. CAF income of $116 million was up just slightly compared to the first quarter last year. The impact of growth and average managed receivables was offset by a $7 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a slight compression in portfolio interest margin. This margin was 5.6% versus 5.7% a year ago and 5.5% in Q4. The provision for loan losses was $38 million in Q1 versus $31 million in the prior year period. The increase arises from portfolio growth along with some unfavorable loss experienced versus our expectations, which translates into a related increase in the overall allowance for losses. The allowance at $147 million represents 1.14% of ending managed receivables versus 1.13% in Q1 of last year and 1.10% in Q4. While the allowance has increased a modest four basis points sequentially, it remains well within our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix. As we discussed last quarter, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value through continued investment in our associates, our business and our capital structure. During the quarter, we opened three stores, two in new markets, Waco and McAllen, Texas; and our second store in Memphis, Tennessee. Earlier in June, we opened our Atlanta customer experience center. Over the next 12 months, we're anticipating opening 14 more stores and two customer experience centers. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $205 million. Since starting the stock buyback program in 2012, we have returned more than $4.6 billion to shareholders and we have $1.9 billion remaining in current authorizations. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Tom. As we look towards the future, we continue to believe the unique and powerful integration of our in-store and online capabilities provides us with a significant competitive advantage. And as consumers continue to do more online, it's important that we provide them with the ability to shop on their terms anywhere, anytime. While we are still in the early stages, we are very pleased with the results in our Atlanta market. The strong performance we saw last quarter carried over into the first quarter. Once again, we saw double-digit comps and the Atlanta market continues to outperform the overall company in both comp sales and appraisal buys. Our finance penetration is similar to the rest of the company, while max care penetration is slightly lower. Home delivery continues to experience high conversion, although it remains a small percentage of our overall sales in Atlanta. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe our unique omnichannel experience could be more efficient than our current model. We do anticipate some inefficiencies in some of our operations in the near-term, however, we know that we will be able to improve as omni markets mature and our customer experience centers become fully utilized. We continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities and experiences for both our associates and customers based on their feedback and reactions. We remain confident that we are moving in the right direction and our omnichannel experience will be one of the key drivers of comp sales and market share growth going forward. Here are some specific updates on the progress of our rollout. The Atlanta customer experience center, or CEC, just opened this month, and we will be opening one in Kansas City in late July. We are also in the process of working on a third location, which will open later this year. Over time, the three large CECs will each staff more than 300 associates. Having spent some time in our new Atlanta CEC, I'm convinced that this is the right solution for continuing to improve our customer experience. The technology is state-of-the-art and integrates well with our store systems. Our associates are excited and well-positioned to focus on progressing the customer online and providing an exceptional experience. With the opening of the Atlanta CEC, we rolled the omnichannel experience to the majority of our Florida stores earlier this month. Later this quarter, we will continue the rollout to new markets, including those in North Carolina and Virginia. We remain on track to provide our omnichannel experience to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal year 2020. As I've said on prior calls, to bring omni to life, we're leveraging the strength of the CarMax model that we've built over the past 25 years along with new technology and digital capabilities. This is an experience that we can tailor to each individual customer. This is the future of car buying. We're off to a great start, and we're excited about the future. And at this point, we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Hi. So, I guess I was hoping you might be able to shed a little bit more light just regarding the inflection that we happened to see this quarter. I mean we had a couple of quarters that might've been -- I guess, a lot of people would term them as relatively underwhelming 3Q, 4Q. And obviously, we're still early in the Atlanta rollout, so you can't just point to omnichannel as what caused the inflection here. So, if you can provide any more color on that, I think that'll be fantastic for the group. Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure Scot. So, in my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about tax rate funds lending environment, but let me give you a little bit more color. On the improved execution, we highlighted conversion. The store did a phenomenal job not only on the face-to-face conversion, but getting folks on the website into the store. So, we had great conversion success. Our buyers did a phenomenal job on vehicle acquisition this quarter. Shipping logistics, we had some efficiencies we picked up there. And anytime, as we've said in the past, when we pick up these efficiencies, we generally are passing them along in price reductions. We had some improvements in the customer experience or our digital initiatives. The main things there -- I don't know if you've noticed, we have a new website that we have rolled out everywhere nationally and that's based off some feedback we've been learning in the omni markets. We have some new -- a new search experience. We have some new improvements on our search experience. It's really focused on speed and navigation. And then I think a couple of other factors that played into this. We felt like the supply -- overall auction supply was up a little bit, which is a good thing for us. And I think that was also reflected in a little bit of movement in the new used car gap. So, it really is a whole host of different factors, none of which -- not any individual one was the majority of the lift. Scot Ciccarelli : So, if I were to try and break out kind of like the tax refunds because that's obviously a temporary phenomenon, what was the -- how would you estimate the impact of the tax refund shift? Bill Nash : Yes, like last quarter, I mean, we thought we probably missed out on about a week's worth of tax refunds last quarter, so that's what we expected rolled into this quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Brian Nagel : So, first off, Katharine, congrats on the retirement. It's been -- definitely been a pleasure working with you all these years, so congratulations. Katharine Kenny : Thanks Brian. Brian Nagel : And Stacy welcome. Stacy Frole : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So, I want to -- my question -- my one question, I want to maybe follow up a bit on Scot's question. But if you're looking at the significant inflection higher here in used car unit comps from Q4 to Q1, now you did talk about in the prepared comments some of the shifts in the credit metrics. So, the question I have is to what extent -- as you look at the improvement in used car unit comps, to what extent did either and seemingly more engaged group of lending partners or what -- in what appears to be maybe a little more -- a little looser credit extension on the part of CAF helped used car unit comps? And then along those lines, I mean, to the extent CAF -- it was -- what we see in CAF, was that more of a conscious decision on the part of management? Or was that just a reflection of what was happening in the marketplace? Tom Reedy : Yes. So, Brian, I'll hit your questions. One, the CAF has not changed its origination strategy material at all. We're always testing, but as far as the quality and structure of the portfolio we are originating, it's been very consistent. When you see shifts in the mix, particularly about where -- how much CAF penetration is, that's usually a -- it's generally a byproduct of the mix of customers coming in. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did see application volume up for all credit qualities, but it's definitely more pronounced at the lower end. And so in general, that's going to favor the Tier 2 and Tier 3 folks as far as their attach rate. Now that said, we've seen very solid performance from our partners, both in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space. I wouldn't say it's any different from what we've seen in the last -- saw last quarter and maybe in the third quarter, but Tier 2 definitely improved over the back half of last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing stronger conversion. And Tier 3, if you remember, in the third quarter, we shifted some of the allocation of apps across our partners. And so because of that, we're seeing conversion higher year-over-year. But from a kind of sequential perspective, I think they're all performed about the same as earlier this year and firing on all cylinders and we're happy with their performance. Did that hit everything, Brian or I think-- Brian Nagel : Yes. No, that definitely helps. So, I guess to sum it up, though, I mean, as we look at -- and again, as we all try to make sense of what is clearly a significant acceleration in comps in just over the last few months. Credit was not -- any shifts in credit would not -- what you're saying is that there's -- nothing dramatic happened at the credit side to help that? Tom Reedy : The only thing I would say is the strength of Tier 2 is -- would definitely be a help on -- vis-\u00e0-vis last year because as you would imagine, as you go down the credit spectrum, a customer who gets a CAF offer is much more likely to convert to a sale than a customer who gets a Tier 2 offer, and that's more likely to convert than a customer who gets a Tier 3 offer. So, they're -- with the fact that Tier 2 is seeing more volume and there's -- they're incrementally a little bit stronger year-over-year, you would expect that some of those that they approve that would've gone down to Tier 3 probably wouldn't have turned into sales. But you can't -- there's so many moving parts that you really can't quantify it. Bill Nash : Yes. Brian, and I was just reiterating, if you think about all the different factors, there was no one factor that was the majority of the lift. Brian Nagel : Got you. So, let me just -- and sorry to belabor this. But okay, I'm a Tier 2 piece then, so is there -- can we get any more color on what changed there? And then how -- as we think about now the balance of fiscal 2019, how should we view or think about the sustainability of that? Tom Reedy : I think what I just said a little earlier, over the back half of last year, we saw our lender performance -- so we define lender performance by what percent of applications that they see convert into a sale. So, we saw that conversion increase over the back half of last year and its remained stable since. And obviously, also, there's more customer volume in that space, which favors them as well that we don't control. Brian Nagel : Appreciate all the details. Congrats and thank you. Tom Reedy : Thanks Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Bill Nash : Good morning. Armintas Sinkevicius : When I think about the commentary around Atlanta, double-digit comps again back-to-back quarters now, and you continue to roll out the initiative. How should I think about how that compares versus a -- the traditional model? In other words, as you roll out these stores, how should we be thinking about the lift that you would get from the omnichannel initiative using Atlanta as the template? Bill Nash : Yes, I guess the only thing I can confidently tell you is that every time we go into a new market, the lift is going to be different. And remember, when we rolled out Atlanta, we -- it wasn't only the new experience and the new alternative delivery methods, but we had some new advertising, we had some expanded free transfers, we had some pricing tests, so a whole bunch of things. As we roll out into future market, the only thing I would tell you is that we'll be consistent among future markets is that we'll offer the new experience, the new website experience, the new alternative delivery methods, and we'll absolutely step-up and advertise it. But beyond that, we'll be looking at each individual market and deciding what's best at the time. So, it's really hard to take one market and kind of extrapolate that over all future markets. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. And then just one other one on the SG&A side. How should we think about the timing of the SG&A spend here in the second and third quarter? You're opening up customer experience centers. How much of that is you're starting to see efficiencies at your store level? Or are we opening in the customer experience centers first and then there will be some natural attrition at the store level and also the cost of the grand openings there? Just any way we can contextualize the SG&A that would be helpful. Bill Nash : Yes. So, first of all, for this quarter, as Tom talked about earlier, we had some leverage. Now, there was a little bit of timing and the advertising spend that we would expect to pick up, but as far as the CECs are concerned, we're still ramping them up. We -- I wouldn't say we've really realized much in the way of efficiencies between our CECs and our staffing and the store because we're going through a transition period where we're getting the staffing in the store line up appropriately as we ramp up the CECs. So, I think the optimization from the CECs, we have yet to see that. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. I appreciate it. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi good morning. And I just want to say, it's nice to see Katharine go out on a nice high comp there. So, have a good retirement, Katharine. Katharine Kenny : Thanks. Sharon Zackfia : Yes, I guess the question around the CECs, kind of following up, when you presumably roll out omnichannel across the whole country -- and I'd be interesting in what the timing is on that. I know you said the majority of markets by next February, but kind of what the plan is for the rest? I mean how do you visualize how many CECs are necessary across the country to deliver this experience? And then when we think about those startup inefficiencies, is it really just the labor of those 300 folks at the CECs that's causing kind of that three or four-month inefficiency that I think you've alluded to in the past? Bill Nash : Yes. So, Sharon, we think -- we believe at this point, I talked about the three big ones. We just opened up the first of the three big ones; we have two more that we're going to be opening of this year. We're going to -- I think we feel really good about those three handling the bulk of the country. There will be some probably one-off small locations due to state regulations, i.e., if you have to be in the state to do a selling activity. The CEC is considered selling activity, so you would have to have a location in those states. But I would think about those three as being the major ones that will lift the omni. As far as efficiency, like I said last time, we would expect to take at least one person out of the store for every person that we add in the CEC. Now we've chosen to do that just through normal attrition. So, there will be some inefficiencies by design in the early couple of few months rolling it out because the day we turn on omnichannel, our stores are overstaffed because they no longer have to staff to handle e-Office leaves and calls and progressing customers that way. So -- but I think for the most part in most locations, we can work through that over like a two or three-month period. And we're making sure that we take care of our associates during that time period. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Sharon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Katharine, you will be missed. Katharine Kenny : Thank you. Craig Kennison : So, lots of focus on the omnichannel and disruption in retail channel. And that makes sense to me, good reason for those questions, but there's also disruption unfolding in the wholesale channel. We've got more dealer-to-dealer digital platforms that are emerging there. How are you thinking strategically about the wholesale market and whether there's an opportunity to be as disruptive there? Bill Nash : Yes, it's a great question, Craig. And I think a lot of times people overlook the wholesale, but it's a huge business for us. And I think it's a huge competitive advantage. Just like with our retail customers, we want to make sure we give our wholesale dealers a great experience as well, and so we're testing different things. For example, we've tested some online selling. Keep in mind, though, our average vehicle is still 10 years old, over 100,000 miles. There are a lot of dealers who'd still want to come and look at that, but I think we're in a great position to continue to move and make changes in that space just like we are at retail. So, it's one that we haven't really focused on in this call here, but it's another one of the initiatives. We have several things that we're working on to improve that part of the business as well. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Nicholas Zangler : Hey, guys. How's it going? This is Nick Zangler on for Rick. Congratulations to Katherine. Rick definitely sends his best in that regard. I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the Atlanta market quickly. The unit sales performance, obviously, double digits again. I'm curious if you'd be willing to share whether the spread or the lift, I guess, was maintained in this quarter versus last. Obviously, last quarter you implied double-digit comps. The total company did at 2.8%. Was that spread that we saw -- I mean, obviously, a 9.5% this quarter? Was the spread maintained within that market? Bill Nash : Yes. Nick, what I would tell you is we talked about the double-digit comps last quarter; we have them again this quarter. They did increase a little bit even over last quarter. So, we feel really good about that. Nicholas Zangler : Okay, great. And just your general thoughts on tariff implications on demand for used vehicle unit sales. You believe that this could potentially be even a tailwind as used vehicles are perceived to be more affordable going forward. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes, it's hard to tell at this point, Nick. You probably know as much as we do. That's one that we'll stay close to. Obviously, we're a little bit less reliant on anything coming in from outside of the states. So, theoretically, you would think that's a good thing, but it's too early. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. Nicholas Zangler : Great. Thank you very much guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning guys and congrats Katharine. We look forward to staying in touch. Just -- maybe just one question and it's kind of got slightly two parts. But if we think about what's going on with the CECs in your omnichannel efforts here, Bill, it appears that the business will get more asset-light over time and you might need less stores to cover areas and your current stores might become that much more productive. As you think about sort of the future, I mean, not just this quarter but the future, I mean, how far do you think you can go with these CECs into new markets without maybe a physical presence or a physical presence that may be significantly lower than it has been in the past? And then also, when you think about GPUs in this new world order, can GPUs maybe be significantly lower because the asset intensity might be that much lower and you may still put up the same returns or even much better returns over time? Bill Nash : Yes. So John, the way I think about it, first of all, we feel like -- and I said this in my earlier remarks, we feel like we have a huge competitive advantage with the infrastructure that we've built over the last 25 years. We think our stores are a huge benefit that will allow us to do this omnichannel experience. Now to your question, how do we think about the future and how do we think about physical store growth in the future? We want to continue to grow sales and we want to continue to gain market share and I think it's going to be a combination of adding some additional stores, but it's also going to be leveraging our existing footprint and reaching customers in ways that we haven't been able to reach in the past. And if that means that we get really good at servicing customers that we couldn't service before and it ends up -- if you look at the runway of stores, we have plenty of growth for physical stores. But if you -- if a few stores at the end of that runway get lopped off because we're reaching more customers out of the existing infrastructure, we'd be thrilled with that. So, -- but I do think it's still going to be a combination of the two. As far as the GPU goes, for us, omni rollout and the omni experience is a separate, distinct decision versus GPU and what we charge customers. We don't think that the two are necessarily related. And at this point, we would -- we don't think that there's any reason why we can't continue to progress the omni experience and still maintain our GPUs, but those are two different decision points. John Murphy : But there's no early read of saying, hey, maybe this that Atlanta rollout that we've seen so far and what's going on in Florida, we might be able to reach 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% more customers because of this omnichannel approach. And I would certainly never suggest that you're existing stores are stranded asset, that's -- I think that's silly. I think they're still going to be very productive. But I mean as you go forward, could you -- I mean, would you think about opening material-less stores? I mean it just seems like that's a real opportunity here that you will still use your physical footprint but you may be able to be much more efficient. Is there any early read in what that might be? Bill Nash : Yes. No, it's way too early to know what kind of lift we can get out of our existing infrastructure. But keep in mind; we only have 206 stores at this point. They're all strategically located. We have some areas where we have holes; it would be beneficial to have stores. So, again, I go back to it's going to be a combination, and we'll see how much of a lift we can get by being able to continue to improve the omni experience. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. Good morning and congrats Katharine, we'll miss you. My question is around free transfers. You talked about that being a driver of improved sales in Atlanta. Can you talk about how many free transfers increased in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, for example and whether or not you're rolling out additional free transfers to other markets? Bill Nash : Yes. Free transfers, while we opened it up, it's just not that significant of a factor. And as we roll forward in new markets, we'll make a decision within each market that we roll out. It's not necessarily a play that we'll do every single place. Seth Basham : Got it. And then as a follow-up, thinking about the very wide new to used car spread that we're seeing right now, how much do you think that boosted comps? And do you think it's sustainable? Bill Nash : Well, our data shows -- I think you said very wide, I mean, it's improving. I think we saw some improvement in the latter part of the fourth quarter. I think that improvement has continued. But I would say it's certainly isn't at places where it's been in the past. So, while I think the trend is good, it's just -- I cited it as a thing because I do think it's improving, but again, I don't -- it's just one of the many factors. Seth Basham : Thanks. Bill Nash : Thanks Seth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe research. Your line is open. Jacob Moser : Hey guys, it's actually Jake Moser on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question. Bill Nash : Good morning. Jacob Moser : Good morning. So, I know you said it's a low percentage today, but I'm curious for more color on the uptake of home delivery in Atlanta and how that is trending and where you're think it might get to over time. And then for your recent launches in Florida, are you using the same home delivery process where you have effectively a mobile office with two employees? Bill Nash : Yes. So, as far as home delivery, Jake, it's too early to tell where we think that can go over time. We'll continue to monitor that, but we really don't have any detail update at this point. As far as the home delivery process, the one difference in Florida versus the Atlanta, in Atlanta, we went in with a separate home delivery team. In Florida, we're leveraging -- and as we roll forward, we're going to leverage the existing store associates. We have a new position in the stores, and they'll be responsible for home deliveries as well as express pickups. And just as a reminder, express pickup allows a customer to do everything online, essentially, but still come into the store, take a test drive, learn about the options, that kind of thing. We've done some of those in less than 30 minutes, especially when the customer doesn't really want to do the test drive but just learn about the options. And so those folks will be the ones that handle that. As far as going out, yes, at this point, we still have two associates that will go out. One has the mobile appraisal office -- I mean, the mobile business office, the other will take the inventory unit that the customer is interested in. Jacob Moser : All right. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. I know we had a really awesome quarter here, so I actually want to look at it the other way and just say what, as a management team, are you guys maybe not satisfied with? Or what are you pushing people internally when you address people at the store level or the corporate level? What could you guys actually be doing better right now? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, first of all, the store team is doing a phenomenal job. If you think about all the change that we're going through as an organization, it really does impact every single associate, and the store teams have risen to the occasion. They're excited about it. They're glad that we're continuing to evolve. They're glad we're continuing to meet the business. And so we feel really good about that. Now, I think we have lots of opportunity as we continue to roll this out. We still have a lot of inefficiencies here and we've talked about that in the past, some of them are by design and some of them are just because we've opened up new capabilities. And so what we're excited about, our first push is really get this omni experience out to our consumers. But equally important is it's got to be a great experience for the customers, it's got to be a great experience for our associates. We want to make it as profitable as possible. We want to have the most efficient system available. So there's lots of things that we're focused on with the overall long-term growth to continue to grow sales and market share. So, to be honest with you, I feel great about where we are and I feel great about the opportunities that we have to continue to improve it. David Whiston : Thanks. And just one follow-up there on your comment. When you said a lot of inefficiencies, were you referring to the whole enterprise or the omnichannel rollout? Bill Nash : Well, I think the efficiencies that -- the inefficiencies I talked to are specifically about omnichannel. But I think we have opportunities to continue to look for waste in other parts of the organization. We're never content to kind of be settled with where we are. We continue to push on SG&A, looking for efficiencies there. We continue to look for efficiencies in our reconditioning process. We look for efficiencies in buying logistics. So, I think there's opportunity throughout the whole organization, but I was speaking earlier specifically to the inefficiencies in omni. David Whiston : Okay. Thanks. And Katharine, congratulations. Katharine Kenny : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks guys. Just following Katharine's rule about one question here, so back in the queue. Will, we know there was some debate in the marketplace last quarter regarding what the two-year stack was in Atlanta. So, I guess I was hoping now that we're back in a public forum, if you can help us understand what you've seen on two-year stack basis in Atlanta, specifically where you have the omnichannel rollout, of course, both last quarter and then in this quarter? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. Scot, first of all, thanks for getting back in the queue. You just made Katharine smile on her last earnings call that you actually followed the rules. Yes, so this quarter, positive two-year stacks just like last quarter. I don't think we talked about it last quarter, but we had positive two-year stacks last quarter as well. Scot Ciccarelli : Can you tell us whether this quarter was higher or lower than what you saw in 4Q? Bill Nash : This quarter was higher. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks. And my goal is always is to make Katherine happy. So, there you go. Bill Nash : Thank you, Scot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks. One follow-up question for me. It's just around CAF. Obviously, you experienced some higher than expected loan losses in the quarter. We've noticed some deterioration in trends for selling more recent securitizations. In response to that trend, did you plan on tightening terms for any of your loans? Did you do that this quarter with the lower penetration rate? Or how are you thinking about that going forward? Thank you. Tom Reedy : Yes, the penetration rate this quarter was purely a result of the mix coming through the door. And as I mentioned, the allowanced as it is, is quite a comfortable spot. Obviously, it represents our best estimate of what future losses will be. And so losses trend to that rate. We're very comfortable that we're still originating a highly financeable, highly profitable portfolio, so I wouldn't foresee any changes. Obviously, caveat that with the future is the future and we'll continue to monitor it and adjust as appropriate to the extent it is. But at this point, we're very comfortable. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the conference back over to our presenters. Bill Nash : Thank you, Tiffany. Listen, I'm sure you can tell from our comments today, we're proud of our results and what we're working on. We're excited about the future. The results we discussed today and this goes back to one of the questions that was asked, the results of today are really the product of our associates. It's their hard work, dedication to an exceptional customer experience, desire to innovate and their unwavering commitment to our values, that's the reason we're successful. And so to all of our associates, thank you for what you do every day. It's absolutely an honor to work side-by-side with you. And for those of you on the call, thank you for your interest. Thank you for your continued support of CarMax, and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Frole, Vice President, Investor Relations. Stacy Frole : Thank you, Amy. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings conference call. I am here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid performance this quarter, with revenues up 9.1%, net earnings up 5.8%, and EPS up 12.9%. We achieved a 3.2% increase in used unit comps and a 6.2% increase in total used units sold. The retail performance was driven by strong conversion and continued growth in web traffic. In the second quarter, our website traffic grew 16% year-over-year, which was up slightly from our first quarter. On average, we saw more than 25 million visits per month. Gross profit per used unit for the quarter was consistent with prior year at $2,183. In addition, we reported higher wholesale units with volume up 4.7% versus the same quarter a year ago. This was primarily due to an increase in buy rate. Gross profit per wholesale unit was $928, a 1% increase compared with last year. As a percentage of sales, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles increased to 78% versus 77% a year ago. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 47% of our sales, up from 44% last year. This quarter, we also made significant progress on the rollout of our omni-channel experience and remain confident that this is the future of car buying. This experience, which allows customers to move seamlessly between online channels and physical locations, is now offered to approximately one-third of our customer base, and we remain on track to reach the majority of our customers by the end of this fiscal year. In addition, during the second quarter, we opened two customer experience centers or as we refer to them CECs in Atlanta and Kansas City. These centers are a key component to our new customer-driven buying experience providing help on demand as they serve customers nationwide. Currently, our Atlanta CEC is fully staffed, and our Kansas City location continues to ramp as it begins to support more stores. We also continue to be relentlessly focused on the customer experience and rolling out new capabilities on a regular basis. During the second quarter, we tested and launched new customer progression offerings and enhanced selling tools for our associates. These investments are essential to our vision for the future as they focus on providing a seamless transition between online and in-store interactions, enhancing the experience for both our associates and our customers. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom, and he can provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Tom Reedy : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned earlier, we posted solid second quarter results, including a double-digit increase in earnings per share. This reflects strength across our business, including growth in used, wholesale, and CAF operations along with our ongoing share repurchases. In the quarter, other gross profit increased 8.2%. This was largely driven by a 15% increase in extended protection plan net revenues reflecting the combined effects of our used unit growth, increased margin, and higher product penetration rates. In addition, we recognized $6.5 million of estimated EPP profit sharing revenues. Last year, in Q2, if you recall, we\u2019ve recognized $4.4 million. On the SG&A front, expenses for the quarter increased 6% to $480.8 million or a year-over-year decrease of $4 per unit. Factors impacting our SG&A spend included the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year, which represented a 9% growth in our store base, higher costs associated with our sales growth and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support our core and omni-channel strategic initiatives. Similar to the first quarter, SG&A was light due to timing of advertising expense, which we expect to step up in the back half of the year. In Q3, we are launching a new marketing campaign reinforcing the strength of our brand and highlighting our differentiated omni-channel experience. Additionally, we expect omni-channel investments in the second half will continue to increase as we open our CEC in Phoenix and our other contact centers continue to ramp up. As we mentioned in Q1, we believe it will take comps in the range of 5% to 8% to leverage SG&A for the full year. In the quarter, our provision for income taxes benefited from the impact of stock option settlements by $4.8 million. Now, I will discuss customer finance and CAFs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our third-party lenders. Tier 2 had strong conversion year-over-year accounting for 19.7% of used unit sales compared with 17% last year. Tier 3 was up slightly to 9.6% and CAF penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 42.2% compared with 43.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Year-over-year, CAF\u2019s net loans originated grew by 5.6% to $1.8 billion as the increase in used cars sold and the average amount financed was somewhat offset by the decrease in CAF\u2019s net penetration rate. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.6%, up slightly from 8.5% a year ago. CAF income for the quarter was $114 million, up 4.1% versus last year. The impact of our growth in average managed receivables was slightly offset by the increase in provision for loan losses. Portfolio interest margin for the quarter was 5.7% comparable with the same quarter a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $45.5 million in Q2 versus $40 million in the prior-year period. The increase arises from portfolio growth and a modest increase in the allowance based on loss experienced. The allowance at $150.4 million represents 1.15% of ending managed receivables versus 1.14% in the first quarter and 1.13% the year ago. This remains well within our range of expectations given the origination strategy and our portfolio mix. To reiterate Bill\u2019s earlier comments, we remain committed to aggressively investing in our business, to enhance the experience for our associates and customers, and to expand our market share. During Q2, we opened 3 stores, one in a new market, Lubbock, Texas, and two in existing markets, San Francisco, California; and Phoenix, Arizona. We also anticipate opening 13 more stores over the next 12 months. In addition, we continue to enhance shareholder returns through our stock buyback program. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $128 million, and we have $1.8 billion remaining in current authorizations from the board. Now, I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Tom. Customers continue to tell us they value an omni-channel experience empowering them to shop on their terms whenever and wherever it is most convenient for them. The unique and powerful integration of our in-store and online capabilities provides us with a significant competitive advantage that no other used car retailer can offer at our size and scale. As I mentioned earlier, our CECs play a vital role in supporting our customers with the selection and purchase of their vehicle. We will be opening another CEC in Phoenix in the fourth quarter. As we transition our store e-offices to a more centralized function at the CECs, we expect inefficiencies in the near-term but remain confident in our ability to optimize over time as omni-markets mature and CECs become fully utilized. We continue to believe that this will be a more efficient model than our current. When we launched the omni-channel experience in a new market, the first 4 to 6 weeks are focused on our operational capabilities and ensuring our exceptional customer experience is being fully delivered. After operating capabilities are in place, we bring in marketing and promotional support for the new experience. From that point, we allow a few weeks for our leads to mature from these activities before performance measurements begin. While we are pleased with the experiences our stores are providing in the new omni markets, it is too early to talk about their performance at this time. We understand there has been an appreciation for Atlanta omni updates as it was the first market to launch. I am pleased to say for the third consecutive quarter we saw double-digit comps and the market continues to outperform the overall company in both comp sales and appraisal buys. This is the last quarter we will report Atlanta on a standalone basis. It becomes increasingly more difficult to compare Atlanta\u2019s performance with that of other markets as more stores begin their omni-channel journey and new digital initiatives are introduced nationwide to support the omni experience. Going forward, we will talk about omni more holistically rather than a market-by-market basis. Finally, we continue to focus on leveraging our data to improve our execution and our experiences. For example, this quarter, we focused on vehicle recommendations both online and in-store to help our customers make the right buying decisions. Remember, on an annual basis, we have more than 250 million digital interactions. We process more than 1 million credit applications. We value more than 6 million cars, transport more than 2 million and recondition more than 750,000. This generates a significant amount of data available only to us, a competitive advantage we will continue to leverage. While we are excited about our ongoing initiatives, the key to our success will ultimately come from our interactions and feedback from our customers. Let me share a recent example. This customer lives about 60 miles outside of Atlanta and has a newborn daughter. She didn\u2019t want to waste time traveling with a baby into the city to shop. She is the perfect example of a customer who needed the option to shop on her terms. She started with one of our competitors, but said, she wasn\u2019t getting the help she needed. Then she tried carmax.com and completed an online finance application. A consultant at our CEC immediately reached out to her and on that very same day, we delivered the car to her driveway with a surprise gift for her newborn. She was blown away and said it was the best customer service she has ever received, not the best car buying experience she has had, but the best experience ever. That is exactly what we are going after with omni-channel. It\u2019s our ability to personalize each customer\u2019s journey, whether in person, online, by phone or a combination of channels that provides a truly unique retail experience. We have always been about an exceptional customer experience and I am proud we are continuing to evolve to exceed our customers\u2019 needs. With that, we will be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John, your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys and thank you very much for the detail, particularly about the omni-channel efforts, and that\u2019s kind of what I wanted to focus on. You gave us that one example of a customer 15 miles away from your store, but just trying to gauge if there is \u2013 I know you are going to be short on details here, if there is any way for us to gauge sort of the potential productivity uplift from stores? Give us any metrics around that or maybe simply talk about sort of that customer who was 50 miles away from your store, what is the farthest customer that you have reached with these omni-channel efforts, and how far is that \u2013 I mean, how far do your typical sort of in-store customer typically drive, just trying to gauge sort of the circumference and potentially productivity uplift? Bill Nash : Sure, John. So, first of all, on the mile radius, early on in this, we set a limit on 60 miles, no more than 60 miles from any given store. Obviously, as we continue to expand the experience, stores will start to overlap within 60 miles of each other, so the 60 miles becomes less relevant. That\u2019s kind of where we started with. As far as giving more detail at this point, like I said, it is really early. If you think about it, although we have progressed it to make it available, the experience available to a third of our customers, only a third of those markets has any type of advertising at this point and the other ones that do have advertising has been very short-lived. The other thing that I would tell you is that the connection over to our CECs, there are some inefficiencies there. If you think about it, the first CEC that we turned on was Atlanta, the most tenured associates that we have in there taking calls, they first started taking calls in June. So, it\u2019s a little early to talk about any specific results. But as I said, we plan to continue to update as we go forward. John Murphy : And maybe if I could follow-up, I mean, you said that 60-mile radius, I mean, what is the typical distance that somebody would drive in-store without sort of that defined new area that you are looking at? Bill Nash : There isn\u2019t a typical \u2013 I mean we will have folks that are leveraging test drives that are very close to the store, and then we will have some that are further out, it\u2019s kind of all over. Tom Reedy : Yes, John, when we look at end markets in penetration, we look at 5-mile bandwidth of the store. And as you would imagine, the penetration is significantly higher the closer you are to the stores, and a lot of it\u2019s within a 10-mile band, but we do have customers, as Bill said, that will -- you won\u2019t drive that far for service, but you will drive to get the car you want at the price you want. But as I said, it\u2019s just a lot less \u2013further out you get the thinner the penetration gets. John Murphy : Got it. So, it almost seems like you are looking at something that\u2019s like a 10-mile opportunity going to a 60-mile opportunity? Just seems like \u2013 I mean it seems like that\u2019s generally what your thought process is, that\u2019s my reading? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, we don\u2019t really put the mileage bands. We think omni can help us reach \u2013 we have put 60, but we think it\u2019s going to help us reach a lot of other customers that maybe we weren\u2019t a viable option for them before. John Murphy : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon, your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Yes. Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay? Bill Nash : Good morning Sharon. Sharon Zackfia : Great. I guess just a follow-up question on that, I mean as you have been rolling out omni-channel, what has been the most surprising feature? I mean it seems as if you are really just striving to kind of create a more frictionless environment. So, of the options for the consumer, where have you seen like the biggest uptake in that, and that is \u2013 is it in online appraisals or financing or the delivery? And then corollary to that, when you think about Atlanta, is that comp driven by increased traffic, because people are \u2013 you are kind of lowering the veto factor, because people know what they are going to get when they come in or is that increased conversion, just curious where you are really seeing that comp uplift come from? Bill Nash : Okay, Sharon. So, first of all, on what\u2019s kind of been the biggest, I don\u2019t know if I would necessarily call it a surprise, but as far as what the customers seem to appreciate a lot, I think it really is as we roll omni and we have these new, the new customer hub out that allows the customer to progress on their terms, so they can \u2013 once they decide on the car that they are interested in, it generates \u2013 it puts them into the customer hub at which point they can do pretty much anything that they want to do and be able to do that on their own speed. They also are assisted at any point in the transaction by our customer experience consultants. So, I think that has been very well received obviously with the test drives delivered to their \u2013 to folks home, that\u2019s a new feature. Customers are \u2013 they utilize that, are highly engaged, really appreciated. Keep in mind, it\u2019s still a very, very small percent of overall sales. As far as the Atlanta comps, keep in mind when we rolled it into Atlanta, it was a pure market with very good controls, because when we rolled in there there was nothing omni anywhere else in the U.S. So not only do we put the new omni experience in there, we did some additional advertising, we opened up some transfers, we continue to do pricing tests. And I think the comps are being generated by all of that. Now, from that point, we have taken pieces of this and I have talked about this in the first quarter, we have taken components of omni. So for example, the new website, we moved that into the rest of the country in the first quarter, some of the new technology improvements that we made to the website, the rest of the country has been able to get to that benefit. So, some of the new markets, and it\u2019s the reason why as we go forward, it gets harder and harder to compare Atlanta to a control, because there really is no control anymore. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot, your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Bill Nash : Good morning Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi. Can we talk about loan origination distribution? I guess the way we are looking at, it seems like comps that were originated through CAF were actually down low single-digits with over 100% of your growth coming from your Tier 2 and Tier 3 lenders. Can you just help us understand especially with the \u2013 I know early, but rollout of omni-channel, why comp growth appears to be negative through the CAF channel and maybe what\u2019s changed with your financing partners to accelerate growth there? Tom Reedy : Yes, Scot, I don\u2019t know about comp growth, but if we look at specific units financed by CAF, it\u2019s actually up year-over-year even though it\u2019s down as a percentage of the mix. So in a lot of ways we feel CAF is just going to be a product of the credit quality of the application volume. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into omni at this point, because it\u2019s only in limited markets. As far as Tier 2 and Tier 3, we did see strong performance from them. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with omni as much as the lenders and some factors going on there. In Tier 2, we observed improved conversion from them, which as a reminder, that\u2019s how we evaluate our third-party lenders is of the applications that they see how many convert to a sale. And over the course of last year, particularly in the back half of the year, we saw Tier 2 conversion improve significantly and it\u2019s held strong into this year. So we are looking at a kind of a year-over-year more aggressive lending practice in Tier 2. Tier 3, if you recall in Q3 last year, we made the deliberate activity to switch application volume away from an underperforming lender and more towards a better performing lender and so that\u2019s benefiting us as far as Tier 3 volume this year, but we will probably anniversary that in the upcoming quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : But Tom, in the Tier 2, is there anything that \u2013 was there an addition of new lenders to that program or is it just kind of across the board that, that group of lenders that you use there are becoming more aggressive in terms of seeking to provide financing for you guys? Tom Reedy : Yes, I would say that across the board, it\u2019s not a fair characterization. The reason we maintain a portfolio of lenders is because their behavior has changed. We did see one in particular get a little bit weaker, but a few of them got more aggressive over the course of the year and net-net, the conversion in Tier 2 was up significantly versus last year. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks guys. Tom Reedy : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas, your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Much appreciated. You mentioned that to leverage SG&A you need to grow same-store sales about 5% to 8%. That\u2019s different than the previous mid single-digit growth, but it does seem like the filings callout this year in particular. So can you talk to me about how the plan to leverage SG&A beyond 2020? Bill Nash : Yes. So, I think first of all, the 5% to 8%, we have been talking about that the last couple of quarters, certainly last quarter and again this quarter. We came in a little bit favorable to Tom\u2019s point earlier in his opening remarks, we have advertising spend slated for the second half of the year. So you will see that jump up. The way to think about advertising we think about it on a whole year, because it gets a little dicey from quarter to quarter depending on timing. But as a whole year, we would expect to see advertising on a per-car basis be a little bit higher as we support our omni rollout. As we go forward, we think there is lots of ways to continue to leverage and one of the things we haven\u2019t talked about, you saw little bit of leverage this period, some of that is coming from initiatives that we have done in-house to make sure we are managing control, optimizing our staffing, eliminating waste. So for example, in our merchandising department to make sure we are leveraging our buyers in different ways than we have before, same thing with sales managers in the store. So what you are seeing is some goodness that\u2019s coming from that, that\u2019s offsetting some of the incremental expense that we are investing in the business. I think as we go forward through the next year, I think we have a lot of opportunity to still leverage our CECs, because again, they are just ramping up. I see that as an area of opportunity, because I don\u2019t think we will need to grow the CECs as quickly as we would for sales consultants in stores if we continue the growth by having to staff e-offices, which we won\u2019t continue to do. So, I think there is still a lot of good things that are ahead in-store for us. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. So would you expect to get back to that mid single-digit same-store sales growth to leverage SG&A going forward then or is 5% to 8% the new norm? Bill Nash : Well, I think what we said is 5% to 8% is what you should expect this year. Next year I think you can expect a little bit of a step up in investment, but not as big a step up at this year or at the last year. So, I would expect to get a little bit better next year. And then I think what you will see is it will assuming that we don\u2019t have new initiatives, you will see it start to plateau off \u2013 plateau and then maybe even come down a little bit. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. Much appreciated. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open. Seth Sigman : Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of those last points. So just in terms of the timing of the advertising expense, are you guys able to quantify how much actually shifted out of this quarter into Q3, Q4? Bill Nash : Again, Seth, I would think about it more on an annual basis. If you look at what we spend on an annual basis on a per unit, I would expect it to be up a little bit over what it was last year. So I think last year was running around $220 all-in per unit and I would expect to be above that at the end of this year. Seth Sigman : Got it, okay. And then just two related follow-ups here, just in terms of the initial inefficiencies as you are rolling out the CECs, obviously, it\u2019s very early, but just curious your thoughts on maybe how long does it take to ramp. When do you start to see it breakeven from a cost perspective as you reallocate that labor and experience? I think you have talked about store attrition and waiting for that to happen. And then just related to that, can you just talk about your ability to preserve that top experience that you provide consumers in the store while that labor is being reallocated, just remind us how that all is playing out as you reallocate that labor to CEC? Thanks. Bill Nash : Okay. On the first part of the question about the inefficiency, so a couple of areas that we see inefficiencies right now, when we convert over a new market, keep in mind our stores are staffed currently to handle e-office shifts. So when we turn on omni, they no longer have to do e-offices. So we are overstaffed. We are subsidizing our associates to make sure that we can hold them whole with an opportunity to make more as we allow normal attrition to work through and get us to the right staffing level. Each store in each market is going to be a little different depending on what they go into the omni rollout, where they are from a staffing standpoint, but I would think within a few months, the staffing should be right-sized in those stores if you are looking for a timeframe. As far as CECs, again I go back to something I said earlier, our most tenured person in the Atlanta CEC has only been taking call since June. That is a little bit of a headwind for us right now because there are some stores where they are very effective in their e-office shifts. Well, you are not going to be as effective Day 1 as you will be Day 30 or 60 or 1 year. So I think the e-office as they continue to ramp up, as we continue to train those folks and get more reps that will continue to provide goodness over time. And one of the learnings that we have had coming out of this is we have revamped our training program for the CECs and made it even more robust than what it\u2019s been in the past. And what was the second part of your question, was it about the customer experience in the store? Seth Sigman : Yes, that\u2019s what we are talking about. Just your ability to preserve that experience in the store as consumers still come in, but I think you sort of addressed that? Bill Nash : Yes. We put a lot of focus not only we are turning to CECs, but when we go into an omni market we work with the stores for 6 to 8 weeks before we roll omni, because one of the big things is that we want to make sure this is a seamless integration for the customer. So as they do more online when they come to the store, they don\u2019t want to have to repeat that. They want the credit for what they have done previously. So leveraging the new technology stack that we have that integrates into our CRM system has been critical and so it\u2019s about making sure that our floor sales consultants that are interacting with the customers face to face take the value-add of the system and make sure they understand how far the customer has progressed and give them credit for what they have already done. Seth Sigman : Got it. Alright. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate it. Bill Nash : Thank you, Seth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Derek, your line is open. Derek Glynn : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just as it relates to the recent hiring initiative for auto techs and detailers, can you provide an update on how that\u2019s going, do you think there is ample supply in the labor pool right now to fill all those openings or are you perhaps being a technician shortage in the industry similar to what some of your franchise dealer peers have discussed over the last year or so? Bill Nash : No, I think it\u2019s absolutely \u2013 there is absolutely a shortage of technicians. When I think about the challenging positions that we hire for right now, I would say technicians and fleet drivers are probably at the top. But I would tell you for us, one, our employment brand and being the fact we have been on the 100 best places to work for 15 years certainly helps. We have got great working conditions. We got great benefit. So it\u2019s a great place for technicians to come work. In addition to that, with our whole flow operations, we can grow apprentice techs all the way through the cycle. And so we are starting to grow our own technicians. So we don\u2019t have to rely solely on what\u2019s coming out of trade schools that kind of thing. So we feel good about where we are. We do have a push right now to make sure that we can meet growth as whether that be additional stores or growth that we would expect to see from omni-channel. Derek Glynn : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And if I could just squeeze one more in, just quickly, any impact to call out either late in the second quarter or here early in the third quarter from recent weather events such as Dorian or more recently in Texas? Bill Nash : Yes. So, Dorian did impact obviously our East Coast stores, because it hung out there for a while. We had towards the end of the quarter, at one point in time, I think we had about 14 stores that were closed and it kind of varied there for over a week period as the number of stores we closed as it threatened north of Florida started out, okay, it\u2019s coming to Florida, then you know how it went. So, we did have an impact, but what I would tell you what we believe and what we have seen in the past is although that straddled the quarter, it had a small impact on the quarter results, we would expect to get that back in the third quarter. As far as Imelda, we closed some stores for Houston for a partial day, but really that was less significant than Dorian. Derek Glynn : Understood. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line with Rick Nelson from Stephens. Rick, your line is open. Rick Nelson : Bill, can you talk about GPU as an omni-channel market specifically, Atlanta, how that compares to non-omni channel markets? I know you have talked about some pricing tests in that market specifically? Bill Nash : Sure, Rick. First of all, in general, I view omni and GPU as two separate decisions that we make. They are not necessarily dependent on each other. We can rollout omni and not have to do anything with GPU. As far as it relates to Atlanta, like I said in the past with Atlanta, we did open up some more free transfers, we did some pricing tests. So there was a little bit of pressure on GPUs in that market, but we have pulled back on some of those things. And seriously, as we go forward in omni, we are going to be pulling different levers for different markets. So again, I feel good about where we are in GPU and I do think about them as separate decisions. Rick Nelson : Okay, great. Thanks and good luck. Bill Nash : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth, your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is around trends in omni-channel markets as well. I appreciate the fact that you are not going to speak to performance in omni-channel markets outside of Atlanta, but when you look at Atlanta\u2019s really strong results to-date, where are your projections for the rest of the omni-channel markets, what type of lift you expect from rolling out omni-channel outside of Atlanta? Bill Nash : Yes, Seth. It\u2019s \u2013 look, as I have been saying every market is going to be a little bit different as far as what we expect on lift. We absolutely expect a lift. Do I expect to get double-digit comps in every single market? No, I don\u2019t expect to get it. Do I expect to be getting that in the early stages of these markets? Absolutely not, for all the reasons that I have cited previously, but it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s too early to tell exactly where we think we are going to land ultimately. But as we progress through the next few quarters, we will be able to talk about it more holistically in what we are seeing. Seth Basham : Okay. And I have a follow-up. As it relates to Tier 2 and Tier 3 penetration, you just spoke to the fact that you will be \u2013 you are going to be annualizing some of the strength in Tier 3 in the upcoming quarters. Tier 2 as well you will be annualizing some of the improved conversion you saw there in the second half. Would you expect to see more limited comp contribution from Tier 2 going forward as a result? Bill Nash : No, I can\u2019t predict what the lenders will do over the course of the next year. So, it\u2019s hard to say what will happen going forward. But as I mentioned, we did see improvement over that course, mostly the back half of last year and it was more of a trend unlike Tier 3 which was a step function, because we changed our policy of allocation. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris, your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to talk about like the supply environment, wondering if you are funding \u2013 obviously comps are very strong right now, so that wasn\u2019t the case, but wanted to get a sense for what you are seeing in terms of inventory availability, if you had a more difficult time yet sourcing productive units that fit your standards? And then two how do you think about that backdrop given off-lease growth beginning to decelerate in the back half and then kind of plateauing into the next couple of years? Thank you. Tom Reedy : Sure, Chris. As far as auction supply, we think there is a good supply. I cited that as the strength in Q1. I think the supply is still good. We don\u2019t see an issue there. When I look at the comps from Q1 to now obviously in Q1 there were a lot of different factors that I cited the tax refunds. You had the \u2013 the lending environment is good. We had great execution. We have rolled out some of the digital things that we had gotten from omni. The other thing that was interesting about Q1 was not only do we see a good supply, but the acquisition price for the first time was fairly flat year-over-year and we hadn\u2019t seen that probably in a year and a half or more. When I go to the comps of this quarter, there certainly was a headwind, because our acquisition price actually went up a few hundred bucks over last year which was already up $400 to $500. So that was a headwind and a headwind that we worked through. As far as the question on the lease ship, I think the leases from every measure that you look at and what I read, sounds like the leases may peak this year and then start to decline, but truthfully we have seen this cycle before where leases make up a decent share of what\u2019s being sold and then they gets pulled back. And generally what happens is there is something else that fills that void. So maybe dealer consignment will go up, the SAR staying relatively flat, which means instead of leases, people are buying cars. So we will just skip those vehicles through other channels. We have been able to work through that historically and I think we are in a great position, because we have done it before that this time will be no different. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up, when I think like the strength of your model, I think one of the underappreciated assets is kind of, I think your CAF book and then like your lending partners. I have historically observed that when like the auto environment credit conditions tighten, your comps accelerate. I guess, a) do you see this in your own data and then b) how would you characterize the overall auto lending environment currently? Thank you. Tom Reedy : Yes. We haven\u2019t looked at whether \u2013 how our comps trend with the overall auto lending environment, but \u2013 and we really concern ourselves with our sales and our partners and what they are doing. In CAF, we worked really hard to maintain a book of business that\u2019s highly financeable that securitization market will appreciate and we lend to the standards that allow that \u2013 that will allow that to happen. We haven\u2019t seen anything in the current environment that\u2019s made us want to tighten our standards; no red flags at this point. So, I feel good about that. I feel great about our Tier 2 partners and their performance over the past year. That\u2019s why we have a portfolio of them and we haven\u2019t had a tight lending environment in a while, but when we did on an ongoing basis, we heard from our partners that they preferred the business coming out of our system than other places and actually took volume down in other places in order to keep doing CarMax business. So we continue to focus on those partnerships and hopefully it pays off in the long run like it has in the past. Bill Nash : Hey, Chris. The only other thing I would add to that is it really is about affordability. So as prices go up, customers are focused on their monthly payment. So, changes in interest rate and acquisition prices, all that kind of plays together. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one versus the other. So if new cars are going up faster than used cars and even if the financing environment isn\u2019t as tight, customers are focused on that monthly payment, what does that equate to from a monthly payment standpoint? Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, so that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for the context. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David, your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk at all in terms of your self sufficiency ratio? Is there anything in the digital \u2013 on the technology front that might help you guys meaningfully increase that ratio over time? Bill Nash : Sure. So we have talked about our self-sufficiency ratio is usually in the 40% to 50%. We are a little bit less than that for this quarter. That certainly is a focus area. We continue to advance some of our tests with online appraisals, online estimates, trying to figure out what resonates best with the companies, but it certainly is a large focus and we will continue to buy as much as we can through outside channels other than the auctions. David Whiston : Okay. And on the CAF penetration being down in the first half of the year, about 230 bps is that \u2013 Tom, is that primarily with the more aggressive lending from the channels that you were talking about earlier or is there another factor driving that? Tom Reedy : No. As you guys probably know, we did first look at all of the loans. So, CAF runs its business as a key fit to try to optimize its profits and CarMax\u2019s profits. So a change in our third-party lender behavior would not impact our book at all. It\u2019s really a matter of what kind of customer application credit mix is coming through the door and our ability to convert those folks. And actually we are doing a good job on a year-over-year basis of converting them. It\u2019s just a matter of what\u2019s coming through the door. David Whiston : Okay, thanks. Tom Reedy : Or the web. I am sorry I was antiquating myself here. David Whiston : Yes, right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot, your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up on the financing side here, is there any kind of difference in the distribution that you are seeing from the omni-channel than the stores on the financing, like is CAF I don\u2019t know, because I am not actually in the CarMax store, for example, maybe I am choosing a bigger bank or a lender that maybe I am more familiar with? Bill Nash : Yes. I think Scot, at this point, we have seen similar whether it\u2019s in the store or through omni-channel, we have seen a kind of a similar credit makeup. Really the only difference that we have seen is when you start doing online finance, I think the folks that utilize on-finance is more skewed towards lower credit customers. But outside of that, it\u2019s pretty similar to the stores. Scot Ciccarelli : But Bill, does that mean that as we expand the omni-channel, more people are using the web to do their credit apps, because that\u2019s obviously a growing trend, you would naturally tier more, shift more towards those kind of second and your Tier 2 and Tier 3 lenders rather than CAF? Tom Reedy : No. Scot, I think what Bill is trying to articulate is people that are leading with the credit app as their first interaction with us that volume is significantly lower credit than our overall transactions in omni. If you look at people who transact with us in omni, it\u2019s similar to the mix that we see in the rest of the system. I think it\u2019s just the folks that have good credit don\u2019t lead with that, because they know it\u2019s not an issue and they will deal with it later in the process. Bill Nash : Right. Online financing has been available for quite a while, even before omni. My point was just more specific of the folks that use that feature, it\u2019s generally lower credit. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, got it. Alright. Thanks, guys. Bill Nash : Alright. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you. Listen, we are excited about the future. We are a 26-year old company. We just hit $5 billion in revenue for the second quarter in a row. Revenues were up 9%. EPS is up almost 13%. Comps are north of 3%. We are investing heavily in the business for the future. We are buying back stock. We are managing costs. So we are very excited about where we are today. We are excited about the future. But it all goes to our associates. They are the ones that are enabling this. None of this would be possible without their dedication and drives. They are delivering that exceptional customer service and living our values day-in and day-out. They are the ones that are driving what\u2019s possible for us. I want to thank them. For everyone else on the call, I want to thank you for your continued support of CarMax and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to take a moment to personally congratulate Enrique on his recent promotion to CFO. Enrique and I\u2019ve worked together for many years, and he\u2019s made a lot of great contributions during this time. I also want to thank Tom for serving as our CFO for the past nine years. I\u2019ll look forward to continuing to work with him as he shifts his focus to our strategic initiatives, in addition to continuing to oversee all the finance. For today, I\u2019ll start with our third quarter highlights before turning the call over to Enrique, who will discuss our financials in more detail. Tom will then provide additional color around customer financing. And I\u2019ll wrap up with an update on our omni-channel experience before opening it up for your questions. As you read in earnings release, we delivered a strong sales performance this quarter with revenues up 11.5% on a 7.5% increase in used unit comps and 11% increase in total used units sold. Net income and EPS for the quarter were down 9% and 4.6%, respectively. This is largely the result of significantly higher stock-based compensation due to an increasing share price during the quarter, combined with a planned increase in third quarter expense due to the timing of advertising. As a reminder, volatility in stock-based compensation expense is driven by restricted stock units that are awarded broadly to our non-executive associates. Enrique will provide additional details on these items shortly. Keep in mind, despite these third quarter cost headwinds, year-to-date comps were up 6.7%, EPS is up 10.1%, earnings are up 3.6%. And while we have delevered SG&A by $37 per unit, this includes $42 per unit of stock-based compensation. We attribute our sales growth to a variety of factors including solid execution in operations, finance, customer progression and marketing in addition to an overall favorable used car sales environment. Web traffic increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to benefit from our various marketing efforts. During the third quarter, our markets offering an omni-channel experience had slightly stronger comp sales in our non-omni markets. The strong performance in both was supported by many of our omni-related digital initiatives that have been rolled out nationally. This includes improved customer lead management tools, finance self-service tools and digital merchandising. And we believe all stores benefited from our national marketing campaign launched in October, which reinforces the strength of our brand. For the quarter, gross profit per used unit was $2,145, up slightly when compared with the prior year. Our teams have done an exceptional job in continuing to drive efficiencies, allowing us to maintain margins while offering competitive prices. Wholesale unit sales were also higher this quarter with volume up 3.3% year-over-year. The increase in wholesale volume was slightly offset by a small decrease in gross profit per wholesale unit due to heavier depreciation at auctions since the beginning of the third quarter. As a percentage of sales, zero to four-year old vehicles was 77%, similar to last year. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 49% of sales, up from 45% last year. At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on the third quarter financial performance. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, other gross profit decreased slightly. EPP profits grew by $11 million with 13.3% due to the combined effects of strong used volume growth and increased margin. Like the prior year, we did not recognize any additional EPP profit sharing revenue. This increase was offset by an $11 million decline in service department profits for the quarter versus a year ago. The decrease in service profits was largely due to three factors. First, we increased our post sale warranty period from 30 to 90 days back in May. We view this as an investment in providing a better customer experience. Second, we experienced near-term inefficiencies due to a sharp ramp in technician hiring support future sales growth. And finally, a portion of stock-based compensation runs through the service department. On the SG&A front, expenses for the quarter increased $75 million to $485 million. SG&A deleveraged by $157 per unit. A material component of this growth and the resulting deleverage was driven by stock-based compensation. $11 million or 25% of the overall year-over-year growth in SG&A on the quarter was due to the 17% increase in our share price for the quarter versus a 15% decrease in the prior year period. This resulted in a $94 per unit deleverage to SG&A and represents $0.09 of EPS. We also had a planned increase of $14 million or 39% in advertising costs for the new ad campaign and the rollout of our omni-channel experience that Bill mentioned earlier. This spend on the quarter brings our year-to-date advertising expense per unit to $225. On a year-to-date basis, this is slightly higher than last year and consistent with our earlier communications that our intention is to spend slightly more per unit for the full year. Other notable expense drivers included the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the third quarter last year which represents a 10% growth in our store base. Higher variable costs associated with our strong sales growth and continued spending to advance our technology platforms, digital initiatives and our omni-channel roll out. During this period of investment, we continue to believe comps in the range of 5% to 8% will be needed to leverage SG&A on an annual basis. As part of our expansion strategy, we opened four stores in the third quarter, two in new markets, Palm Springs, California and Gulfport, Mississippi, and two in existing markets, Dallas and Atlanta. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate opening 11 more stores. Earlier this month, we also opened our Phoenix Customer Experience Center or CEC. We continue to enhance shareholder returns through our repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $115 million. This program has contributed to our 10% year-to-date EPS growth that Bill mentioned earlier. We have $1.67 billion remaining in our current authorizations.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss customer financing. Tom Reedy : Thank, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. CarMax Auto Finance and our partner lenders continued to deliver solid results with CAF income growth and strong conversion in Tier 2 and Tier 3. During the quarter, we saw modest growth in application volume and strong performance across all credit tiers. Tier 2 accounted for 20.4% for used unit sales compared with 18.3% last year. Tier 3 was up slightly to 9.5% compared with 9.3% a year ago, and CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 43.3% versus 44.1% in last year's third quarter. Year-over-year, CAF's net loans originated grew by 13% to $1.7 billion as the increase in used cars sold and the average amount financed was somewhat offset by the decrease in CAF\u2019s net penetration rate. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.1%, down from 8.5% a year ago and 8.6% in the second quarter. Portfolio interest margin increased to 5.7% versus 5.6% in Q3 last year. CAF income was up 3.9% to $114 million, primarily driven by the 7.5% growth in average managed receivables and a small increase in interest margin, offset by an increase in the loss provision as a percent of average receivables. The provision for loan losses was $49 million in Q3 versus $40.8 million in the prior year period. The increase arises from portfolio growth and a modestly higher allowance based on loss experience we began to see earlier this year. At $153.6 million the allowance represents 1.15% of ending managed receivables, up slightly from 1.12% a year ago and comparable to the second quarter. This remains well within our range of expectations, given our origination strategy and portfolio mix. Before I turn the call over, I will touch on the impending Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard, which is commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will be effective for us at the start of our fiscal 2021 and a number of you have inquired about it. This is a non-cash accounting change and won't impact our previously disclosed cumulative net loss expectations. The most significant element of the new standard is that it requires companies to reserve for the expected lifetime losses, whereas currently we reserve for the following 12 months. As a result of the adoption, we will increase our allowance for loan losses by $200 million to $250 million. This is based on information as of November 30, 2019 and the adjustment will flow through retained earnings. Post adoption, CECL could also create more volatility in the quarterly provision for loan losses as any true-ups will be projected over the life of the portfolio versus the 12 months we're currently estimating. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thanks Tom and Enrique. Now, I'll provide an update on the rollout of our omni-channel experience, and how we are continuing to innovate and improve the business for the future. First, the numbers. We now have four CECs that we continue to staff, Raleigh, Atlanta, Kansas City and our newest in Phoenix, which opened earlier this month. Approximately 40% of our customer base currently has access to our omni-channel experience, and we are on track to reach the majority of our customers by the end of this fiscal year in February. We plan to complete the rollout in the next fiscal year. ESP penetration in our omni markets is slightly lower than our overall penetration, which is a little above 60%. We have not seen a material change in finance penetration or mix with the rollout of omni. We are pleased to achieve 7.5% comps while at the same time, implementing the largest transformation in the Company's history. While we continue to run some inefficiencies in both our CECs and stores, we are confident we will be able to improve productivity as we roll out and mature the new experience. We also still believe our unique omni-channel experience will be more cost efficient than our current model. We've already begun to drive cost efficiencies in our Atlanta CEC quarter-over-quarter. We are also excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to improve our customer offerings. Two key areas where we see opportunity are our Customer Relationship Management or CRM platform and our new delivery options. Our CRM platform enhances the experience for both our customers and our associates. It provides associates with valuable insights and data about our customers that allow us to better personalize their experience. It provides customers with the access to our customer hub. This hub makes it easier for customers and our sales associates to have full visibility to the status of their journey and to continue to progress further, while either online or in store. We also see tremendous opportunity with our express pickup and home delivery offerings. Our conversion rate on these sales is very high and the customer experience these delivery options is extremely well received. While combined they still represent less than 10% of sales in eligible markets, these offerings steadily increased throughout the quarter. Going forward, we expect more customers will take advantage of these delivery offers -- options as we expand our omni-channel experience into new markets and increase customer awareness through various marketing channels. Our associates are doing an amazing job and structuring and delivering a systematic yet aggressive rollout of the new omni experience, an experience that personalizes each customer's journey whether in person, online, by phone or a seamless combination of channels. Our ability to leverage the infrastructure, analytics and processes we have built over the last 26 years and continue to improve with state-of-the-art technologies and new digital capabilities is a significant competitive advantage, an advantage that when combined with our ongoing store expansion, positions us well to continue to lead the industry, profitably grow sales and gain market share. I'm extremely proud of our associates and all of their accomplishments and we're all excited about the future. With that, we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys, and happy holidays to you. Bill Nash : Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Can you guys talk about the change that you had in your service policy, specifically what caused you to make that change, the 30 to 90 days? And was there any financial catchup in the quarter or is this more of a reset that will continue for the next few quarters? Bill Nash : Sure, Scot. So, for the longest time we had a 30-day limited warranty program. And as Enrique said, we changed that over in May to 90 days, and we feel like that's best for the customer experience. So, what you're seeing is that it\u2019s -- now that it's everywhere, it's been in place since May, it's this -- from an expense standpoint, it's a couple of dollars per unit that's a little bit of additional headwind. Scot Ciccarelli : And so, we should expect, let's call it, similar effect to that service department revenue for the next three quarters, let's call it? Bill Nash : Well, keep in mind, when Enrique was talking about the service profits, there is really three different buckets that are going in there. Part of it was the shift from 30 days to 90 days, and of that, I would say that's about a third of the overall change, another third was stock-based compensation and the other third of the staffing inefficiencies that we see, because we're ramping up our technicians. And as we ramp up technicians, until we get a critical mass, it's hard to turn on new shifts. So, each one of them make up about a third. And on the 30 to 90-day warranty, of that third, about half of it is a little step up on a per unit basis of the expense. We also had in that third a mix shift, where we did more 90-day warranty work in retail service work. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And just for clarification purposes, the 90 days, does that basically put you at par with the CPO -- most CPO programs that are out there? Bill Nash : I'm not sure about the CPO program, Scot. I would have to go and look at that. I think that we feel like 90 days is certainly best-in-class for used cars. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Enrique Mayor-Mora: That's a program that will anniversary itself in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as we rolled it out in May of this past year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : So first off, Enrique and Tom, congratulations on your new roles. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thank you. Tom Reedy : Thanks. Brian Nagel : So, the question I want to ask, I guess, my first question, really just from a bigger picture perspective. Clearly, the business has turned much healthier here lately with used car unit comps in this quarter tracking at over 7%. So, Bill, as we look at this, as we look at the improved trajectory in used car unit comps, how should we think about -- and maybe you could help us understand better the split, so to say, between -- the data we're looking at suggests the overall environment has gotten better, maybe with some help from used car pricing other factors. But, you also clearly have a number of initiatives taking place at CarMax, a lot of these tied to the omni-channel. So, how much of this strengthening used car unit comps is internal versus external? And if you look at maybe the internal side, what should we think as the kind of the bigger drivers of all that you're doing? Bill Nash : Yes. That's a great question, Brian. As I noted earlier, it is part of great execution. It's also some favorable environment. When I think about the favorable environment, obviously, favorable access to credit -- new car prices at an absolute level are still high, although in the quarter, we seem to see a little bit of narrowing of the new to used car gap, but the absolute prices of new cars are still high. You've got low unemployment, you've got good consumer confidence, inventory build that I said. You\u2019ve got those external factors. But, I also salute a lot of the internal factors, especially from an execution standpoint, when you look at buying -- acquiring the right car at the right price, especially in a time where we saw depreciation that we would normally see in this time of year. Our operations teams continue to find efficiencies in ways that we can pass along to the customers. The customer progression, both in-store and online, we've made great strides there, moving customers along, online in our CECs, we've got new tools that we started to roll out to help our new associates there. CAF executed well, supporting sales, driving CAF margins and still offering great customer offers, we've got the marketing campaign that launched. And as we look at it, there is no one factor that's the majority of that comp growth. I really do feel, we really believe that it's a combination of all those factors. Brian Nagel : Got it. It's very, very helpful. Then, my follow-up -- my related follow-up question, just with regard to the marketing expense you called out here in Q3, which was somewhat of a headwind to earnings. How is the new marketing campaign -- or how should we look at the new marketing campaign as an enhancement to what the changes you've already made to marketing, over the past few quarters? Bill Nash : Yes. I think, periodically we rework our marketing. This was a big change. We have a new outside agency, between the outside agency and our internal team, I think they've done a great job really bring it to life, not only our brand, but also the omni-channel experience in those markets. So, as you've seen in the past, when we go with the new marketing campaign, if you look at the last one with Andy Daly, we run that for a while, we build off of that. I would think that this marketing campaign, the same type thing will continue to build off of the strength of this. And as we go forward, you will just continue to see this new campaign versus running ads on all campaigns. In the third quarter, I've talked about this on previous calls, in the first and second, we knew that we were going to be heavy on the backside of the year. We ran light on advertising as a matter of fact. Through the second quarter year-to-date on a per unit basis, we were spending less than what we spent last year on an annual basis. And I've said all along, we're going to spend a little bit more to also help market our omni-channel experience. And I think, as you look at where we are now year-to-date, Enrique cited earlier, we're about $225 per unit, slightly above last year. And I think that's a good proxy. We will be slightly above where we finished the year last year. We still expect that's where we will come in, on a per unit basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. Question on SG&A. There's obviously a lot of moving parts in there this quarter. And, I appreciate the commentary on the 5% to 8% to leverage comps, I guess, going forward. Can you talk about whether that 5% to 8% would be applicable for the fourth quarter? And then, as we go into fiscal 2021, I know there is still continued investments in omni-channel, but does that start to abate somewhat in terms of the incremental spending and in efficiencies that you're seeing? Bill Nash : Yes. Enrique will take the first part. I'll take the second part. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. On a quarterly basis, there is so much -- there can be so much variability that when we refer to the 5% to 8%, it's on a longer annual basis. If you take a look at this quarter between stock-based comp and between the advertising timing, that alone caused us to deleverage. So, within any particular quarter, it's difficult to say. But certainly on an annual basis, that is our expectation. Bill Nash : Yes. And Sharon on the second part of your question about what you should expect to see in the New Year. I've said earlier in previous calls, last year was a step-up year. We expected this year to be another step-up year. Next year, we expect it to be a continued step-up year but less to a degree than what you've seen from a growth percent, less so than what you saw this year or last year. And of course, we'll provide some more direction in our fourth quarter call when we're back here, then. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made on the call. The development of the CRM system and making it more advanced, so there's more data available to your sales team. And I'm just curious, is there an intention to maybe go more proactively and market sales directly to individual consumers to drive same-store sales, as you're developing that CRM system, or is this more just as people come in and inquire about vehicles, you just have more information to help out the process? It just seems like there may be an opportunity here to get more directed advertising going. Bill Nash : Yes. I think, when I think about the CRM, the CRM is more of a tool to help our associates, whether they're in the customer experience center or in the store. I think, the beauty of the CRM is we collect data and we can analyze data. We can do what we call smart routing to make sure that we handle those leads -- how we handle those and who handles those leads, we're becoming much more savvy of that, which is one of the areas that I'm excited about as we go forward, continuing to pick up efficiencies. As far as being able to directly target more customers, we've already shifted that way. When you think about our total advertising spend, probably half of it is more on a digital advertising, which is much more pinpointed than what I would call traditional advertising, which is more of the broadcast TV, radio type of stuff. I do think that the data that we're collecting from the CRM can assist us in helping to target future customers, but I kind of think about them in different buckets, if that makes sense. John Murphy : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the express pickup and in-home delivery. You said a little bit less than 10% in the eligible market. So, it sounds like it\u2019s somewhere between 5% to 10%. I mean, would you call those folks that are doing the express pickup and in-home delivery incremental consumers or buyers in your stores or is there some kind of cannibalization? Just trying to understand what's incremental and what's cannibalized? Bill Nash : Yes. At this point, I would say, it's probably both. And when I look at those two, we're doing more express pickups than we are home deliveries, at this point. It's interesting because sometimes we'll have customers that think that they want to be home delivery and then they start working through the process and they realize, you know, I'd like to come in and test drive a couple of cars, and so they convert over to in-store. The express pickup, just as a reminder, that allows a customer really do everything online and still come into the store, get their keys, if they want to take the car for a test drive, maybe learn about the options that we can have them out in less than 30 minutes. So, I see both those -- as I said earlier, I see both of those as continuing to grow as we mature the experience and also as we highlight the mix -- the experience in our marketing efforts. Operator : Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Thank you for taking the question. 7.5% same-store sales growth year-over-year, that's quite a strong number. How do we think about how much of that comes from a favorable used car sales environment versus how much of that comes from the omni-channel rollout? Any way you can help us contextualize that that would be very much helpful. Bill Nash : Yes. As I said earlier, there is a lot of different factors. I don't think any one of those factors is the majority. So, I don't think necessarily the favorable environment is a majority when you add all those things I talked about earlier. I think, a lot of these execution things that we highlighted, I think, the -- especially the digital initiatives improvements that we've made as part of omni and rolled that out to the other locations that don't have omni, I don't think -- we don't believe any one of them lines up and has the majority of that lift. It's really a combination of all of them. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. And when you talk about lift, does that mean versus the comp a year ago or just the 7.5% number itself? Bill Nash : When I think about that 7.5% number and what contributes to that performance, that's what I'm saying, I don't think -- we don't believe in any one of those items is the majority of that 7.5%. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, I want to tell you that my daughter contributed to your comp this quarter. We had a great experience. So, thank you for that. Bill Nash : That's great. Thank you, Craig. Craig Kennison : Yes. It was a good experience. We didn't get to do the internet omni-channel experience yet, but I'm sure that will come. The question I had was on your recon business or your recon work. You always seem to drive cost out of the reconditioning process. Has that trend continued? And as a follow-up, is it still your policy mostly to return that to the consumer rather than trap some of that in the gross profit line? Bill Nash : Yes. Craig, to answer your question on giving it back to customer, yes, at this point, we like passing that along to the customer. It helps make the prices as competitive as possible. The reconditioning, we continue to look for efficiencies there. I would say the area that we're seeing a little bit more improvement on is more of the procurement. So, think about parts, that kind of thing, we've equipped our associates in the field with certain tools that allow them to buy the right part at the right time, at the right expense. I would also tell you picking up some efficiencies in our transportation, as we move more vehicles with our internal and dedicated fleets, that helps as well. And then, of course, I always put an emphasis on our buying, because that's really when you think about price competitiveness. It really starts with where you purchased the cars. And I think, the buyers have helped to make sure that we are buying them at the right price and the right time. The other thing I would just say is that, not only does it help us be competitive on prices all those savings, but it also helps us manage our margin and keep that stable as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Rick Nelson : So, the New York Fed this week pointed to a higher rejection rate for auto loans. I'm curious, if you see any need for tightening of CAF? I did notice a shift toward the Tier 2 and Tier 3 finance providers away from CAF? Bill Nash : Rick, could you just repeat the first part of your question, please? Rick Nelson : So, the New York Fed this week, they had a report out that pointed to higher rejection rate on auto loans. And I'm curious, if you need to tighten CAF? Tom Reedy : No. I think, as I mentioned, we've seen real strong performance from both our partner lenders who are originating in our system, which is as Bill mentioned, providing a little bit of a lift year-over-year. And in CAF, we saw losses tick up a little bit earlier in the year and our increased provision this quarter kind of reflects that's just going at that run rate that we've been experiencing in all year versus a little bit more favorable environment last year. But, we've seen no need to adjust our credit appetite. We're still generating portfolio that we're very comfortable with and happy with the business. Rick Nelson : Also, on the GPU front, another solid quarter. You talked about gaining leverage from omni-channel? Is your intent, Bill, to pass those -- that leverage on to the customer to drive more volume or does that spend... Bill Nash : Yes. Right now, the leverage that I referred to on the call was we started to see one of our -- the oldest customer experience in Atlanta, customer experience, we started to see some cost leverage there. And that would really show up more in the SG&A line versus the GPU or passing along to the customer in the form of the price. So, you'll see that show up in SG&A savings. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Glynn from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Derek Glynn : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We had a follow-up on the home delivery attach rate at a little less than 10% of sales in omni-channel markets. Where do you think that steady state number is? What percent of your overall sales do you think home delivery can be in the long run? Bill Nash : Well, just for clarification, Derek. The 10% that I cited is both home delivery and express pickup. And express pickup is home delivery. So, it\u2019s higher than home delivery. So, both are still, if you take each one individually, very small percent of our overall sales. But, as far as where I think it can go, to be honest with you, I don't know. But, to be honest, it doesn't really matter to us because we're there to support the customer and give them the experience they want. So, if more want home delivery, great, we\u2019ll be able to satisfy that. If they want to come into the store, we\u2019ll be able to satisfy that. So, I don't know where it's going to go. We did see -- throughout the quarter, we saw more people leveraging express pickup and home delivery. But, I don't know what the top end of that could be. Derek Glynn : And then, just as a follow-up, as we think about your SUV and truck mix, I would think that follows a pattern unfolding in the new market with the mix of those vehicles is much higher. To what extent do you view that as a tailwind to your ASPs? And is there any opportunity or appetite to take more price drive higher GPUs? Bill Nash : Remember, when we look at GPUs, it's not driven by the expense of the car. That's not -- we don't make necessarily more money on a more expensive vehicle. As far as how do we see this going forward? The truck mix, I think, and I'd have to go back and confirm for sure, but the truck mix has been ticking up a little bit. And that's more representative of what's coming into the marketplace, either through our appraisal lane or through the outside auction. So, I would continue to see that that pattern exist in the upcoming quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. My question is on new vehicle leasing as a substitute to buying a used car from CarMax. I think, leasing has very much peak for the cycle but it\u2019s -- in the past, there's been some very attractive offers to the consumers. So, do you see new vehicle leasing as less of a substitute threat than say 12 months ago or is it about the same or\u2026 Bill Nash : Well, I think, the industry data would say that this year probably the off-leasing vehicles will peak -- between this current year and last year, there'll be at a peak level. As far as where we think leases might go next year, again, it would be a shot in the dark. I'm certainly not a leasing expert. But, wherever it goes, whether leases continue to persist in the next quarter or if they drop off a little bit in the next quarter, inventory availability for us will still be in good shape as far as acquiring inventory and as leases -- the peak of off-leases come down, there will be something else that fills in that spot. I mean, we've seen this cycle run many times over the years that we've been in business. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : First question is on advertising, the step-up. Was most of this incremental spend distributed nationally, or was it more targeted to where you have omni-channel markets? And then, two -- sorry. Bill Nash : I'm sorry. Go ahead. Finish your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. Then, I was just like kind of -- related to that was kind of like, as you push more online, have you rethought like what the right advertising budget is, maybe advertising more makes more sense, I'm just curious how you think about that. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. The majority of the spend on the quarter was actually the national spend, not the omni-market spend. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I wanted to talk more about the wholesale business. You talked about like the web traffic looks great, you talked about lower -- like your unit growth was great, but then talked about lower appraisal traffic at wholesale. So, A, wanted a sense for what you think drove that. Is the competitive environment for trade is getting more difficult, just given were we are in the cycle of competitive threats? And then, two, can you talk about the supply of the 8 to 10-year old vehicles that should be increasing, has that manifest the way that you thought it would have earlier in the cycle. Bill Nash : Yes. So, Chris, I mean, I think that it's been -- there has been robust competition for what we would consider A lane vehicles. I mean, a lot of different dealers are focused on trying to buy more outside of the auction. But, that's nothing new. The comments I made earlier about wholesale was more around GPU. And with that, the GPU went down a little bit, but that's more of a function of what we saw in the marketplace from a depreciation standpoint as the vehicles depreciate and we put less on the offer, which also has an impact on buyer rate and volume. So, we had a little bit of pressure on buyer rates, still up around 30%, little over 30%. So, we're still pleased with that. But anytime you have a depreciating market, it puts a little headwind on your offers which then puts a little headwind on your volume. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, it certainly makes sense. Did the number of wholesale locations change this quarter? It looks like you closed a couple, but I might just get the way on reading the schedule. Bill Nash : No, we did not close any auctions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Stock-based comp was a big headwind this quarter. You mentioned some additional stock compensation to service line associates, which is captured in SG&A, but are you also giving more stock-based comp to associates that would be captured in that SG&A? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Stock-based compensation, the majority is going to be in SG&A, but there's also components in service profits as we mentioned related to service associates, it\u2019s also a component related to CAF as well. But, by far the largest component is within SG&A. I think, it's also -- it's just important to emphasize again, this is our broad-based equity program, it's targeted at non-executive management, settled in cash and runs through the P&L. Bill Nash : Yes. And Seth, just to also clarify, we didn't increase that program. It's not like there were more shares or anything out there. It's just the market volatility to change from quarter-over-quarter. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you for that clarification. And then, secondly, as it relates to the performance of your comparable store sales overall relative to your omni-channel markets, you mentioned omni-channel is slightly better. That sounds a little bit different than what you're describing. The omni-channel outperformance in prior quarters, is that A, correct; and B, is that surprising; and C, is it still a good investment, if you're not getting a big lift on those omni-channel sales? Bill Nash : There is a lot of different questions in that one question, Seth, but I'll try to do my best to remember all of them. You have to keep me honest. But, is it surprising where we are, absolutely not. I mean, if you're comparing it to what we have seen in the Atlanta market, it is different than that. But, I said all along, look, every market's is going to be a little bit different. We're going to have different levers that we pull. I actually feel really good about where we are with the omni rollout and the comp contribution to that. Because right now we have a headwind in our omni markets as it relates to our customer experience centers. If you think about it, when a market rolls onto to the omni -- the omni experience, the day it rolls on, we turn the e-offices in the stores. While the e-offices have been manned by associates that have been around a long time, they know what they're doing when it comes to progressing customers. We now turn them on to the customer experience centers. And I would just remind you that our customer experience centers, the most tenured associates that we have working with customers has only been doing it for about six months. So, as we continue to roll out and we continue to stand up and open these new customer experience centers, the Kansas City one, the Phoenix one, you have a lot less tenured associates that are handling the customer progression. I think, it's a great opportunity for us and it's one of the things that I think about when we think about efficiencies going forward and productivity gains. But, I feel good about where we are given that our omni markets actually have a headwind working against them. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you very much. Happy holidays, guys. Bill Nash : You too. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Carol. I want to thank all of you for your interest in CarMax and for joining us today. As always, our success is because of our associates and the culture that they have created. I want to thank them for what they do every day, for driving what's possible for each other, for our customers and for our communities. I want to wish all of them and all of you all a happy holiday. And we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered record used vehicle sales and EPS for both our fourth quarter and full-year results. And we did this while maintaining attractive GPUs and undergoing the largest transformation in our company's history. For calendar 2019, we also grew our comp market share of 0 to 10-year-old vehicles to 4.7%, which was an increase of 4.2%.  While we're extremely proud of this performance, given the rapidly evolving and unprecedented time that we currently are in, we are not going to repeat the earnings commentary included within this morning's release. Instead, we would like to take this time to focus on the current environment and answer any questions you may have.  First and foremost, our thoughts are with our communities, all of which have been affected by the coronavirus. I also want to thank those who are battling this pandemic on a day-to-day basis.  Over the past few weeks, we've put significant measures in place to reduce the risk of exposure and further spread of the virus in our communities. The health and safety of our associates, customers, and our communities are very important to us.  We are following the mandates of public health officials and government agencies, including the implementation of enhanced cleaning measures, social distancing guidelines, and in many localities closing our stores.  Our team has also done a great job in mobilizing our associates at corporate locations to work remotely from home with only a critical few remaining in our offices. During this challenging time, we remain committed to living our values. We're current providing pay and benefits for up to 14 days to our associates who have been impacted by store closings or required to be quarantined. In addition, we are assessing options for those to go beyond 14 days. We also continue to give back to our communities by supporting our national partners in their response to the coronavirus.  Regarding our business, approximately half of our stores are currently closed or running with limited operations. We have a central response team in place, developing and implementing plans for multiple scenarios as this is a dynamic situation with new store openings and closing daily.  Our goal is to keep our locations open as long as possible to support the essential needs of our customers, while also providing income to our associates. Throughout this time, we will constantly monitor and operate according to the requirements provided by each locality. As noted in our news release, our omnichannel experience was available to approximately 60% of our customers. For our remaining markets, we're pivoting and implementing the most relevant parts of the omni experience, such as online self-progression and curbside or express pickup as quickly and broadly as possible given the current needs of our customers. While not our usual practice, we're providing insight into March sales to allow visibility into current conditions. In all of my years at CarMax, I've never experienced a month like we had in March, which was the most volatile month I've ever seen. The positive momentum experienced this past year carried into the beginning of the month with robust comps through the first week of March. Since then, the coronavirus situation within the US has rapidly escalated and our sales have dropped significantly.  Over the past few weeks, approximately half of our stores have closed or are running under limited operations and consumer demand has progressively deteriorated. For wholesale, approximately one-third of our auction locations are closed due to state mandates, and almost half of our wholesale vehicle sales are now taking place online.  Advancements in technology have enabled us to quickly move sales to an online platform, and we will be moving all sales online in the coming weeks.  For both our retail and wholesale GPUs, we anticipate pressure for a period of time as we look to right-size our inventory levels in light of the current environment.  At this time, we're unable to fully quantify the size of the impact as it largely depends on the duration of store closures, which is constantly changing; consumer demand; and how large the changes are in the underlying valuations.  We are the largest buyer and seller of used cars in the US, and we believe it is important that we keep our appraisal lanes open where possible, so that customers who want or need to sell their cars can. We will continue to leverage our professional buyers and proprietary algorithms to ensure we are offering our customers the right price at the right time in this dynamic environment.  As we focus on managing our national inventory, I want to emphasize our diversified business model, with a powerful store footprint in sophisticated logistics network and a huge competitive advantage.  In addition, we have been through challenging times before and we know the experience of our associates and strength of our inventory management systems are instrumental as we need to quickly and efficiently move cars out of markets, where stores and auctions are closing.  We've always said that it's our associates, culture, financial stability, and operational excellence that set us apart, allowing us to expand our market share in all economic cycles.  We believe the proactive steps we're taking today will help us withstand the current environment and emerge from this crisis as an even stronger company. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our business continuity efforts as it relates to CAF, and he'll be followed by Enrique who will speak to our financial stability. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. While the situation in the nation and our stores is unprecedented, those who have followed us over the years know that this team has dealt with similar circumstances in the capital market.  Recent focus at CAF and our consumer finance group has been on our associates, our customers, and our funding channels. As Bill mentioned earlier, our teams have done an excellent job in mobilizing our associates to work remotely, while responding to the increasing demands of our customers. For the few whose work requires them to be in the office, social distancing guidelines are emphasized at CAF. During these uncertain times, we are endeavoring to do what is right for our customers. In this environment, we understand some customers may need help. We have in place a variety of measures at CAF that we believe will support our customers during difficult times, while enhancing the long-term collectability for the portfolio. This includes suspending repossessions, waiving late fee for March and April and providing additional loan payment extensions when available upon request. As one would anticipate, origination volume tracked with our sales performance during the month of March, starting out strong and then decreasing as stores closed and demand slowed.  At this point in time, we have curtailed our in-house tier 3 lending, but have made no changes to our core lending standards as it is too early to identify any specific trends and customer demographics in credit mix. However, we're watching it closely.  Not surprisingly, in the second half of March, we did experience an increase in delinquencies and a greater demand for payment extensions. At this point, we're not able to predict the future impact on portfolio performance. But we'll continue to analyze the data as it becomes available.  In either case, we will continue to balance the needs of our customers, while maintaining quality portfolio. Obviously, we'd expect some unfavorable loss experience as well, but similarly, it's much too early to determine the overall impact on the quarter.  As we discussed on our last call, the new current expected credit loss accounting standard, commonly referred to as CECL, is effective for us as of March 1. The CARES Act passed by Congress last week provides temporary relief from applying the CECL standards for some companies. Given the current environment, we're evaluating whether we're eligible for this relief and if we would elect to adopt it just to defer our adoption of the standard. Additional information will be available in our 10-K filed later this month.  We expect our customers will continue to have a variety of options to finance their vehicles purchases through CAF and our partner lenders. Lending partners have indicated they intend to continue supporting the CarMax channel. As I've mentioned many times over the years, our partners have historically told us they prioritize CarMax business in capital allocation decisions, mostly because they experience superior performance from our superior origination channel, but also due to our long-term focus on relationships.  We ended FY 2020 with $1.3 billion of unused capacity on our warehouse facilities, an amount that could support CAF activity for several months, particularly in the current sales environment.  And while the public ABS market is currently disrupted, we see the feds recent actions to bolster liquidity in the credit markets, including bringing back TALF as encouraging.  In any event, we're actively assessing alternatives, similar to the creative solutions we employed during the Great Recession should the ABS market remain disrupted for an extended period of time.  We are fortunate to have finance teams that have navigated crises together in the past. We believe we have the expertise, resources and partners to help us work through this challenging and ever changing environment.  Now, I'll turn over the call to Enrique to discuss our financial strength and flexibility. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. CarMax's competitive advantage lies in the combination of our focus on associates, strength and diversity of our business model, our ability to manage through challenging times and our strong balance sheet. This positions us well for when the economy rebounds and should position us to further distance ourselves from our competitors. At the end of the year, our adjusted debt to capital ratio was at the lower end of our targeted range of 35% 45%. Not being highly levered provides us with flexibility that is beneficial to have in the current challenging environment. We have always been focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with a strong liquidity profile. We've done this to maintain flexibility in our capital structure, and to help shield us from potentially difficult macroeconomic environments. Let me give you a current liquidity snapshot as to where we stood at the end of March. As of March 31, we had approximately $700 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. More than $300 million of unused capacity on our revolving credit facility, and more than $2.5 billion of inventory. We also own the real estate and buildings in more than 140 of our locations across the country, with a net book value in excess of $1.8 billion.  From a debt perspective, we currently have approximately $2.5 billion of long-term debt consisting of approximately $1.1 billion outstanding on to our revolving credit facility, $800 million of senior notes and term loans, and approximately $535 million in financing obligations, largely related to sale leasebacks on select stores. It's important to also note that we have no near-term maturities as the earliest is in 2023. As you can see, we are in a solid financial position. However, in the current environment, it's also important for us to manage costs in the shorter term for the reduced sales levels and limited visibility into the future environment.  We've shown an ability in the past to make the prudent decisions to ensure the long-term health of our business and to protect cash flows even in challenging times.  We intend on carrying the same approach to the current, albeit unprecedented, situation Accordingly, we have already begun taking measures to preserve cash with specific steps that will best position us to emerge in strong financial health. Over the past few weeks, we have been reducing inventory levels, pausing on most capital expenditures, and aligning operating expenses to the state of the business. At the same time, we're ensuring that we're building in sufficient flexibility, so we can capture the rebound in sales when it arrives.  Prior to the coronavirus, it was our intent to open 13 new stores during fiscal year 2021 and a similar number of stores in fiscal year 2022. We have paused on store expansion activity and our remodels until situation stabilizes.  In addition, while we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders, the current environment dictates that we halt our share repurchase program. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Tom. As you heard us say numerous times today, the situation is dynamic and changing quickly, sometimes by the hour and by locality. But our diverse business model and recession tested team has a long track record of prudent decision making to ensure the long-term health of the business. It will be difficult in the near term, but as Enrique mentioned, we are financially strong and we believe we are taking the appropriate measures to ensure we will withstand the current conditions and be in a favorable position when the economy and consumer rebound.  In addition, we shouldn't overlook that we came into this crisis with a rock solid foundation. We produced record vehicle sales and EPS in FY 2020 and we did this while maintaining attractive GPUs, expanding our market share and undergoing the largest transformation in our history. FY 2020 was a great year and we look forward to building on the success in the future. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Hope everyone's doing well down there in Richmond and healthy at this point. Bill, I think everyone pretty much understands that the world changed pretty significantly in early March. And of course, you're dealing with half your stores being closed on top of what I would think is a pretty broad consumer paralysis for big ticket purchases. So, with that being said, I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more color quantification on what you've seen over the last few weeks, as I think that context would probably be helpful for investors. Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure. Thank you, Scot, for the question. Yeah, let me give you a little color first of all on the store closures. So, like I mentioned, about half are closed on limited operations currently \u2013 and I say currently because it changes by the hour, it's a very fluid situation. We have approximately 70 stores that are completely closed. We have another approximately 25 or so that are modified operations. And so, when you think about that, think about modified operations, as primarily it's appointment only. So, the consumer can't just show up at the location. All the rest of the locations are all impacted by this because of social distancing guidelines, which are set by each locality. So, for example, in some stores, you can't have more than 10 customers in the showroom at any point in time. As far as adding a little bit more color on the sales, all of the open stores are substantially off on sales year-over-year over the last two weeks. Most of the stores that have been opened during that time, so for the last two weeks, are selling 50% or less than 50% of what they sold last year.  Now, I don't think that should be a surprise to anyone because I think, during that time period, pretty much 70% to 80% of the US have been told to stay at home. So, given that, consumer demand has been progressively going down. So, hopefully, that color adds a little bit. Scot Ciccarelli : Yeah, that's really helpful. And can I just clarify something that you brought up on the GPUs, the gross profit per unit pressure comment? Are we talking like a couple hundred dollars, but you're still making a positive spread? Or is this more like selling cost or even below cost because you just need to liquidate inventory and generate cash? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yeah, Scot. It's really kind of too early, because we're really talking about the last two weeks. If I go back to the Great Recession, I think during that period, we had a couple hundred dollars. This albeit is a very different \u2013 it's kind of unprecedented. So, at this point, it's really hard to tell you other than I'm sure we'll come under some pressure. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. Bill Nash : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Thank you for taking the question. As I think about the world pre-coronavirus and post-coronavirus, we were thinking SG&A would be up year-over-year in fiscal 2021, albeit a lower magnitude than fiscal 2020 because of the omnichannel expansion. Now, you mentioned pausing capital expenditures and store openings. How should we be thinking about the expansion of omnichannel? And sometimes, it makes sense to push with the expansion because customers aren't coming into the stores. It makes sense to try to reach them in other ways that they see fit, but if you could help us think through your pace, if you've accelerated, paused, slowed down and the impact to SG&A as well. That would be helpful. Bill Nash : Okay, sure. So, look, if we talk pre-coronavirus, as we were coming into FY 2021, I think what we had said in the past, FY 2020, we needed 5% to 8% comps. And if we had come into FY 2021, just only continue our focus on omnichannel, we felt like we could actually do a little bit better than that assuming that we weren't doing some other initiatives. And to be frank, we were planning on doing some other initiatives. So, it would have still taken probably a 5% to 8% comp to leverage for FY 2021. Obviously, we're in a different world right now. As Enrique talked about, some of the things that we're doing. I agree with you on the omnichannel expansion. We're going to continue to push forward on that. As I said, we're going to focus on some of the things that are most relevant in this environment first. And I think what might help a little bit is explain how we've been doing our rollout and how it's going to change. So, historically, when we've been rolling out omnichannel, it's been very systematic. We've got a great change management and process. We generally start the process six weeks beforehand. We go in, we train the managers, we train the associates. And then, it's a very systematic rollout as we continue to ramp up our CECs, our customer experience centers, so they can support those ways.  Obviously, the in-store training is out the window at this point, but the stores obviously have less volume, so we can focus more on training, which is why we're going to go as quickly as possible to make sure that we get, first of all, the customer self-progression. So, that's the hub online that really allows a customer to do the whole transaction or as much as they want to online ahead of time, as well as the express pickup, which in all cases, we're calling it the curbside pickup, but think about it as what we used to refer to express pickup where customer can do everything online, they can swing by the store, and previously they could take the car for the test drive, they can come in and sign any few documents that remained. We're now calling it curbside because literally they never have to come in the store. They can come, the car can be waiting there for them, really touchless. We want to make sure we get that rolled out everywhere and then we'll continue to ramp up, make sure that the CECs can support. But in the interim, you've got some stores that are going to be doing what the CECs are doing until we get that ramp up. So, we'll get everyone there. Our goal coming into this year was to finalize the rollout. We're just approaching it in a different way Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. So, you're not so much changing the pace of the rollout and sort of your end targets. You're more changing how you're approaching the process, it sounds like. Bill Nash : I'd say, the pace we are changing that we're going to be putting out these two features as quickly as possible. We want to have curbside pickup in all of our locations within the next week or so. So, we are pushing some pace on some of these things. But we're going to continue to roll omni. I'm really pleased with the fact that we started this investment both in the technology and the whole omni experienced several years ago. I think given the current situation, having these alternatives for customers, albeit the volume is down low, it's going to be really important. And we see customers on a daily basis for a variety of different reasons and they need reliable transportation and we want to make sure that we give them an experience that they feel safe in transacting with us. Armintas Sinkevicius : Got it. Much appreciated. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I'm hoping to get some more color on what you're seeing in the asset-backed market. And having lived through this before, I guess, 12 or 13 years ago at this point, how would you compare and contrast what you're seeing currently versus 2008, 2009 and how much liquidity do you think you have? Obviously, sales are down. So, that kind of extends your runway. But based on your current rate of sales, how long can you kind of go before having to tap some sort of additional funding? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. Hey, Sharon. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the \u2013 I guess if you could call it silver lining is, at the reduced sales pace [indiscernible] on how much capital we need in order to keep funding CAF. And so, as I mentioned, I think we believe there's several months of runway there before we need to access some additional type of funding. Now, that said, you asked about the ABS market. Currently, it's disrupted. I do think that the government has taken action much quicker this time than last time around. If you remember, 2008 and 2009, we were blocked, potentially locked out from the public ABS market for over a year. And during that time, we were able for the first year to cobble together transactions with partners and lending banks to fund CAF originations through all of 2008 before TALF kicked in and then we did a couple of TALF deals.  So, it's really hard to draw conclusions on how this will compare to that. But I think we're hearing of activity and interest in the ABS markets. I'm confident that \u2013 we've been here before. The same team is working on this. We'll use every tool at our fingertips to keep things going. But we've got all the plays we did during the recession. We're looking at all those type of activities. Hopefully, it doesn't come to that. But I feel very good about us being able to continue to provide funding for our customers, like we did during the Great Recession across the credit spectrum. Bill Nash : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Good morning to everyone. First off, I hope you're all well. And also, I do want to congratulate on a very nice fourth quarter before all this mess started. So, I've got a couple of questions. I want to shove them into one.  Okay. So, first off, with regard to \u2013 Bill, you talked about some of the actions either you're taking or you may have to take with regard to valuing your inventory. The question I have there is, and I'll make sure I ask this correctly, is this more a function of \u2013 as you look at revaluing this inventory potential in the environment, is it more a function of accounting? Or is it to reprice these cars to try to move them quicker in a very dampened sales environment? So, how should we think about there, just the flow of those cars?  And then, the second question, I guess this is much more for Tom on the CAF side and as a follow-up to some of the prior questions, so as we look at this right now and you've mentioned that the securitization market is disrupted, so has CarMax so far skipped what would have been a normal securitization? And if you had, could you do a securitization right now at potentially less favorable terms. Thanks. Bill Nash : Hi, Brian. So, first of all, thank you for the comments on the fourth quarter. I tell you, the team here feels like that was a year ago since the fourth quarter given everything that's happened, but I do appreciate the recognition. As far as valuing inventory, I think at this point, Brian, it's more about making sure that we have the cars priced appropriately to make sure that we're moving them versus accounting at this point. Our auctions are a huge competitive advantage. We can stay on top of kind of how things are being priced, what they're going for. So, as you know, we always try to make sure we continue to move our inventory, so we can replace it with cheaper vehicles. But keep in mind, some of our stores right now are on lockdown. And so, we have some inventory sitting in some stores that we can't get access to, although that's even changing daily. So, it's more about making sure that we get the price right and moving it.  And then, you want to talk on the ABS? Tom Reedy : Yeah. Brian, if you look at the cadence of how we've originated in the past, you probably would have expected us to be coming to market with the deal sometime this month, several weeks from now. Obviously, we're keeping a close eye on the market, not likely that we do something in the next week or two. But as I mentioned, I think we've got a good amount of runway with our current facilities. And there are a number of alternatives we have to make sure that we can be funding customers, keep credit available to them. And when the markets do open up, and we can drop a deal in there. Bill Nash : Hey, Brian. I think the other thing, just going back on the inventory just for a second, we're really focused on all inventory, so not just saleable, but raw and work in process, getting the overall number down, not only to keep the inventory flowing and to get it to the right level. But keep in mind, because we own all that inventory, that's also additional cash flow that comes in. So, I think that's an important piece to remember as well. Brian Nagel : Thanks, guys. Appreciate all the color. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. It's very good to hear from you guys. And thank you for all the very helpful disclosure. It's actually really helpful. Just a question as we think about the ABS market potentially falling and just sort of your understanding of how TALF 2.0 is going to work and how much that will break the logjam because it sounds like it's going to be very powerful.  And then, sort of just the follow-up to that ahead of time is, when you think about the existing pools out there for CAF, how do the defaults, but importantly, the waivers work on monthly payments because I would imagine that might trigger something in the existing ABS pool? And are you getting waivers inside those pools to have consumers skipping payments? How does that mechanically work? And does that create any issues for you? Bill Nash : Okay, I'll hit both of those for you. I'll try my best. Now, as far as TALF, I'm hoping that \u2013 we're hopeful that that's not what it comes to. That was a great tool back in 2009 to free up markets that had been seized up for a long time. It's a, frankly, a great deal for investors that are interested put enough capital. You can look at how it works. We don't know all the details yet, but we'd expect to be very similar to what was rolled out in 2009. So, it does create liquidity, but it is a cumbersome process both for investors and for issuers. It's not an easy transaction. But to the extent that the markets remain locked up, it was something that definitely was a remedy back in 2009. Like I said, we're hopeful that we don't need to go there. We have other alternatives that we can embrace as a bridge if we need to. As far as the various pools and the activity with extensions, those tools really don't have \u2013 as you know, they're non-recourse deals and they're structured based on the cash flows of the various pools receivable. And they pay down CAF's \u2013 the receivables are paid off. So, to the extent that we have extensions, what that means is that you're going to have a delay in the pay down of the loans. But the pools are structured, so that they go lockstep with the actual amortization. There's no debt amortization schedule on the deal. So, from the perspective of public deals, they're out there. We've got the initial capital invested in them. And obviously, we're very intent on making sure that we maximize the residual coming off of it because that represents CAF income, but they're structured to stand on their own and play out of course as the cash flows come in. John Murphy : So, there's no triggers or any risk whatsoever if defaults or payments are waiting for a period of time at all. The risk at the end of the day is that we don't collect our residual cash flow to the extent we initially intended. But there could potentially be some reputational risk if you have pools that don't perform. But as I mentioned earlier, it's non-recourse and there's nothing that we'd have to come out of pocket or do to save them.  Now, the reputational risk, I think is a little bit kind of moot because CarMax will not be the only person in this boat, to the extent that automobile ABS deals start to get compromised. And if you remember back to the Great Recession, we saw significant step ups in losses. And we didn't see any deals fail. Everyone got paid including us. John Murphy : Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys. And good luck with everything going on here. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask, first off, if you can remind us back in 2008, 2009, how high did bad debt expense get in relation to the overall size of the book, maybe if you can remind us of that. And then, the follow on was just for CapEx as well as fixed versus variable in SG&A, so what should we look at for CapEx this year, assuming it can't just go to zero because probably some has already committed. And then, secondly, fixed versus variable in SG&A, how much potential reduction could you do and what's the timeline to do those kind of reductions given the unprecedented environment? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Good morning. This is Enrique. So, let me start with a CapEx question. So, historically, we've spent about $350 million in CapEx annually. And given the current environment, we're not prepared or in a position really to give guidance, but I can give you some color. So, a couple of things. We've put a pause on the majority of our capital expenditures from new stores. We've paused our new store expansion. We've paused our remodels. And we've really paused work that is not currently essential from a CapEx standpoint. So, if it's essential, we're doing it. If it's not, we're on pause currently. So, in terms of providing guidance on CapEx, we're not in a position currently to do that, given the limited visibility. As visibility grows and we'll be in a better position to do that.  In terms of expenses, we really are managing to the current state of business. So, for example, we have a hiring freeze in place. We've been cutting advertising. We're adjusting labor hours, we're really at this point evaluating every and all expense and spend. In terms of fixed versus variable, the way we've looked at our business historically has been about 75% fixed, 25% variable. However, what I'd say is that in this current state, everything is on the table. So, you can take a look at the fixed bucket and say, well, we're looking at that as well. So, let me give you some color around that. So, marketing historically has been viewed as a fixed cost, while we're currently taking a look at the spend there to make sure we're matching the current business environment as well. Bill Nash : And by the way, the only thing for \u2013 I'll let Tom talk about the ABS. On the CapEx, if you go back to 2008 and 2009, I believe, we ran about $20 million on kind of maintenance capital. So, obviously, we had less stores down there, but that kind of gives you an idea that we can take that number down substantially, although to Enrique's point, we're not going to really provide guidance at this point.  And then, can you repeat your question\u2026? Tom Reedy : Michael, were you asking about how the loss has trended in the pool during the Great Recession? Michael Montani : Yeah. And I'm sorry if I'm missing this, but you guys I know had done a change in the accounting from kind of gain on sale. And I just wanted to make sure kind of we all had the benefit of incremental color around how the book performed during that time, in particular with losses. Tom Reedy : Sure, yeah. If you look at the pools that originated leading up to the Great Recession, we saw losses roughly double from where they \u2013 we tend to target \u2013 we typically target 2.25% to 2.5% loss experience over the life of the loans. We saw some of those pools roughly double during the Great Recession. As I mentioned, all the deals remain intact and everyone received cash, including ourselves, throughout that period. The other thing I guess I'd point out is, immediately following that period, and I'm not making any predictions now or how long the period might be, the pools that we originated immediately following that disruption were some of the best performing from a loss perspective that we've had. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. And good morning. My first question is just in terms of the warehouse availability today. You mentioned $1.3 billion end of February, but where are you today on that? Bill Nash : We're a couple of weeks lower than that. But as I said, I think we're still comfortable that we have good runway on it. As I mentioned, several months. Seth Basham : Okay. And if you were to sell a loan today in the marketplace and some sort of other transaction besides the ABS market, do you think you'd be able to sell those at a premium?  That would be speculation, but my gut would be that, yes, I think \u2013 I look at the kind of the cast of characters, the things that we did back when capital was constraint during the recession. All of them were less attractive than our than our plan A, which is originating and going into the ABS market and keeping all of the upside. Anytime, you start getting into hold on sales or partner type of transactions, people want a share of the returns, so they're going to be a little bit less attractive economically. But that's something we'll consider as we balance our options going forward. Seth Basham : Got it. And then, my follow-up is just around the cash burn today. If you could give us a sense more quantitatively about how much cash you're burning on a weekly basis, that would be really helpful. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. As we said in our prepared remarks, we are in a financially strong footing. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have solid liquidity. And we feel confident that we are actually taking the necessary steps in this kind of environment in terms of pulling out cash, pulling out costs. We're not exactly sure how long the current situation will last. But we are striving to put ourselves in a position to come out of this in a financially healthy environment \u2013 situation, sorry. Seth Basham : Very good. Thank you. Good luck. Bill Nash : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question as well. Many have been addressed already. But could you please characterize used car prices since the outbreak? And then, as an unrelated question, just comment on the strategy behind the Edmunds investment. I know it's not a virus topic, but still curious about that. Bill Nash : Sure. So, on the first question on kind of the depreciation, it's interesting, if you look at some of the NAAA data, it was fairly \u2013 from January through February, it was fairly strong, more from an appreciation standpoint. So, we saw vehicles normally rising at this time of year and it was fairly strong. You get into the middle of March, and what we saw was a very sharp decline. And back in 2008 and 2009, we saw a very big decline throughout that whole year where there was a concentrated decrease from like August to November of 2008. I think this, what we've seen in the beginning of February, the middle of February and later, has been a very precipitous decline like that. Now, we don't know how long it'll go on. And again, as I said earlier, depends on store closures and that kind of thing. But it was a sharp decline starting from about the middle of the month. As far as Edmunds goes, you know that we've been focused with \u2013 the whole omnichannel, we've been focused on engaging with our customers, shopping, letting them shop online, and really giving them more control and independence. And part of that is making sure we have expert advice and guidance. And Edmunds is a very trusted, unbiased resource. They have lots of extensive automotive editorial and research data. And they've also been investing a lot over the last couple of years in digital innovations, and it aligns with our continued focus on enhancing the customer experience online. So, we feel like there's lots of synergies between the two companies. We've already tapped into and working with them on some content and putting that on our car landing pages, but we think there's lots of opportunities that will benefit both companies. And as we progress in the partnership, we'll have more to talk about at a future point. Seth Basham : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. RickNelson: Thanks. I'm curious, you push online and curbside pickup into those stores over the near term, will that allow you to open those stores that are currently closed and reduce inventory at a quicker pace? Bill Nash : Yeah, it's a good question, Rick. So, what we're seeing currently, generally what happens is a mandate will come down, everyone needs to close. And we immediately \u2013 we closed because a lot of times the mandates aren't exactly clear as it pertains to us. Most localities that close have carved out automotive service and sales, but many of them have stipulations. So, for example, you can open \u2013 you should be open, but you should only allow appointment only. We do think that with the curbside and the push to online, it's going to make it very much easier to work the appointment only type of locality. So, we're encouraged by that. And to your point, if you can get those locations up and at least somewhat productive, it helps from an inventory standpoint. RickNelson: Just a follow-up, [indiscernible] auction side as you push virtual, do you think those auctions that are closed can open up? Bill Nash : Yes. So, again, just like the stores, you have a couple of different situations. You have some auction locations like the stores that are completely closed down and the localities haven't even made it available to get the inventory out. You have other locations where you can get the inventory out. And when we're able to, we do that. We'll move it to another location where we will do an online sale. So, I think that's one of the reasons why we're pushing. We've talked about in the past testing simulcast, testing online. And this has just positioned very well to move very quickly on this to make sure that we can continue to liquidate inventory as well as understand what's going on in the marketplace. So, the onlines will help us to get those vehicles sold even if the store locations are closed. RickNelson: Thanks. Bill Nash : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Glynn from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Derek Glynn : Yes, hi. Good morning I hope you all are well. Bill Nash : Good morning, Derek. Derek Glynn : How do you think the used to new value equal will evolve for the consumer in the context of this economic shock? And also, in an ultimate recovery, would you expect to see a notable shift in demand from new to used similar to what we've seen in past downturns? Did you feel this is a completely different type of downturn that may throw off that relationship we've seen historically? Bill Nash : Yeah, Derek. I tell you it's a tough question. Coming in from the fourth quarter, what we saw was the new to used spread widen. So, I think that was a little bit of a tailwind for late model used vehicles. I think in this current environment, I've seen some numbers projections on SARS. It's going to be down dramatically, I think, for this year, given some of the numbers that are coming out from the manufacturers. I think part of it's going to depend on what the manufacturers do from an incentive standpoint as the consumer start to rebound. But as I've always said, the wholesale market is very quick to self-adjust. So, if used car prices come down because of incentives, an increase in incentives, that will ripple into the wholesale market and the wholesale markets will adjust quickly, which is another reason why you want to manage your inventory very quickly. Derek Glynn : Okay, got it. And then, apologies if I missed this, but can you remind us of any relevant covenants we should keep in mind, particularly around maximum leverage ratios and how you're thinking about that? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah, we have two main covenants. We have a leverage ratio covenant and we have a fixed charge coverage covenant. And those are calculated on a 12-month look-back basis. So, as you know, from our year-end report, we had a very strong past 12 months. So, we have a lot of cushion there. In fact, we could double the performance of those two ratios and still be well within the cushion. Derek Glynn : Got it. Thank you, guys. Best of luck. Bill Nash : Thank you, Derek. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up questions. So, I just want to understand, for this discussion again, just the flow of inventory here. As far as acquisition goes, are the auctions open now and is CarMax in those auctions buying cars? It sounds like from your prepared comments, you're still where possible taking trade-ins. So, I guess, the bigger question there is just the auction. Then the second question I have, and I know this is more of a touchy feely type question, but given that CarMax is now much more digitally focused, much more omnichannel and you have a better reading of your customers, is there any way to look out and say makes a ton of sense right now that the consumers in this sort of state of paralysis, but is there still \u2013 is there a way to measure kind of the underlying \u2013 the true underlying demand for cars? Are consumers still looking for cars to maybe help us gauge how demand will look once this hopefully temporary shock passes? Bill Nash : Okay, Brian. So, first question, are the auctions still open? Right now, the two major auction players, ADESA, Manheim. ADESA is closed right now for the time being. So, there are no sales happening. Manheim is still open, but everything is virtual. Your question, are we still out there buying? Yes, we're still out there buying, albeit at a very reduced rate, obviously, because of consumer demand. Yes, we still have our appraisal lane open in the stores that are open for the reasons that I said earlier. There are customers who just need to get cash and get out of their car. So, we want to make sure that we're there for that.  As far as the omni focus and kind of consumer demand, every day, I'm in touch with the stores. And every day, I hear stories about who's coming into the stores right now. And so, the folks that are coming into the stores and buying cars today are the ones that absolutely have to have cars. Just to bring it to life a little bit, you have medical providers that need to make sure that they can get to work. We've seen customers come in who have lost their jobs and need to downsize their car, and so they're selling a car and then downsizing the car, or they're just selling their car to get cash. You see customers that have relied on ride sharing that no longer feel comfortable there and they want to buy a vehicle. So, the consumers that are in there today are ones that need a vehicle. You're not having consumers come in who would like to have the vehicle at this point. And I think that's similar to what we saw back in 2008 or 20090. I think as far as the demand going forward, it really is going to depend on a couple of things. I think, one, how quickly the country \u2013 how we can get our arms around the virus is the first and foremost. And then, even after that, I'm sure you've seen some unemployment numbers. Consumer confidence obviously is taking a hit with so many folks that are unemployed. So, it's really hard to understand what the demand is going to be once we come out of this and how long it will take for business to get back to normal. Again, it's just the reason why I'm really glad that we have invested in the technology and we have invested in the omni experience to make sure that the customers that are out there that are looking for a vehicle, we can meet them on their terms and give them the experience that they are looking for, which I think that will help us to continue to gain market share regardless of the economic cycle. Derek Glynn : Thanks for the color again. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Derek Glynn : Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to ask about some of the initial experiences from the CECs, what you all have been able to learn there, how that process is going. And then, related question is on remote appraisals, kind of where we stand in that process. Just trying to look ahead here and see if there's some things that you're doing now that, incrementally, would benefit you on the other side of all this? Bill Nash : Yeah, absolutely. I think both of those are \u2013 we're going to continue making progress on both of those. As far as the CECs, we're very pleased with the fact that we now have five customer experience centers that are stood up at this point. They're helping the stores through this. It still remains one of those things that we feel like there is a lot of upside as we continue to train those associates, as we continue to leverage technology, they're getting better and better at what they do. So, we think we'll continue to make sure we work on the effectiveness. Up to this point, it's really been about kind of rollout and stabilization of the CECs. Now, we're really moving into the phase of optimization of the CECs and really leveraging them to make this a better cost alternative than even the traditional format. As far as the remote appraisals, obviously, as we roll omni everywhere, you will have the option to have an appraisal done online. We at this point have pulled just the appraisal only pieces that are in non-omni markets, but it's one that we continue \u2013 we'll continue to work on and that will be a solution that we'll have in all markets, whether you buy a car from us or not, but it is one that we're continuing to fine tune. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back to Bill Nash for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Well, listen, thank you all for your questions today and your continued support of CarMax. I do have just a couple thoughts before we leave. One, I want to reiterate that similar to other challenging times, it will be difficult in the short term, but we have the expertise. We have the resources, the liquidity, the financial stability, and the partners in place to withstand the current environment and be well positioned to when the economy and the consumer rebound. As I think about the leadership and the associates that we have in the field, this is a crisis tested team and I'd rather not have anybody else than the team that we have today to work through this. So, I'm very encouraged by that.  And I can't say enough about how appreciative I am for everything that our associates are doing to take care of themselves, take care of the customers and the communities. And to our associates, I would just \u2013 I want to tell them that the concern that you demonstrate to each other and our customers, that's core to our values. And I'm incredibly proud to be a part of this team.  I know it's not easy. I know it's a challenging time for all of us. It's a challenging time for the nation. But I also know that we're going to come through this better and stronger than ever. So, again, thank you for your time today. I hope everyone stays healthy. And we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Before I get started, I wanted to comment on the significant social challenges we are facing as a country. At CarMax, we stand united against racial injustice, hatred, and violence. I'm proud that our values have always been focused on doing the right thing and treating everyone with respect regardless of race, ethnicity, or background, but we need to do better as a company and as a country. I want our associates, communities, and shareholders to know that we are committed to doing more. Change must start at the top and that's why I'm personally championing this to ensure we make a positive difference for the future. Now, moving to the highlights for the quarter. As you read in our earnings release this morning, our first quarter performance was significantly impacted by the coronavirus. At the peak in early April, sales were down more than 75%. During this time, 95% of the country was under shelter-in-place orders and approximately half of our stores were closed or under limited operations due to the mandates of public health officials and government agencies. Limited operations means the stores could sell cars, but were limited to appointment only, curbside pickup, home delivery, or some combination of all three. Social distancing guidelines and occupancy restrictions also limited operating capacity at our open stores, including our largest stores, which prior to the virus routinely saw more than 100 customers shopping in a store on any given day. To put this further into perspective, more than 80% of the days in the first quarter were impacted by stores that were closed and/or under limited operations. As of May 31, all of our stores were open, but we still had more than 50% of our stores running with occupancy restrictions and more than 10% with limited operations, as I described earlier. Since we believe our first quarter results are not indicative of future trends, we will not spend a lot of time on commentary that was included within this morning's release. However, we will provide insight into how we navigated the crisis, recent trends, and near-term strategic priorities, we believe create opportunities to further distance ourselves from other used car retailers and thrive in this new environment. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our associates' response to this challenging and rapidly changing environment. They continue to live our core values everyday by taking care of each other, taking care of our customers, and giving back to help our communities. At the start of the pandemic, we had to make an extremely tough decision to furlough more than 15,000 associates due to store closures and lower demand. I'm pleased to say that as of today, we have called back more than 85% of these associates, and we expect to return to normal operating levels in the very near future. We've accomplished a lot this quarter. Our teams were quick to react at the start of the pandemic, implementing robust plans to reduce the risk of exposure and further spread of the virus in our stores, as well as following the mandates of public health officials and government agencies, which were changing daily. We introduced social distancing and sanitation procedures to reduce the risk for our customers and associates. We also launched new initiatives such as contactless curbside pickup, a temporary extension of our 90-day warranty and cash payment assistance to meet the near-term needs of our customers. We quickly shifted our entire wholesale business from in-person to online auctions, and we continue to keep our appraisal lanes open where possible for customers who wanted to or needed to sell their cars. In addition to keeping our stores open and selling cars to customers, we are very pleased with our margin and inventory management for both retail and wholesale in the steepest depreciation environment we've ever experienced. We also exited the quarter in an even stronger liquidity position than we had entered. Since hitting a trough in early April, we have seen our sales progressively improve as stores reopen, occupancy restrictions start to ease, and customers begin to reengage in car buying. Looking at more recent performance, we\u2019re encouraged by the trends we experienced in late May and early June. Web traffic is up year-over-year and reaching new highs, a reflection of the great work our marketing team is doing to capture demand in pay channels and strength in non-brand SEO performance. In addition, leads coming into our Customer Experience Centers, or CECs continue to increase week-over-week. Although we have four stores still on limited operations and more than 50% with occupancy restrictions, for the first two weeks of June, our comp unit sales have been within 10% of last year's sales with many stores comping positively. We've recognized the current environment has accelerated the shift in consumer buying behavior. Customers are seeking safety, personalization, and convenience now more than ever in how they shop for and buy a vehicle. For us, this reaffirms that our strategy is the right path forward, and the current environment creates a unique opportunity for us to accelerate our omni-channel experience and other digitally driven investments. Before the crisis, we were already making significant investments in digital merchandising, online financing, and customer lead management tools, as we rolled out our new omni-channel experience. It's an experience that gives customers the opportunity to buy online, in-store, or a seamless combination of both. We expect to complete our omni-channel rollout in the second quarter and are focusing our efforts on optimizing this customer experience with new enhancements. Our proven business model and ability to act quickly allowed us to meet consumer expectations, while remaining financially strong. This in turn enables us to continue to aggressively invest in our core business and pursue new opportunities for growth, which I'll speak to shortly. Right now, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide a financial update, and then Tom will provide additional detail around customer financing. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our diversified business model, solid balance sheet, and strong cash generation positioned us extremely well to manage through challenging times. This strength also allows us to be opportunistic in the short-term, while maximizing our long-term growth and earnings potential, further distancing ourselves from our competitors. I'll begin with an overview of our operating performance, followed by a review of our financial position. On the GPU front, our teams did a great job managing margins, despite a period of unprecedented marketplace depreciation and operating limitations. Our GPU of $1,937 for the first quarter represented a decrease of $278 per unit versus the prior year. Our wholesale gross profit per unit was solid at $978, down by only $65 per unit versus the prior year quarter. This was despite sharp declines in wholesale values in late March and April.  Our strong GPU management is a testament to the strength of our professional buyers, our proprietary algorithms for buying, selling, and appraising cars, and our experience in managing through challenging times. Our wholesale business experienced a 48% decrease in year-over-year unit sales. Wholesale unit sales were negatively impacted by lower appraisal traffic from stores being closed or having limited operations as well as a decline in our buy rate. During the second half of the quarter, we began to see steady improvement in both areas as the country began to reopen and our auctions transitioned online. Our sell-through rate at our auctions in the quarter was consistent with our historical rate of over 95%. For the quarter, other gross profit decreased by approximately $89 million. This was driven by a $55 million decrease in service department profits and a $38 million decrease in EPP revenues. The decrease in EPP profits is attributable to the decrease in used units sold, slightly offset by a $7 million benefit related to the receipt of profit sharing and favorable cancellation reserve adjustments. We were also pleased to maintain ESP penetration rates above 60% for the quarter. The decrease in service profits reflects overhead deleverage as well as the pay continuity we provided our technicians, despite a reduction in production. Service profits also continued to be adversely affected by the increase in our post-sale warranty period from 30 to 90 days and by a crisis-driven reduction in retail service. As you may recall, the extension of warranty from 30 to 90 days was implemented in May of 2019. As a result of the recent improvement in sales in May and the first part of June, we are ramping production to increase our inventory levels. We, therefore, expect continued service inefficiencies in the second quarter as it takes time to return production to a normalized operating state. During the first quarter, as sales began to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, it was important that we align our operating expenses with the state of the business. At the same time, we took advantage of our financial strength to continue making investments in our omni-channel experience and other digital initiatives that provide us with a competitive advantage. For the quarter, SG&A decreased by more than 20% or $116 million. This is due to a decrease in variable expenses associated with the reduction in sales volume in addition to temporarily furloughing associates, reducing advertising spend and aligning other overhead costs to the business. SG&A for the quarter also benefited from a $40 million gain on settlement of a class action lawsuit and a $17 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense. As the business improves, we expect our SG&A costs will ramp, as associates return from furlough, our advertising spend increases based on increasing demand and we continue to invest in strategic initiatives, which Bill will discuss shortly. Now I'll provide you with an overview of our financial position. We ended the first quarter in a stronger liquidity position than we started. As of May 31, we had approximately $660 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1.08 billion in unused capacity on our revolving credit facility. This compares favorably with the $700 million and $300 million, respectively, we had at the end of March and that we announced on our April 2, fourth quarter call. We were able to increase our liquidity by selling through inventory and quickly aligning costs to the lower volume. We did this while continuing to invest in our omni and digital experiences. From a debt perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, consisting of approximately $370 million outstanding under our revolver credit facility, $800 million of senior notes and term loans and approximately $535 million in financing obligations, largely related to sale leasebacks on select stores. It's important to note we have no near-term maturities as the earliest is in 2023. We ended the quarter modestly below our historical leverage target of 35% to 45% adjusted debt-to-capital, when netting out the approximately $660 million in cash we accumulated. During the first quarter, we opened four new stores that required minimal capital spend to complete. Previously, we mentioned it was our intent to open 13 stores during fiscal year 2021 and a similar number of stores in fiscal year 2022. We continue to pause on any additional spend on store expansion activity in FY 2021, and we'll revisit this decision later in the year. In addition, while we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, our share repurchase program is currently on hold as well. We are extremely proud of our ability to improve our liquidity position during a very challenging quarter, while at the same time, continuing to push forward investments in our omni and digital initiatives. All of this positions us favorably to profitably grow market share as the economy and consumer rebounds. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. The vast majority of customers who purchased a vehicle obtained some sort of financing, it's important that we ensure our broad range of customers have access to lending in all economic conditions. So having cap, along with a diverse group of partner lenders, who recognize the value of CarMax's origination channel allows us to consistently provide high-quality finance offers to our customers. In the first quarter, our lending channel continued to deliver, providing offers to 97% of customers applying for a vehicle. Having a captive finance arm offers numerous contributions to the business model that are difficult to replicate. Within the origination channel, CAF captures considerable finance income, while generating some incremental sales. CAF fully services all of the customers at finances, continuing CarMax's outstanding brand promise throughout the life of the finance contract. We have more than 800 CAF associates and the entire team did a phenomenal job this quarter, quickly mobilizing to work remotely, while responding to the increasing demands of our customers. In mid-March, as the pandemic escalated, we put in place a variety of measures at CAF to help our customers. This included suspending repositions, waiving late fees and providing payment relief under our disaster policies. Our service offering did evolve throughout the quarter, as we focused on supporting our customers, while also protecting our portfolio. Similar to auto \u2013 to our retail and wholesale business, CAF performance was also impacted by the coronavirus. For the quarter, originations decreased substantially due to closed stores and lower sales demand. In addition, CAF penetration, net of three-day payoffs decreased to 36.1% from 41.4% a year ago, due to the shift in the customer credit mix, some temporary underwriting adjustments in certain pockets, focused on preserving our high-quality portfolio, and some testing of loan routing to our third-party partners. Tier 2's penetration increased to 28.5% in Q1 from 20.3% last year, as it benefited from CAF's routing tests and a change in customer credit mix in the quarter. Tier 2's conversion also remained strong. Tier 3 for the first quarter increased to 14.5% from 11.5% a year ago, as it also benefited from the change in customer credit mix. CAF income for the quarter was $51 million, which was predominantly affected by the impact of the increase in this quarter's provision for loan losses to $122 million, which understandably is significantly up from the $38 million in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the ending reserve balance was $437 million versus $147 million a year ago. The significant increase in the loss reserve arose from two factors. First, the required adoption of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard, which is commonly referred to as CECL; and second, an unfavorable adjustment for experience arising from the coronavirus. Upon the adoption of CECL, we recorded a $202 million increase in the allowance for loan losses on the first quarter opening consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustments of $153 million net of tax to retained earnings. As previously discussed, the most significant element of CECL requires us to reserve for expected lifetime net losses, whereas previously we reserved for the following 12 months. In addition, CECL requires the incorporation of economic adjustment factors as a component in the lifetime loss projection. Just to be clear, the initial adjustment for the adoption of CECL ran through retained earnings, it did not impact the Q1 provision for losses. Post adoption, any changes in the loss expectations are applied to the entire remaining life of the portfolio and run through the provision in accordance with CECL. The $122 million provision for loan losses in the first quarter includes an increase of $84 million on our estimate of lifetime losses to receivables on the books as of the end of Q4. This is a nearly 25% increase in our expectations, largely resulting from the coronavirus turmoil and worsening economic factors. The remaining $38 million largely reflects our estimate of lifetime losses on this quarter's originations. As a result, our loss reserve is now 3.32% of ending managed receivables at $13.4 billion. Recall, this includes cash Tier 3 receivables, which represent roughly 10% of the reserve and 1% of the portfolio. With the underwriting adjustments I mentioned earlier, we are currently targeting new loan originations or the higher end of our historic target range for cumulative net loss, which is 2% to 2.5%. As we mentioned last quarter, CAF is not originating Tier 3 loans at this time. We believe our efforts to help customers minimize defaults and maximize the ultimate flexibility of loans are having an impact. At this time, delinquency rates are lower year-over-year. However, this number is somewhat distorted due to payment extensions that have been granted. As one would expect, payment extension spiked in April and have declined significantly in recent weeks as customers have exhibited the ability and willingness to pay. Going forward, we will continue to manage payment extensions with the focus on providing our customers with appropriate relief, while at the same time, protecting our portfolio. We've demonstrated an ability to finance CAF receivables and support the core business, with the execution of a $1.15 billion ABS transaction in April. And we maintained warehouse lines totaling $3.5 billion of capacity of which $1.55 billion was available at the end of May. Finally, we strive to provide our customers with an iconic experience during the car buying process and their multiyear finance experience. Like our own channel investments, we have been making a large investment in our auto finance customer platforms that will provide more opportunities for customers to self-serve and provide flexibility to offer more customized experience. We look forward to rolling out this technology in FY 2022. Our expertise, resources, and strong lending partnerships remain instrumental in helping us successfully manage through this challenging and ever-changing environment. I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams in Atlanta and Richmond for their dedication and hard work. And now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Tom, and Enrique. Our record sales, earnings, and market share gain last year, combined with the changing consumer behavior in favor of omnichannel offerings, validate our strategy as the right path forward. We believe that CarMax is unmatched in the industry as an omnichannel used car retailer and now more than ever, customers want to personalize seamless and multichannel experience that allows them to shop on their terms, whether that is online, in-store, or a combination of both. Over the past several years, we've invested more than $300 million in digital initiatives, technologies, and our associates. These investments focus on modernizing our systems, expanding our digital offerings, and reorganizing ourselves to innovate quickly, while capitalizing on the inherent advantages of being a larger company. I am extremely proud of how these investments have empowered us to quickly adapt to an ever-evolving consumer and operating environment. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've set ourselves up for in the future. The priority of our near-term strategic investments will focus on our customer experience, vehicle acquisition, and our wholesale business. In addition, we will continue to assess opportunities to become a leaner, more agile and more cost effective organization over the long-term, which in turn funds new ways to evolve and grow. Our omni-channel offerings are the next evolution of the exceptional customer experience that CarMax is already known for, providing a truly unique retail experience by personalizing each customer's journey through multiple channels is a significant differentiator for us. With the rollout of omni-channel almost complete, our focus is turning towards improving and evolving this experience. For example, last year, we began testing a post-sale home delivery process, where a customer can buy a car fully online before it is delivered to their home. While most customers prefer to see and drive vehicles before purchase, some want to purchase without taking these steps. It is our goal to quickly scale this capability nationwide by the end of this year were allowed by law for any customer who wants to shop this way. Another experience area that we will continue to focus on is our centralized CECs. While we know they will provide significant long-term benefits, in the near-term they will run with some inefficiencies as they ramp. Opportunities exist to drive effectiveness through improved, associate training and specialization of roles. We also see opportunities to gain efficiencies through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing to get the right customer to the right associate at the right time. When it comes to vehicle acquisition, we are the largest buyer of used vehicles, which provides us with unique avenues to efficiently source cars. In the near term, our investments are going to focus on improving our core buying channels and opening up new buying channels. We will also continue to invest in modernizing our wholesale auction platforms, which will enable us to operate all auctions simultaneously online and in person. Finally, there are a variety of areas we are looking at to become leaner, more agile and more cost-effective over the long-term. These include store and reconditioning efficiencies and adapting our workplace for the future, further separating ourselves as one of the best places to work in America. The rapidly changing consumer behavior is favoring companies with omni-channel offerings. And we believe we have the best omni-channel experience in the used car industry. We provide a personalized, multichannel experience that empowers customers to buy a car on their terms, all while taking steps to keep our customer safe across their car buying journey. It is designed as a world-class in-store experience, a world-class online experience and a seamless combination of the two. No other used car retailer is in the position to deliver this iconic customer experience the way we can, because of our talented associates, our physical footprint, our online experience, our infrastructure and national brands. We are very excited about the future as we continue to leverage all of our capabilities, while also advancing with new innovations. At this time, we will be great -- be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. I hope every one is well and healthy down there. Bill, I have a question just regarding your performance. I mean, we obviously saw a very nice sequential improvement since kind of late March, early April. But the fact is you are still posting negative comps, call it 10% or just under 10%. I think we've seen both e-commerce competitors and franchise competitors shift to positive comps in their used business. So I guess, I'm wondering are there any structural reasons why CarMax would be underperforming others by that magnitude, especially given your outperformance call it in the fourth quarter? Bill Nash : Yes. Good morning, Scot. So I think, first of all, it's a little difficult to do comparisons at this point. You have to look at growth rates going into it. You have to look at growth rates that they're currently at. I think you have to look at geographic differences. I also think you have to take into consideration different responses to the mandates, because I can tell you even though we are following mandates in every single market, we know that there are others that were not following mandates. But I think the biggest factor, I think the structural factor that I think it's important to remind everyone, and I talked about this in my opening remarks about the limited operations and the occupancy restrictions. Keep in mind, we sell on average more than 300 cars a month. We have locations that sell upwards of 1,000 cars a month. And when you start talking about limited operations or occupancy restrictions, let me bring it to life for you. We had occupancy restrictions in a bunch of markets where all you could have were 10 customers in your store at a time, that's 10 total customers. So, it doesn't matter if they're for appraisals, if they're for buying, or they're there for retail, you can only have 10. So I think that alone, the occupancy restriction and the limited operations probably hurt us a little bit more just because of the sheer volume. Because again, if you're a dealer that sells 60 to 100 cars, even limiting it to 10 customers at a time is not as impactful on them as it would be for someone like us. Scot Ciccarelli : So with that in mind, is there any way to potentially estimate the impact that some of these occupancy restrictions have had on your business within the last couple of weeks? Bill Nash : Yes. It's hard to pinpoint down to specifics. In my opening remarks, when we had -- at the peak, we had half of them that we either closed or limited operations. At that point, the bulk of them were closed. So we had about 70 stores that were closed, 35 were under limited operations, and then the remaining 100-plus had occupancy restrictions. And over time, what we saw is that shifted from store close to limited operations and eventually from limited operations to occupancy restrictions. Now the great news is; the occupancy restrictions although currently, we still have half of our stores that have occupancy requirements, they're starting to ease. So instead of having only 10 customers or 20% occupancy or 30% occupancy, you're starting to migrate more to 50% occupancy, which makes a big difference. We still have four stores that are running limited operations right now, but we hope to get them back up to full operations based off the mandates in the near future. Now, keep in mind with the rise of the virus spiking in some markets, at any given point in time, we may have to close a store here and there because of a positive test result in the store. And our normal protocol, we close, we do a big deep clean and then we reopen. So, if I look back in Q1, it probably -- it's right around 73% of the days we ran with limited operations, about 70% -- a little above 70% of the days we ran with closed -- totally closed operations. And when you look at them combined, about 62-ish percent of the days out of the quarter had both things going on, closed and limited operations. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to follow-up on that last point. So Bill, you did discuss some stores returning to positive in the recent weeks. So, if you're running down 10% overall quarter-to-date, it does imply a pretty big gap still across the store base. So, I just want to confirm, is that purely the occupancy restrictions, or are there other regional differences and any other trends that maybe you can speak to across the store base. And then, if you can, anyway to give us a sense on how positive or how much stores are positive versus not, that would be helpful. Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, Seth. So, regionally, if you look at it throughout the quarter, obviously, there were certain markets that were a lot more restrictive for a lot longer time period. And some of the West Coast stores come to mind. So right now, I think the occupancy restrictions and the limited operations are the big driver of the difference between -- keep in mind, there's lots of different mandates out there by local level. And so, the more restrictive the mandates are, the more it's going to have an impact on our business. So that's really what's driving, I think, the different performance as well as some of these markets have been open for three, four weeks now, other markets are just starting to kind of reopen. So I think that's the big driver between the differences. But, again, we're pleased both with how occupancy restrictions are starting to ease, and we're pleased with the fact that we do have a bunch of our stores already comping over significantly higher sales last year. Seth Sigman : Okay. Any way to quantify what significant means, how much over the last year? Bill Nash : Well, it's not quite a majority of the stores at this point, but we do many stores that are comping. Seth Sigman : Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Sharon. Sharon Zackfia : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk about some of the shifts you alluded to in consumer behavior, and put some more numbers around that. Obviously, you've been rolling out omni-channel and you rolled out curbside pick up pretty aggressively earlier in the quarter. Look, what kind of opt-in rate did you get on either delivery or curbside pickup? Any indication on how that's also trending as markets reopen, would be, I think, useful. Bill Nash : Yes. Sure, Sharon. So, first of all, the way I think about our omni-channel experience, I don't necessarily measure it, kind of through alternative delivery, although I'll speak to that to answer your question. The way I think about the omni-channel experience is, how many of our customers are engaging with us online with our CECs. And prior to the virus hitting, it was roughly about 50% of our sales were coming through engagement with our CECs. Fast forward to now, that number is north of 60%. And I think that's reflective of customers wanting to do more things online. If you look at kind of alternative delivery, so for us, it's about home delivery. And curbside, at the peak, when most stores were closed and running under limited operations. And the markets that offer those services, combined, you're looking close to about 15% penetration. The interesting thing though is now markets are starting to open. We still see heavy engagement online, doing things ahead of time, but customers are still opting to go to the store. So the number has actually settled down now between those two, right around 10%, a little bit under 10%. Sharon Zackfia : Thanks for that. And if I could follow-up with an additional question, just on the GPU pressure you saw this quarter, I mean, obviously, you managed inventory very well. Are you expecting any kind of incremental GPU pressure in the second quarter, or do you feel like, you've kind of managed through that and have a lower cost inventory at this point? Bill Nash : Yes. No, I think we are in great shape. Again, I said this on my opening remarks that the team did a phenomenal job. And just to put it in perspective, if you go back to 2008 and 2009 in the Great Recession, over the worst depreciation cycle. So over about a year's time, we saw $3,500 in depreciation. In this period, over about a five-week period, we saw about $2,500 of depreciation. We've never seen the magnitude of depreciation like we saw this time. The team did a phenomenal job rightsizing our inventory, and we certainly did not go into fire cell mode by any stretch of the imagination. But we did do strategic markdowns on certain pieces of inventory to make sure that we got it into the right level. So I feel really great about our position. I feel really great about our margins going forward. And assuming that the economy, obviously, there's lots of uncertainty with the economy right now, but assuming that we continue on this cycle, I think we \u2013 the GPU headwinds are beyond us. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just around restraints on sales that you haven't mentioned so far in the Q&A. First is on inventory and second is on CAF underwriting. Any sense of how you can quantify how much of those held back your sales in recent weeks? Bill Nash : Yes. I'll talk about the inventory. So obviously, when the virus hit, our immediate focus in \u2013 when the virus hit, our immediate kind of crisis focus was really about, okay, the health and safety and financial wellbeing of our associates, the health and safety of our customers, but then also the financial security of the organization. And part of that financial security was rightsizing the inventory. And we always make sure we have the inventory that's appropriate for sales. So this was no different. When we saw the demand go down, we absolutely got into the mode of, okay, let's get our inventory right sized. Now, the great news is, the sales have come back better than what we expected over a quicker time period. And we've got our production facilities all back up and operational, but it is a bit of a headwind right now. If you look at the sales demand and our inventory is lighter than where we want to, but truthful I'd rather be on this side of the equation than the other side of the equation. So again, I think the team did a great job. And we'll work over the next few weeks to get the inventory right sized. We've already started to fill back up our pipeline. Our sale of inventory is less down \u2013 I mean, it's more down year-over-year than our total inventory. So now it's just a matter of getting it produced, which our teams do a phenomenal job on. And then I'll let Tom talk a little bit about CAF. Tom Reedy : Yes, hey, Seth, because there's so many moving parts, it's really hesitate to try and tease out precise numbers on drivers of sales. But what we saw during the quarter was not just a shift in mix of overall credit for customers, but even a shift in the mix within Tier 1. And that means a greater proportion. When you look at how CAF approves, we have segments that we buy and a greater portion of the Tier 1 mix was at the lower most \u2013 higher \u2013 higher loss segments. So in order to preserve our portfolio and financeability, as we target on a go-forward basis, we made some, I would call it, fine-tuning by carving out, at least for the time being, some of those highest loss segments. And what does that mean? That means that those loans go down to Tier 2 and they see them first rather than us. We know that, overall, there is some pressure on conversion when you go to Tier 2, because the offers aren't quite as nice as what they see at CAF. But for the most part, our Tier 2 lenders are delighted to see those and accommodate them, because it's the high end of what they typically buy. So we did see them taking up for the most part. I think there was some pressure, maybe one or two points on sales based on the adjustments we made. But as we see credit mix go back to normal and that means both the increase in the overall FICO score and mix within Tier 1, that pressure will diminish because a lower percentage of the portfolio is -- falls into those categories and is getting pushed down to Tier 2. Seth Basham : Thank you. Bill Nash : Hey Seth, the other thing I'll mention that you did not mention as far as the headwind is, I would also consider the CECs to be a bit of a headwind this quarter as well. Because of that big jump up that we saw from folks engaging online, we expected to get there. We had no idea we're going to get there over about a four-week period. So, we had to ramp up the CECs, which in the near-term, is a bit of a headwind. Our service levels were not at where we want them to be. But again, we're fixing that right now and that will continue to improve as well. Seth Basham : Thank you. And just as a follow-up, Tom, as it relates to your loan loss provision, your current balance, which is 3.3% of loans, that's up in the range that we saw at the peak of the Great Recession. And for loans originated in the quarter, 3.8% is well above it, understanding that there's some shift in the credit profile of what you originated this quarter. But how do we think about where that loan loss rate and provision is likely to go going forward? Tom Reedy : Well, it is -- the way things work, we may take our best information and make an estimate on where we expect the portfolio to end up. So, for existing loans, that 3.32% is our expectation based on everything we know today. We would not expect that to evolve unless we were to learn new information or new things to evolve in the economy. As far as new originations, as I said, we've made some adjustments to our origination strategy and we expect that those should evolve in kind of the higher end of our target range of 2% to 2.5%. That's what we're striving to do and that, I think, ensures a financeable portfolio and keep things going. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Bill Nash : Good morning. Rajat Gupta : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. I just had one clarification from a prior question and then one follow-up. So, on clarification, the 10% to 15% penetration level you talked about for omni earlier, is that -- does that mean that 10% to 15% of sales -- unit sales right now is completely through the alternative delivery channels or I just want to make sure like I'm understanding that definition correctly? Bill Nash : Yes. So, the 10% to -- so at the peak of the virus, when we had the most stores closed or in limited operations, we saw in the markets, the eligible markets that have the home delivery and the curbside, we saw peak -- combined peak close to 15%. If you looked at it as a percent of total sales across the whole organization, it was around 10%, and it settled in -- it was a little bit above 10%, but it's now settled back in to a little -- around 10%, a little bit under 10%. Rajat Gupta : Got it. So, that will mean like around like 15,000 units or so in last quarter were through the alternative channel? Is that the bulk for us roughly? Bill Nash : Roughly. Yes, maybe a little bit higher. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just on the cost side of the equation, just through the crisis process and the furloughs and the headcount reductions, do we -- should we expect to see any permanent reductions in SG&A when you're back to more normalized levels of sales? And relatedly, during the 2008, 2009 crisis, you did see significant improvement in efficiencies related to reconditioning. I mean, there was a structural shift in your retail GPU. Do we -- should we expect something similar or maybe of a lower magnitude this time around as well? Just want to clarify on those two points. Thanks. Bill Nash : Yeah. I'll talk about the reconditioning side, and then I'll let Enrique talk about the SG&A. So on the reconditioning side, as I said earlier, we're going to continue to look for ways to take cost out. The reconditioning well be one. If you remember back in 2008, we had significant improvements there. What I would say is I think they're going to be incremental improvements in the reconditioning. So I wouldn't say that you're going to see -- back then, it was north of $250 per unit. There is no big, okay, go do this, and it's going to be $250. There's going to be a lot of incremental things. We're going to be rolling out our new version of flow into all the stores, we pick up efficiencies there, as well as we'll continue look for procurement efficiencies, both in the reconditioning side, but in the store side as well. And I'll let Enrique talk about the SG&A. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. From an SG&A perspective, within the quarter, we focus our actions aggressively on better aligning what we've traditionally considered as fixed costs really to match the lower demand. So items like staffing through our furloughs, advertising reduction, reduction in contractors, store-based project, home office-based projects really were all acted on aggressively within the quarter. But as sales rebound, we do expect these costs to increase, as I spoke to earlier, but we're always looking at ways to get more efficient. It's kind of too early to tell whether or not there's some systematic opportunities. What I will tell you, though, is that we will continue to invest in our business as well. So we have a strong balance sheet. We have a strong financial position and it allows us to continue to invest in our growth as well. Bill Nash : Yeah. I think the other thing to add to that. If you looked at what we were thinking about -- before the coronavirus, we're going to be coming into this year, we were going to continue to make investments. In the past couple of years, we've talked about needing comps in the range of 5% to 8% in order to lever. If you looked at what we were looking at coming into this year, if all we've been focused on with omni, the omni experience, we would have levered better than that. Now we have made the decision to hit some new strategic initiatives, some of which we continue to hit into this quarter, some of them we put on hold. But that gives you a little bit of color. We still -- this year had been a normal year. We would have still been in the 5% to 8% range, but it's just so hard to know at this point, as sales come back, we'll continue to adapt. Rajat Gupta : Got it, great. Thanks for the color and good luck. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Armintas Sinkevicius : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could quantify the growth in the web traffic and the growth in the lead to the customer experience center that you highlighted in the press release? Bill Nash : Yeah. So that growth, I was talking about was the first two weeks of June, both leads and traffic were double digit. Armintas Sinkevicius : Both leads and traffic, okay. And what was it for the quarter? Bill Nash : For the quarter, web traffic was down, it was about 11% and leads weren't far off from that. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. And then just a quick one here. As we think about less new vehicle inventory coming to market, there being a pressure on new vehicle inventory. Maybe you could talk about the age of your portfolio and how well positioned or not, you are to be able to sell nearly new vehicles to the market that may be demanding them? Bill Nash : Yes. So, as far as the source goes, we don't feel like we had a problem on finding the vehicles. We're in production mode right now, which is really building the inventory back up, but the concern isn't about being able to find the vehicles. We'll be able to source those. I will tell you, during the quarter, pretty much the wholesale market external market froze because a lot of the sales were closed, dramatically low vehicles being offered for sale. But at that time, we weren't out really buying anyway. So it didn't really matter. And it's gone to the point now where, if you look at the volume that you're seeing in the sales and you look at the sales rate that you're seeing in the external sales, they really have come back. They're very near getting back to pre-virus levels. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. But are you seeing you selling younger cars or older cars? Where are you seeing the most demand? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, during the quarter, we had a little bit of a shift mix to -- from zero to two-year-old car shifted to five plus. So that's what we saw during the quarter. We also saw \u2013 if you look at our average selling price for the quarter, it was up a little bit, but that's primarily due to the fact that we had a shift mix into large SUV gas closures, which are more expensive year-over-year. We were several percentage points up on that. And because a lot of the inventory that was sold in March and April was acquired back in the appreciating market time of the pre-virus. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. Appreciate it. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill Nash : Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel : So Bill, on the last quarter conference call and I was right in the beginning of the COVID crisis. I asked you, we discussed this kind of the nature of what was then very quickly diminish in demand. So here, you're saying today, it's very encouraging that we're seeing this rather significant sales pickup late into the quarter into the current quarter. So you've gotten much better with data, watching your customers. I mean, as we're all trying to figure out kind of what we're rebounding to, we have got this with CarMax within retail in general, how would you characterize this demand right now? Is there pent-up from the weaker sales maybe several weeks ago, or do you see underlying \u2013 real underlying demand taking hold that's likely to sustain itself? Bill Nash : Yes. Brian, it's hard to know for sure. I mean, I think there's absolutely some pent-up demand because people were staying at home for several weeks. So I think there's some of that. I think the CARES Act has given some folks money. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why you see the increase in Tier 3. I think that it's a little bit like tax refund money. When folks have it, they tend to go out. And the biggest population that we see that driving are the lower FICO-type customers. As far as the sustainability, it's hard to tell. I mean, right now, it's such an uncertain environment out there. I mean, we've got high unemployment. You've got these spikes in the coronavirus cases. You got the social challenges going on. So I think we're well positioned and having come through this, I think we're more agile and resilient than even before. So I think we're prepared for wherever it may go, but I think it's too early to say, hey, this is going to be \u2013 where this is going to go? And is this going to be sustained? I think it's going to depend on a lot of macro factors, but what I can tell you is that we'll be ready to pivot any way we need to. Brian Nagel : That's really helpful. And then my follow-up question and I think it's a bit of a follow-up to some of the prior questions. Just with regard to inventory. And I know there's a lot of moving parts out there right now. But as we think about with that spread, if you will, between new and used car pricing, give what you're seeing right now. How is that shaping up in this environment? As you look forward, I mean, what I'm saying, are you seeing -- for whatever -- because of the dynamics or shifting dynamics, actually better inventory acquisition opportunities that could basically help to bolster sales down the road? Bill Nash : Yes. So, during the quarter, it really was a kind of a non-story as far as the gap widening or collapsing. And I think as we look forward, there's a lot of factors that you have to kind of weigh in. What's going to happen with new cars as far as the manufacture and how much production they're going to actually be able to do? They're struggling to get opened back up again and get new cars out there. So, I think that will be something that weighs into it. I think there's probably a lot of wholesale inventory that needs to be released through the sales that kind of got backed up a little bit. So I would expect to see additional wholesale inventory being offered. So, I think it just depends. It depends on the new car and how that continues to progress as well as when the timing of some of this wholesale inventory really starts to come out. I mean, I talked about the depreciation during the quarter, but what\u2019s remarkably, which is as remarkable as the decline was how quick it's come back. And so, I think, the wholesale market is pretty self regulating. And at some point, if it gets too high, it will just slow down sales. And it corrects itself. But I think supply -- we will be fine on the supply side. But as far as the gap between new cars really going to depend on, I think, production of the manufacturers. Brian Nagel : Okay. Well, thanks a lot. Appreciate all the color. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the wholesale business, that pivot to all online wholesale auction sales happen really fast, that's tremendous execution on behalf of that team. I would like to understand the economics of that digital-only model versus your traditional format? Are you experiencing any differences in like the proceeds per unit, or what you see as your cost per unit? And do you see this as a permanent change? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Craig. And you're right. It was awesome. The team did a phenomenal job. We've talked about in the past, the fact that we've been testing some simulcast technology. And really within a matter of about two weeks, got all of the sales converted over to the virtual platform is truly remarkable. And the team did a phenomenal job. As far as the economics, it's a little too early to talk about that. But what I will tell you is, during that time period, we didn't see any degradation of dealer attendance. So, we already had a very high dealer-to-car ratio. And obviously, the more dealers you have, the more your vehicles will bring as far as price goes. So, I think that our physical presence in having online auctions, but also complementaring it -- I'm sorry, having the physical presence and having running these auctions, and then also complementing it with the online, is great, because I think it will continue to open up the sales to even more dealers. And when you have more dealers, theoretically, you should be able to get more value for your cars. And if you can get more value for your car, then you -- for us, you want to put as much on it for the consumer as we can, so we can buy as many units as possible. So, I think it's a little early, but I would expect that having the online will make it available to more dealers. Craig Kennison : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just, first off, wanted to start on the advertising front. You know, I was curious to see, Bill if you could give any color about where you see kind of full year and even next quarter kind of ad spend per vehicle going, just in light of the fact that the sales is recovering? And then I had a follow-up on multichannel. Bill Nash : Yes. So you know, if the virus hadn't been here, I think we had already talked about, you know, last year we stepped up a little bit on a per unit basis when it came to advertising. This year we were planning on \u2013 if you look at on a per unit basis is actually we look it. We would spend a little bit more and really a lot of that was also to support the omnichannel rollout. Obviously, we pulled back on all different pieces of advertising during the quarter, but we've been ramping it back up again. And so \u2013 I would expect the rest of the year to get more on par, assuming that business continues like this, I would expect to get more on par what we would have been expecting had the virus not hit us. Michael Montani : Okay. Great. And then just on the multichannel front. You know, in the release, you mentioned that a lot of that rollout was now kind of completed. And so I just wanted to drill into that to understand better \u2013 like how many of the stores currently are offering ship-to-home or home delivery capabilities? And then secondly, as it relates to the CECs, at what point in time could we anticipate that those would \u2013 start to generate kind of net favorability and efficiency gains as they gain scale? Bill Nash : Okay. So on the omnichannel experience, at the end of the quarter, we were roughly, let's say, it was available. Omnichannel experience was roughly available in about 65% of the markets. We're now in the 70-ish, mid-70-ish. We will be done with rolling omnichannel out next quarter. Now as far as home delivery goes, when we're all said \u2013 when we get it rolled out \u2013 omnichannel rolled out everywhere, home delivery will probably right off the bat. At that point, only be available to about 85% of the markets just because there's some small one-off markets and some different logistics that we'll have to work through. As far as the CEC efficiencies coming into this year, we didn't expect the CEC efficiency \u2013 we didn't expect the CECs to really become efficient because we knew we are going to continue to ramp of omni and as we are ramping up, but we knew they are going to be inefficient. So I would expect the efficiencies really \u2013 to really take hold in next fiscal year. But I tell you, I'm really pleased with some of the progress we've already made on the conversion. If you look at the conversion of the CECs versus the conversion of our old process, we continue to see improvements there. And so we're excited about it. We think it's going to give us a lot of great benefits as we look forward. Michael Montani : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session as we have reached 10 A.M. Those remaining in queue can reach out to Investor Relations to have their questions answered. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. Thank you, Carol. Yes. So look, I would just say, look we've never experienced such a rapidly changing environment in all aspects of our business, whether it's retail, it's wholesale, or CAF. In my opening remarks, I talked about all the different accomplishments. And I'd tell you, it's really \u2013 it's because of the strength of our culture, the unique business model and our financial structure that really has enabled us to navigate all this. We feel really good about our investments and our path forward and we believe our omni-channel experience is fundamentally different than any other used car retailer, because of that fact it is designed in the world-class in-store or world-class online, but equally important, it's a world-class combination of the two. I want to thank all of you for your questions today. Thank you for your support. And as always, I have to thank our associates for their continued dedication to living our values each and every day. You are the success of CarMax. So, thank you for what you do and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered a record quarter with sales up 3.3% to $5.37 billion, net earnings up 27% to $297 million, and EPS up 27.9% to $1.79. This performance was the result of strength across all aspects of our business : retail, wholesale, and CAF. We are proud to be the nation's largest and most profitable retailer of used car. I'm also proud to say that this quarter we completed the rollout of our omni-channel offerings. This has been years in the making and has required a remarkable level of focus and change across our entire organization. During this time, we have evolved nearly every aspect of our business. From how we support and interact with our customers to how we structure our staffing to how we buy, sell and deliver cars. Our omni-channel experience is built to provide a personalized multichannel experience that empowers customers to buy a car on their terms. It is designed as a world-class in-store experience, a world-class online experience, and a seamless integration of the 2 giving us the largest addressable market within the used car industry. No other used car retailer is in the position to deliver this iconic customer experience the way we can. Now turning to our results. For the second quarter, we achieved a 3.9% increase in total used units sold and the used unit comp growth of 1.2%. In June, we experienced a high-single-digit negative used unit comp which was more than offset by positive comps in both July and August. The improvement in sales was the result of a variety of factors, including solid execution in operations, finance, and marketing in addition to a strengthening used car sales environment. In the quarter, we saw solid growth in web traffic, averaging approximately 29 million visits per month to carmax.com. During the second quarter, our saleable inventory was below our targeted level as we saw a rapid increase in demand from the first quarter. For the past three months, our teams have done a phenomenal job buying and producing vehicles at record levels, increasing salable inventory by more than 50% in the quarter. Today, I'm pleased to report that we've successfully ramped inventory to targeted levels, providing customers with more than 55,000 vehicles nationwide, the largest of any used car retailer. We offer a broad selection of inventory with a focus on zero to 10-year-old vehicles. This quarter, we saw 5 to 10-year-old vehicles increased to 27% compared with 22% last year as a percentage of our sales mix, reflecting customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. Gross profit per used unit for the quarter was $2,214, up $31 per unit from a year ago. For wholesale, performance was supported by strong appreciation in the market and excellent execution by our teams. Volume was up 5.1%, driven by one more auction date in the quarter and a record buy rate. We also achieved record gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,086 in the quarter, the result of strong appreciation and operational execution. By the end of the quarter, we saw depreciation return to the marketplace. As a reminder, all auctions continue to run virtually throughout the quarter. As our results show, we have achieved a substantial recovery in our business. Over the past several months, our talented workforce has demonstrated incredible agility and ability to drive change in one of the most challenging environments that we've ever faced. We are proud to say that by the end of July, our team was back together again and we no longer had associates on furlough. We are now actively hiring across the country as we continue to grow our core business, enhance our omni-channel offerings, and pursue new opportunities. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on our second quarter financial performance, and Tom who will provide additional detail around customer financing. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, other gross profit increased $6.8 million or 5.8%. EPP profits grew by $6.1 million or 5.4%, largely due to the increase in used units sold. In the quarter, we also recognized $8.2 million in extended service plan profit sharing revenues compared with $6.5 million recognized a year ago. In the second quarter, we maintained our ESP penetration above 60% compared with the prior year quarter. Service profits increased $4.5 million or 31%, which benefited primarily from the improved sales growth and the employee retention tax credit from the CARES Act. The increase in EPP and service profits were partially offset by a $5 million increase in net third-party finance fees attributable to a shift in our sales mix by finance channel. On the SG&A front, expenses increased 2% to approximately $9 million to $490 million. SG&A per used unit was $2,256, a year-over-year leverage of $44 per unit on the quarter. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, SG&A leverage was $97 a unit. Notable SG&A expense drivers for the second quarter were : the opening of 14 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year, which represents a 7% growth in our store base; a $12 million or $53 per unit increase in share-based compensation expense; a 7.7% increase in advertising expense and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support our core and omni-channel strategic initiatives. Our ability to leverage SG&A in the quarter was supported by the decisive actions we took at the start of the pandemic to appropriately manage costs in a challenging environment. We furloughed associates and froze hiring for a period of time, rightsized certain functions, aligned other overhead costs to the business, and paused our store expansion strategy thereby reducing preopening costs in the quarter. We also experienced year-over-year favorability in the quarter due to lower self-insured loss and litigation-related expenses. We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. Examples of these areas include improving the efficiencies of our customer experience centers or CECs, strategic sourcing, and inventory production. At the same time, we are very bullish about our future given our unique customer offering. We recognize that we have an opportunity to capitalize on our current position and grow market share. Accordingly, we remain in a period of investment as we continue to evolve our omni experience in the areas of vehicle and customer acquisition. We also planned in the back half of this year to increase our year-over-year spend in marketing which Bill will address shortly. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain focused on growing the business while managing with the appropriate amount of caution given the uncertainty that remains in the macro environment. Two key updates. First, we are ready to resume store growth and are currently planning for 8 to 10 new stores in FY '22. And second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we fully paid down the outstanding balance on our revolver. Given the turnaround in our business, the strength of the credit markets and our solid balance sheet, we are confident that we have the appropriate liquidity and access to capital. Finally, we ended the quarter modestly below our historical leverage target of 35% to 45% adjusted debt-to-capital when netting out cash. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reedy : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Similar to our retail and wholesale business, CarMax Auto Finance and our partner lenders delivered with strong conversion in all credit tiers, and solid growth in cap income independent of the favorable loss experience. As we previously discussed, CAF made some temporary underwriting adjustments early in the pandemic, with the goal of ensuring financeable Tier 1 portfolio. While we remain cautious in our outlook, we are pleased with the trends we have experienced to date. Payment extensions are down significantly, delinquencies are trending favorably, and our July ABS transaction was well received. Consequently, in the back half of the quarter, we began originating our normal spectrum of Tier 1 business. CAF also curtailed its in-house Tier 3 lending at the start of the pandemic and did not originate any loans through this channel in the second quarter. Based on the trends I just mentioned, we have reengaged in the Tier 3 space in recent weeks. Now I'll turn to performance in the quarter. Net of 3-day payoffs, they were significantly lower year-over-year. Cash penetration was 42.6% compared with 42.2% a year ago. Tier 2 accounted for 22.3% of used unit sales compared with 19.7% last year. And Tier 3 was up to 11.1% compared with 9.6% a year ago. Year-over-year, cash net loans originated grew by 1% to $1.8 billion as the increases in used cars sold and penetration rate were somewhat offset by a lower average amount finance. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.2%, down from 8.6% a year ago and 8.4% in the first quarter. The lower rate reflects our focus on a higher-quality portfolio for much of the quarter. Portfolio interest margin as a percent of average managed receivables increased to 6% versus 5.7% in Q2 last year. Combined with our growth in receivables, this drove an increase in total interest margin of 7.4%, independent of any favorability in the provision for loan losses. Total CAF income for the quarter was up 29% to $147.2 million. This improvement primarily reflected a reduced loan loss provision, plus the increase in both interest margin and average managed receivables. The provision for loan losses was $26 million in Q2, which results in an ending reserve balance of $433 million. That's 3.2% of average managed receivables, which is moderately lower than at the end of Q1. While its loss experienced in June, July and August was significantly favorable to the expectations we set at the end of Q1. The loss reserve continues to reflect the unpredictability of the current environment in the highly uncertain consumer situation. Our results in Q2 illustrate the importance of having a diverse group of lenders that can continually deliver high-quality finance offers to our broad range of customers in all economic environments. In addition, having a fully functioning captive finance such as CAF offers numerous contributions to the business model that are difficult to replicate. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Tom, Enrique. As I mentioned earlier, we have completed the rollout of our omni-channel offering. The powerful integration of our online and in person experiences give us the largest addressable market within the used car industry. Along with the ability to buy online, customers are also seeking experienced guidance along the way. We are uniquely capable of providing this help whenever and wherever the customers want with our centralized CECs, experienced floor sales consultants and personalized e-commerce capabilities. Buying a used car is still a highly considered and complex purchase. Customers don't want to be forced to interact 100% in-store or 100% online. Our competitive advantage is giving customers the option to seamlessly do as much or as little online and in-person as they want. While omni is now rolled out nationwide, it is still early in its evolution, and we will continue to make enhancements to meet and exceed our customers' current and future needs. One area of focus is our CECs. And although a relatively new capability for us and still maturing, they are quickly becoming more effective than our previous model. An example of how we are optimizing performance is by leveraging our data advantage and machine learning to ensure we get the right work to the right associate at the right time. We capture our customers' online interactions, combine them with the information in our customers' data mark, and provide a truly personalized experience that is much more effective in meeting the customer needs and improving our conversion rates. We believe that we have an unmatched opportunity to create a superior customer experience by leveraging our data and technology advantages, both online and in-store. Digital merchandising is another area of continuous improvement. By the end of this year, we will have rolled out approximately 95% of our photo studios, which provide a more immersive experience with high-quality photos, 360-degree interior and exterior views, feature scoring hotspots and reconditioning with new part call outs. We also continue to upgrade content on our website to help customers fully research a vehicle without ever having to leave carmax.com. All this provides our customers more confidence as they progress online. The other omni area of focus that I will highlight is our customer hub, which provides customers a means to track the progress they have made, both online and in-person. It is here that customers can manage certain aspects of their car-buying journey. They can book mark and save vehicles they've selected online. They can submit financing pre-approval and compare their financing options. They can also get an estimate or an actual offer for their trade-in. And finally, they can complete the checkout process in the hub for the car they selected online or in-store and choose if they want a home delivery or a curbside pickup. Our omni-channel experience has been well received. Approximately 70% of our customers interacted with our CECs this quarter. Additionally, approximately 50% of our customers progressed their sale remotely, up from about 42% pre-COVID. Most of these customers still chose to come to the store to complete their transaction, and approximately 30% of our customers still opted for an in-store experience only. Again, the advantage of our business model is that customers have the choice as to how they progress their experience. This is what gives us the largest addressable market. We are focused on driving customer engagement strategies to ensure we continue to remain top of mind and the first choice for car buyers and sellers. We launched a national marketing campaign last year, which has reinforced the strength of our brand and established a solid platform for future campaigns. We've now introduced our omni-channel offering nationwide. Accordingly, as we go forward, our messaging will focus on clearly differentiating our brand from digital-only and traditional dealer brands by demonstrating the benefits of our omni-channel offering. Additionally, we will be increasing our year-over-year marketing spend in the back half of the year to expand our teams and investments in areas such as SEO, SEM, messaging, content and social. Our goal is to drive high ROI customers to our digital properties, while empowering us to create multichannel personalized campaigns. We have a unique retail customer experience that we are continuing to evolve to exceed our customers' expectations. At the same time, we are identifying and investing in new initiatives that we believe will also be solid contributors to our earnings growth. All of this leads to a very exciting future, but none of this would be possible without our great associates. I want to recognize all of them and the high-performance culture they maintain here at CarMax, a culture that values all individuals and perspectives. Over the past several years, we have taken on the largest transformation in our company history, evolving nearly every aspect of our business. We also accomplished all these great results in one of the most challenging environments we've ever faced. And through it all, our associates have continued to live our values every day by putting people first and taking care of each other. I am very proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. At this time, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Great execution in this environment, it's really impressive stuff. Bill, there's one statement in the press release that is kind of intriguing. You're saying inventory was a headwind to sales in the quarter. I'm just curious if you kind of expand upon that, if you think that will be relieved here in near term, it sounds like in September, it was to some degree, but also as all these omni-channel efforts bear fruit and bring customers in, how do you think about sort of the change in inventory management as your addressable market grows dramatically, and do you need to inventory more or think about inventory in a different way than you have historically? Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you, John. Well, first of all, I think omni or not omni, it won't change how we manage our inventory. I think it's one of the strengths of the Company that we've fine-tuned over the last 27 years, and we continue. And I can't say enough about the team. I mean, bumping up our inventory during the quarter about 50% is truly tremendous. And I think in any normal environment, having that amount of inventory shortage would be a significant headwind to sales. Now having said that, we're far from a normal environment, and I think it's hard to quantify the exact degree of how much it impacted our sales other than it absolutely had an impact to sales. But in the COVID environment, there are a lot of other competitors that were light on inventory. You had some stimulus money out there, so it's hard to know kind of what the offsets were to that headwind. But again, I'd just go back to saying that the team has done a remarkable job both buying and producing to get us into the spot where we are today. We ended the quarter. We were still light on inventory when we ended the quarter. But as of today, we feel really good about our total inventory position. John Murphy : Okay. And just one follow-up real quick. I mean, on -- in the future as omni-channel expands, I mean, would you think you need to bump up your inventories, you have to go with that or would you just be turning and be much more efficient on inventory? Just trying to gauge inventory would go up 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% as these efforts really take off and if there would need to be something else in the mix or are you just much more efficient on inventory trend? Bill Nash : Yes. I mean, we went down the omni path, because we expect this. This is a better customer experience, and we expect to sell more cars. And if we're selling more cars that will also be reflected in our inventory, we'll have more inventory. So -- and I think that's the way we've managed the business for the last 27 years. I don't see that deviating, so So as we have more sales, we'll have more inventory. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : I guess a question on customer awareness of omni-channel. So, I'm glad to hear you're going to be bulking up the marketing around that, and that can happen in the fiscal year. But do you have any measures as to what kind of broader customer awareness is nationally versus maybe Atlanta where you started? And then a corollary question that adds as the tail. Given this is a long purchase cycle, in those early markets, do you continue to see that tail of omni-channel relative to kind of the more recent markets where you've rolled it out, if that makes sense? Bill Nash : Yes. So Sharon, I think, first of all, for the broader awareness. I mean, I think now is the time to really let customers know that, hey, everything that's in great about CarMax is still there, but we have a lot of new capabilities. So we really haven't unleashed that up to this point. I mean we've had some marketing campaigns. I can't give any specific market awareness about omni-channel, but it is one of the reasons why we're going to step up advertising as we go forward. As far as how we feel -- if I look at our older markets, say, the Atlanta market, we feel great. We feel great about the gains that we're seeing in the markets. We also feel great about the awareness because, obviously, it's been around a little bit longer. But I do think the advertising message going forward is going to be -- it's going to be different, and we'll make sure that people understand the difference between us and traditional dealers and online competitors. Sharon Zackfia : Bill, just a follow-up. How quickly are we going to see the new marketing? Bill Nash : You will see it later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Celeste, best wishes to you. Thanks for all your support. Question on the wholesale business. Wholesale GPU was up $174. How much of that is a byproduct of higher prices versus a lower cost to process the vehicle? And then to what extent has the pivot to digital auctions increase the number of buyers at auction from like a broader geographic radius? Bill Nash : Yes. Craig, yes. So wholesale performance was outstanding and I think a lot of it was driven by the appreciation. It's interesting. As COVID unfolded, we saw some of the most rapid depreciation in a very short period of time. We also saw the most rapid appreciation. I think from the depth of COVID, there's probably a $3,000 to $4,000 swing in vehicle value. So obviously, as that's going up and appreciating that, that certainly is a tailwind. But I wouldn't minimize the execution of our teams as well. Especially early on in the quarter, there was a lack of supply, a lot of this stuff because some of the traditional auctions just weren't open and up and running. And our team pivoted quickly, got the sales -- all of our sales virtually. They continue to be all virtually. We're working through individual local mandates as far as when we can open them back up. But our goal will be to get ourselves physically opened again, but also complement them with the simulcast, and that's the plan as we open up the new auctions going forward. As far as the impact of the digital, look, I think having digital will do nothing but enhance the overall experience because it will hopefully open up the door to more participants. And you know if you have more folks at your auctions, hopefully, that drives the price up. And then we can offer more in price line. And I think you saw that. I mean, we're really proud. We had that record by rate this quarter, and it's not by a little bit, it's by a lot. We were traditionally here lately. We've been in the low 30s. Now with this -- what we saw this quarter, it was the high 30s. So it was a substantial step up. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Can you give us a little bit more color on your gross profit per unit on the retail side through the quarter? How that trended? And what your outlook is as it relates to that? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the GPU was fairly consistent throughout the whole quarter. I mean, I think we've been able to prove that we can manage in all different types of environments, the GPU. And I don't see any reason going forward that we wouldn't be able to continue into that traditional range. But I always give the caveat that we continue to test and check pricing elasticity because we want to make sure that we're driving the most total gross profit dollar. So I think as you look forward, I don't see a reason why we can't maintain those GPUs. Seth Basham : That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you mentioned some efforts around strategic sorting. Could you provide some more color what you're referencing there? Bill Nash : Yes. So I think, first and foremost, we want to accelerate and prove in our core buying channel. So that's both off-site and the in-store appraised lane. And the way I would think about that is it's not only our processes but leveraging data and technology better. And I think that's important because we're the largest buyer of used cars in the U.S., and we value more than 6 million cars on an annual basis. So continuing to make incremental changes there is significant. We also want to open up some new buying channels and expand our capabilities with some of our partnerships and other businesses. And then I think another area that I kind of put into the vehicle acquisition bucket is, we will continue to invest in our wholesale business. We're working ona new auction platform. The auction platform has been here since I started CarMax. And it's time to upgrade that. So the way we think about it is on a bunch of different fronts. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Bill, I know you said you feel great about your performance in Atlanta and some of the older markets, but can you help quantify the usage of your omni-channel capabilities in markets where you've had that capability for a few quarters? And then I guess related to that, is there any way to size the overall sales lift that you think omni generated for you in the quarter? Bill Nash : Yes. First of all, Scott, I think the incrementality of omni is really difficult to measure. Because you can't say, okay, well, you measure it just by who has it delivered to the home or who's in the store because we have lots of instances where customers that are coming to us anyway. They start online and they decide to have a home delivery or folks that come to us now because, \"Hey, I want it delivered to my home, I want everything online\" and end up coming into the store. I think for us, obviously, rolling this out is because we believe that this is a superior model to deliver to the customer. And at the end of the day, it's all about sales and market share. But I'd tell you, along the way, the most important thing is us measuring the customer experience, no matter how they want it. So we'll be looking at different metrics, the CEC engagement, online progression, in-store only customers, alternative delivery customers, but we'll really be focused on the experience of those customers and how they feel about that, and we'll continue to move that needle. And everything that we've seen, whether it's in older markets or newer markets that we rolled this out, it is being very well received. And this is despite having some just inherent headwinds, and I would go back to the CECs. They're immature. We have a lot of new folks there. We have new technology. And while we expected customers to migrate to this, we did not expect them to migrate as quickly. So in this quarter, we had more leads than we could actually handle in our CECs at certain times. So that's a headwind. And I think there's probably some experiences that we can improve on that customer experience as well. So again, we feel great about where we are today. And while it's the end of the rollout of omni, we really think about this as kind of like day 1. This is where we're just getting starting -- started, and this is kind of where we springboard to the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : First off, Celeste congratulations. Thanks for all the help all over the years. Much appreciate it. So my question, I guess, Bill, it's bigger picture in nature is, I'm listening to you today, and congrats on the execution here in a very tough environment. You're really performing well. But I hear your partner saying is that, look, you're almost caught -- you're moving path, a crux in the crisis with COVID and your -- you also now will begin positional leverage a lot of the omni-channel investments you made. So the question, if you look at -- if you just take a step back yourselves and just kind of look at the overall environment, I mean, how would you characterize just the demand, right? The consumer demand now, maybe -- I recognize you don't give guidance, the demand dynamics now and going forward versus what they were pre-COVID? Bill Nash : Yes. It's Brian, I mean, you can imagine, that's a hard question to answer. I mean, look, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace. We have, obviously, high unemployment. You've got the rising COVID cases. This is an election year that always can throw a little wrinkle into things. We've got continued social challenges. But all that being said, I mean, I think if you look at the back half of the quarter, when you look at July and August performance and how that trend continued into month-to-date to September, we feel good about where we are, given all those uncertainties, and yes, there could be -- just with the external environment, there could be some bumpiness just for some macro factors. But again, we -- what we work on is things beyond -- we look beyond the next quarter. But I'd tell you, I feel great about where we are right now, and we're going to keep progressing. Brian Nagel : If I could just slip one follow-up in -- sorry, Stacy, I think you may have alluded to this. I know you typically don't talk about quarter trends. But how is the business here early in fiscal Q3 or September tracked relative to what you saw in the last couple of months of Q2? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, first of all, you're right, Brian. I don't like talking about these trends. But I do think in this environment and look I hope we get away from really having to talk about the environment. That will mean things are a lot better. But I think in this environment, it's appropriate. And so yes, September month-to-date, we're seeing the trends of July and August continue, which is great, considering there's still headwinds out there. So, we feel great about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : I just wanted to follow-up on the digital process a little bit further. And I guess three parts to the question. One was on kind of an update on remote appraisals. If you can just share the capability set there and then future upgrades to it. Secondly was on -- in the past, Bill, you've mentioned, I think, 1 out of 10 multichannel transactions were home delivery. So I just wanted to see if you could update us on how that's trending? And then the last thing was 70% of transactions, it sounded like were multichannel. So was just curious about in the more mature markets, how that percentage would compare to, obviously, some of the markets that have just been getting the capabilities more recently? Bill Nash : Okay, Michael. So first of all, on remote appraisals, like I said in my opening remarks, if you're going through our customer hub, trying to buy a car and bring it to your home, we absolutely give you the option to either get an estimate or an appraisal. We are -- we've got some tests going on right now with instant cash offers in markets and look to expand that. So there'll be more on that in the near future. As far as the 1 out of 10 home delivery, it's actually the way I've talked about in the past is really alternative delivery. And under alternative delivery, it's the curbside pickup and the home delivery both combined. And in the first quarter, we saw that spiked up during the quarter. We ended up around that 10%, a little bit under 10% after the -- at the end of the first quarter. And again, I would say that we're still below that 10%. And most of the customers, even though they are progressing online, they still prefer to come into the store. And then on the 70% CECs, again, that 70% of our customers are engaging with the CEC. Doesn't necessarily mean they're all doing online progression. That's the 50% number that I gave you. And I think as far as how does that compare to older markets, that kind of thing? Look, I think, it continues to grow. That 70% if you remember the first quarter, I talked about it, and it was north of 60%. So we've even seen a growth there. Now some of that is the fact that we finished rolling it out. But I would expect to see that number continue to go up, just like I would expect to see the progression of customers go up in the future as customers want a more personalized experience. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Just had a couple on the SG&A side, you talked about the marketing expense going up during the second -- in the second half of the fiscal year. Could you give us a sense or quantify the degree of expense expansion we might see there? And how should we think about what the normalized expense per unit should be here going forward? And I have a follow-up. Bill Nash : Yes. Yes, you're right. I said it will be going up in the second half of the year. But I think the way to think about that is in the context of overall SG&A. And we've said in the past, hey, look, it's going to take 5% to 8% comps to leverage. We've picked up some efficiencies in SG&A. We absolutely expect to reinvest those back into the business. So even with the step-up, I worry less about what the advertising cost per car is, and more about in this context of the SG&A. Even with the step-up, we still would expect on an annual basis to lever at that 5% to 8% comps. Keep in mind, in any given quarter it can dramatically, dramatically swing. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And I'll just add to that. With -- during the pandemic, we took strong and rapid actions to lower our cost structure. With business improving, we've brought back a lot of those operational spend dollars. But we did make some structural changes in staffing and in operations that we do expect will yield savings moving forward. We're also focused, as we've mentioned a couple of times on efficiency and our CECs. That being said, we are in growth and investment mode. So I look at those savings that we're targeting to be at least partially reallocated to higher ROI and our strategic investments that are aligned with our growth plan. So the savings will be used to help fund our growth. And as Bill mentioned, the way to think about it is leverage with that same 5% to 8% comp that we've communicated in the past. Bill Nash : Yes. And we have -- I would say, we have efficiency savings, I think, across the board. I mean it's not only store efficiencies, it's not only CEC. I think about kind of also improvements in logistics, improvements in wholesales. And I think all of those provide opportunities, whether it's SG&A savings, SG&A reinvestments, cost of goods sold reinvestments. So it's not just one or two areas. I think it's across the business. Rajat Gupta : Got it. And just on the SG&A, more of a housekeeping item. The other overhead costs of $65 million, I mean that seems to be tracking well below normalized levels, is there still some catch-up to be had there here in the next quarter? Just curious as to if there were any permanent reductions there? Or how should we think about that going forward? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think the way to think about that is roughly half of that favorability year-over-year reduced specifically to the cost-cutting efforts we undertook as well as certain spending limitations given the environment. But we reduced contractor spend our pre-open spend, relocation spend. And so those are cost cutting efforts. The other half is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was about higher self-insured loss last year and litigation last year versus this year. So again, half kind of cost cutting, the other half, I would view more as a onetime. Rajat Gupta : Understood. Sorry, just to wrap that up, the 5% to 8% comment that you made, is that now -- is that like a rolling forward comment here? Just curious as to when that drops down to a lower level? Or is that still like something you should expect for like the next 12 to 18 months or 24 months? I'm just curious how we should be thinking about that leverage dropping lower? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I would think of that as an annualized number moving forward. Again, from quarter-to-quarter, there's so much that can happen within a quarter. So I would view that, again, moving forward, at least the next 12 months is how we're viewing the business. Bill Nash : Yes. And the other thing I would tell you is, and I said this in one of our previous calls, if all we were focused on were omni this year, then we would have -- that guidance, 5% to 8% would have been less than that. It would take less to do that. But obviously, to Enrique's point, we are in investment mode. And there are some things that we're investing in that will pay benefits in other parts of the business. So for example, improvements in wholesale may not necessarily drive the leverage on a retail cost per car sold. But it will drive improvement in wholesale, which will be top line and bottom line benefits of the Company. So I think that's another important thing to remember in this whole discussion as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Rick Nelson : A quick question for Tom, related to CAF. Last quarter, you talked about an expected loss rate of 2% to 2.5%. If I look at this quarter's provision, $26 million, that represent 1.4% of receivables originated. Charge-off rate was below historical norms, curious about the expectation as we push forward. Tom Reedy : Okay. Yes. Let me do a couple of things. One, I'll start with give you just a little more color around the loss provision. And then we can talk about that expected range. But -- we talked about income was materially supported by lower loss provision. At $26 million versus the $45.5 million last year, that reflects approximately $55 million of additional reserve for the originations we had in the quarter. And then $30 million of favorable development arising from the loss performance we saw in economic adjustment factors. And I will say that we -- the economic adjustment factor has actually tempered the impact of our strong loss performance and where we landed on the provision. So while we saw loss performance of substantially better than what we had booked at the end of Q1, that merited some release of the reserve. But as I said in my prepared remarks, 3.2% the overall allowance still reflects some uncertainty facing the economy and consumer behavior. And with regard to our target range, obviously, we can't do anything about the portfolio that's out there, what is -- it's what is. But we've seen improving performance. We're pretty confident about the capital markets and our ability to finance. I mean, if you look at our last deal, we had a pretty significant spread between APR and cost of funds, one of the highest in recent memory. So even in a little bit higher loss environment, that spread allows you to still make a good return on the business. So we looked at all those factors. And we're comfortable for a period of time, riding a little bit higher than the 2% to 2.5% range, given where everything is falling out. We believe it's worth the investment to get the return on that money rather than giving the profit to someone else right now. Rick Nelson : Got you, okay. That's helpful. Then I think 6% this quarter haven't seen that since 2016. Any spread targets as we push forward? Tom Reedy : It's hard to say. The 6% -- the expansion we saw this quarter really as a result of funding costs coming down. And then obviously, when we look at our rates that we charge customers, our goal is to make sure that we are a market lender, and we're competitive. We're not angering anybody about what the offers they see from CAF. And during the quarter, we didn't see any need to drop APRs. And as I always say, we'll look at that on a go-forward basis. If competition allows us to preserve those margins, we're going to preserve them. And if competition gets aggressive and the market demands a little bit less margin in the finance business, we'll act accordingly. But right now, we feel good about where we are. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Question on used gross margins per unit, they were up 50 bps because your dollar profit was relatively flat as despite -- and ASPs went down. But how were ASPs able to go down despite higher auction prices? Were you just more self-sufficient in the quarter? Bill Nash : Yes. So it's a great question. So the ASPs went down. The reason they primarily went down is because of that mix shift that I cited earlier where we sold a higher percentage of older vehicles. So that takes it down. Acquisition price was fairly flat. I think there's a lot of inventory that we bought during the quarter that hasn't necessarily sold that is a little bit more expensive. But the main driver of what you see there is the mix shift in age. David Whiston : Okay. And then is it fair then that you're probably not going to assume that's going to be a long-term trend, especially if they can get better? Bill Nash : The mix shift or just the average selling price going down? David Whiston : The mix? Bill Nash : The mix, look, I mean, the beauty of the business is, we'll have out there whatever our customers are demanding. So if the customers want old or less expensive cars, then we're going to make sure we put them out there. So that's all driven by customer demand. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Just had two things. One was around the credit side. Just curious if there's any incremental color perhaps that you all can share around roll rates, the impact of forbearance, government programs and then also deferral. So kind of overall, what's -- how is it that you're feeling about CAF? And then just a quick follow-up. Bill Nash : Sure. Yes. To speak to the quality of the quarter from a CAF perspective from loss side, I think, we felt like we had a really good quarter. Important to note from the improved losses within the quarter. A couple of reasons we believe that is : First, as you might remember, in Q1, we were actually unfavorable from a loss perspective, where in Q2, we were favorable. So we believe there's some swap that was going on there. You talk about payment deferrals. Certainly, we also were able to provide payment relief to our customers. And we did a good job throughout the quarter there. Payment deferrals were higher in -- earlier on in the quarter. We predominantly reverted back to typical practices. But we know that, that's provided some relief to our customers, avoided loss, helped to lower delinquency. And then certainly beyond that, also, the federal stimulus within the quarter certainly put money in the pockets of our customers, and that allowed them to pay their bills. And frankly, also, there was just less places for them to spend their money. So we think that probably helped the losses as well, speculative. But as far as roll rates are concerned going forward, hard to say on a go-forward basis, what's going to happen, a lot of uncertainty out there. But for the quarter, we felt real good that we were able to take care of our customers, and we're happy with where the numbers sit right now. From a reserve perspective, obviously, that uncertainty is reflected in our reserve. But all-in-all, good quarter from a loss perspective. Michael Montani : Great. So that's helpful color. And then just the other main question I'm getting before and during this call today is around market share. I've had folks who are a bit concerned because there's some other smaller competitors that might be growing faster. And the data we've seen from Cox is really showing that over the summer, the industry contracted like a mid- to high single-digit rate. But I guess I'm curious to know kind of what you all would be using to gauge that as well? How do you see that unfolding into the back half of the year as we think about some of the multichannel capability set? Bill Nash : Yes. So look, I think we talked a little bit about the beginning of -- in the first quarter how our sales, I think, were disproportionately impacted, just given the volume that we run through our stores. And the occupancy restrictions that we had to work through, the operating models that we had to work through, i.e., having stores that only could have appointment only or only curbside pickup. We talk about market share on an annual basis. And look, I think the whole goal of omni, obviously, is to deliver this better customer experience. But at the end of the day, it's to increase market share regardless of what the macro factors are that are out there. So we'll continue to progress forward. I mean, obviously, in this quarter. Again, I can't talk about how proud I am of the team. I mean you go from one quarter having negative 40-plus comps to the very following quarter starting to comp again with record earnings. And you've done that even in light of the fact that we're still working through occupancy restrictions, about half of our stores still have an occupancy restriction, although the bulk of them are at 50%. And I think the stores have done a phenomenal job being able to work within that 50%, you get less than that, it really gets hard. Also with the CEC and the mature and CEC and the inventory. So again, I feel good about where we are. And I think this is a springboard for us just to continue to grow sales and market share. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : I wanted to ask more about the store opening plan for 2022. I guess it's a little bit below trend. I would imagine it's probably the environment, but could just remind us what kind of goes into opening a store, what's the time line, how long will that takes? And maybe just more directly, is this the new cadence of store openings we should expect beyond 2022? Or is this just product environment. Then I have a follow-up. Bill Nash : Yes. Chris, I think the way you should think about this is it's more a factor of just ramp time. We were going to open up 13 stores this year. We've been opening up 13 to 16 for several years. The plan was to open up 13. But just given where we are this year and what it takes to start ramping, that number is more reflective of construction timing than anything else. So I wouldn't, at this point, read into that. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. That's helpful. And then preopening, can you just remind us how that works? Obviously, you're not opening stores right now, but it benefit to other overhead for the next several quarters. But can you just remind us what -- I mean, obviously, it's depending on the number of stores you open, but what's a good rule of thumb for preopening expense per store, something else you can give us to think through the impact of no store openings unless you do that? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, those costs will start rolling in a good three to four months before a store opens in a material way. And I would say on average preopening cost is going to roll about $1 million, $1.5 million, but that will be spread out again over that time period. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you, Carol. Well, listen, thanks for joining the call today and for your questions and your support. We are definitely confident in our ability to seamlessly merge our world-class in-person experience with our world-class online experience, along with our diversified business model, we'll continue about earnings and market share gains for many years to come. I just need to thank again all of our associates. They are the reason that we remain a disruptive force within the used car industry. And finally, I've got to give a shout out to Celeste as well and best wishes to her. She's been here for a long time, knows CarMax better than anybody that I know. So she will absolutely be missed, but I wish her well. So again, thank you for your time today, and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you once more for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Frole, Vice President, Investor Relations. Stacy Frole : Thank you, Carole. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. I am here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President of Finance; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CAF operations.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. You may have seen in our announcement in this morning\u2019s 8-K that Tom will retire on February 28. Before we get started, I want to take a moment to congratulate and thank him for his tremendous contributions to CarMax. Tom\u2019s expertise, strategic focus, and leadership have helped us build a best-in-class finance organization, and he has been instrumental in guiding us through the largest transformation in our company\u2019s history. Tom, thank you for all that you have done. We wish you the very best in your well-earned retirement. Jon Daniels, who many of you already know, will continue leading our CarMax Auto Finance team and will begin reporting directly to me. On today\u2019s call, we will first discuss our third quarter financial performance and then turn to an update on our omni-channel experience and other strategic initiatives before opening it up for questions. Our diversified business model spanning retail, wholesale, and auto finance combined with strong execution by our teams and disciplined cost management, delivered another great quarter of strong EPS growth even as retail sales were hampered in the back part of the quarter due to macro factors. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF continued to deliver solid results this quarter with income up 55%. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will provide more details on customer financing and CAF contribution shortly. Our wholesale business also delivered strong results with volumes up 10.8%, which was driven by a record third quarter appraisal buyer rate. The strength of our buyers, our algorithms, and extensive datasets enabled these results with only a slight year-over-year decrease in wholesale gross profit per unit to $906. This is despite sharp depreciation in the broader market. All auctions will run virtually throughout the quarter. Total retail used unit sales were up 1% compared with the same period a year ago, while used unit comps were down less than 1%. Gross profit per retail used unit for the quarter was 2,151 comparable with last year\u2019s third quarter. However, this feud doesn\u2019t really paint a full picture of how the macroenvironment impacted our retail business. For the first part of the quarter, we achieved mid-single-digit comp growth, continuing the positive momentum from the end of the second quarter. However, the election approached and there was another surge in COVID-19 cases, which tightened occupancy restrictions and shelter-in-place orders, we saw demand soften. As a result, sales trended down in the back part of the quarter. This trend has continued into the first 2 weeks of December with sales down approximately 4% year over year. As a reminder, last year, we had a strong fourth quarter and an added benefit of Leap Day. Looking ahead, we are confident the sales trends we experienced in the latter part of the third quarter and into December are shorter term in nature. Today, approximately half of our stores have occupancy restrictions in place due to state and local government mandates. Of these, more than 40 stores have mandates limiting capacity to 25% or less. Even with these restrictions, our omnichannel experience is allowing customers to connect and transact with us in more ways than ever. As we continue investing in our systems, our people, and our offerings, we are confident the experience we offer will continue to attract more customers to CarMax and better serve all their needs whether that\u2019s online through our CECs, in-store, or through whatever combination they choose. I will speak to the ongoing enhancements to our omnichannel experience later. But first, I would like to turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on our third quarter financial performance, and then to Jon who will provide additional detail around consumer financing. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, other gross profit increased $4.7 million or 5%. EPP profits grew by $4.6 million or 4.8% due primarily to favorable adjustments to cancellation reserves and profit sharing revenue recognized in the quarter. In the third quarter, we maintained our ESP penetration rate at 60% comparable with the prior year quarter. On the SG&A front, we continue to do an excellent job in maintaining cost discipline, while supporting the growth of our omnichannel experience and pursuing other investment opportunities. For the third quarter, expenses decreased 1.2% or approximately $6 million to $479 million. SG&A per unit was $2,461, a year-over-year leverage of $57 per unit on the quarter. The decrease in SG&A was driven by a $16 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a $15 million decrease in other overhead costs. The decrease in other overhead costs was due primarily to pandemic-related reductions and year-over-year favorability due to lower litigation expenses in the third quarter. These SG&A reductions were partially offset by the following notable SG&A expense drivers for the third quarter, a 13% increase in advertising expense, the opening of 11 stores since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, which represents a 5% growth in our store base, and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives.  As we discussed in our last call, we are increasing our marketing spend in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, this spend included additional investments in SEM, content, and social as we look to drive customers to our digital properties. This spend on the quarter brings our year-to-date advertising expense to $144 million, up 2% or $3 million when compared with the same 9-month period last year. On a full-year basis for fiscal year 2021, we anticipate advertising spend will be up roughly $25 million when compared with the prior fiscal year. The vast majority of this increase will occur in the fourth quarter and will be driven by heavier broadcasting in support of the next evolution of our brand campaign. This campaign will focus on clearly differentiating our brand and demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel experience. We will also continue spending on ROI-based digital investments. From a capital allocation perspective, our priority is to fund growth initiatives. We continue to be focused on aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omnichannel experience, the expansion of vehicle and customer acquisitions, and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. In the third quarter, we resumed construction activity on new stores that we had paused in the first quarter due to the pandemic. We are currently planning to open 8 to 10 new stores in FY \u201822. Our unique business model generates a significant amount of cash. So, while our priority remains on investing in our growth, this strength allows us to also return capital back to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we resumed our share buyback program repurchasing approximately 1.2 million shares for $109.2 million in the quarter. We have $1.4 million remaining \u2013 $1.4 billion remaining on the current authorization. Finally, we ended the quarter modestly below our historical leverage target of 35% to 45% adjusted debt to capital. As you can see, our diversified business model, operating excellence and strong cash generation positioned us extremely well as we manage through a dynamic environment. I will now turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique and good morning everyone. As Phil mentioned, CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners continued to deliver solid results. For the third quarter, net of 3-day payoffs, CAF\u2019s penetration was 45.7% compared with 43.3% a year ago. Tier 2 accounted for 19.5% of used unit sales compared with 20.4% last year. Tier 3 was up slightly to 9.7% compared with 9.5% a year ago. Recall that the distribution realized across the tiers is a function of both lender behavior as well as the credit mix of applicants. Year-over-year, CAF\u2019s net loans originated grew by 7% to $1.8 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.6%, up from 8.1% a year ago and 8.2% in the second quarter. Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.3% versus 5.7% in the same period last year as we realized significant benefit from lower funding costs. We continue to efficiently fund our business through the ABS market and our most recent transaction in October was very well received by investors. CAF income was up 55% to $176 million in the quarter, reflecting reduced loss provision, plus an increase in both interest margin and average managed receivables. The provision for loan losses was $8 million, resulting in an ending reserve balance of $432 million for the third quarter, the total reserve at 3.17% of managed receivables, which is moderately lower than the 3.23% at the end of the second quarter. While we recognized significant favorability from losses relative to the expectations at the end of Q2, we believe the reserve adequately reflects the unpredictability of the current environment and the uncertain consumer situation. Before turning the call back over to Bill, I would really like to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding performance of our many associates dedicated to certainly credit needs of our customers. Our ability to consistently provide exceptional customer service from purchase to payoff was never more apparent than in this past year and is yet another aspect of our business that sets us apart from others. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. Our teams continue to execute in this dynamic environment. Despite the near-term market challenges that follow the trajectory of the pandemic, our fundamentals remained strong. We have an agile business model that generates a significant amount of cash and we are in the best position within the used car industry to further expand our market share and deliver shareholder value over the longer term. The CarMax experience is about putting the customer in the driver seat and providing them with a great service regardless of how they choose to interact with us. To do that, we have been transforming every aspect of our business, from supporting systems to how we operate the physical stores in order to create an efficient, seamless process for the customer and our associates. Last quarter, we announced that we had completed the national rollout of our omni-channel experience. We now have a common platform in place across all of CarMax that leverages our scale, nationwide footprint and infrastructure and empowers our customers to buy vehicle on their terms, whether that\u2019s online, in-person or a seamless combination of the two. While the current platform enables customers to buy vehicle online, some parts of the transaction such as appraisals, transfers and appointment scheduling, require assistance from customer experience consultants. We are now focused on enabling self-service for all components of the sale and will deliver significant improvements over the next two quarters. For example, we have been testing instant appraisal offers on carmax.com. This feature gives customer \u2013 give customers an offer on their vehicle in 5 minutes or less. Based on these initial tests, we are rolling out this offering more broadly and expect it to be available for standalone appraisals nationwide by the end of the fourth quarter. We are on track for most of our customers to have the ability to buy vehicle online independently that they choose by the middle of next fiscal year. Even with the ability to transact online, customers appreciate having real-time support available to them should they choose. And we believe there is untapped value and focusing resources on supporting the online sales process just as we know there is greater value in having friendly, helpful associates in-store to assist in the in-person sales process. This is why we developed centralized customer experience centers for our CECs. Again, the advantage of our omni-channel model is that customers get to choose how they progress their experience. In the third quarter, approximately 70% of our customers who bought a car from us interacted with our CECs and more than 50% of our customers chose to advance their transaction online. In addition, we are seeing those customers progress more of the transaction online, but still preferring to take ownership of their vehicle at one of our stores. For the third quarter, alternative deliveries chosen by customers, including home delivery and curbside pickup, were less than 10% of sales. Having just completed the initial rollout of our omni-channel platform last year, it\u2019s too early to quantify its impact across CarMax as a whole, but we already have evidence that supports the benefits of a seamlessly integrated in-store and online experience. It was just 2 years ago that we launched our first omni-channel experience in Atlanta. Now, after 2 years and continued testing on pricing and advertising, we can see that our omni-channel experience is delivering sustained growth in this very competitive market. During this time, the Atlanta market has outperformed the company with high single-digit comps in the third quarter and 2-year stack comps of 20%. We are also very pleased with how our other markets are ramping as our omni-channel offerings mature. In addition, the number of alternative deliveries in the Atlanta market, including curbside pickup and home delivery, has increased by 45% when compared with the third quarter of last year, although this remains a relatively small piece of overall sales. As we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings, it\u2019s important to educate our customers on our omni-channel experience to differentiate and elevate the CarMax brand and our position in this evolving marketplace. Within the next week, we will introduce the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign that began last year to increase awareness of our core omni-channel capabilities. We want customers to understand that CarMax offers the ultimate flexibility to shop and buy on their terms, their way. In combination with the improvements and enhancements we are making to our omni-channel experience, we are also implementing additional pricing and marketing tests beyond the national campaign I just mentioned in select markets. We expect to continue reporting attractive gross profit per retail unit in the fourth quarter above $2,000. However, we anticipate the year-over-year change in this metric will be larger than what we have experienced in recent years. Finally, before we take your questions, I would like to let you know that we plan to host a large Virtual Analyst Day event following our year end earnings call. There is a lot going on at CarMax and we are excited to share it. And we think that this forum will provide us the opportunity to go into greater detail on the strategy and metrics behind our continued progress and the innovations we are delivering to our valued customers. We are finalizing the dates and logistics and plan to e-mail invitations in early 2021. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations department should you have any questions regarding this event. Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys and happy holidays to you. Bill Nash : Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning. Bill, can you help us better understand the correlation between the slowing sales trends in the quarter and how the occupancy restrictions ramped up like -- just any kind of color you might be able to provide in terms of how big of an impact you think those occupancy restrictions had on the business? Bill Nash : Yes. So, Scot, as I said in the opening remarks, we saw continued good growth in the beginning of the quarter, and really up until a week or so before the elections really when we saw a decrease, a step down, and I think part of it was the election, but I also think that\u2019s when we started seeing these tighter restrictions. I noted that we had more than 40 stores that are 25% or less. If I go back to June, we didn\u2019t have that many stores, I think there was almost \u2013 it was about half of that, that actually had that type of restrictions. And of those, more than 40 that are at that 25% or less, most of those \u2013 the majority of those are at 20%. So, it\u2019s hard to quantify exactly the restrictions versus the shelter-in-place, but we\u2019ve absolutely see a step down in those markets. If you think about some of the larger markets that are under these restrictions, we have absolutely saw a step down once the restrictions went into effect. Scot Ciccarelli : That\u2019s really helpful. If I could just add a quick follow-up on something you have already said, you talked about higher marketing ramp in the fourth quarter and then maybe a little less GPU. Is it fair to assume those similar trends would kind of roll forward to the next year as you guys try and get people to understand the changes in the business? Bill Nash : Yes. So, obviously \u2013 in the third quarter, we stepped up a little bit. The fourth quarter, we\u2019re stepping up. We feel like we have a great opportunity in front of us. And so, it takes a little while to be able to build awareness. So, I would expect next year, there would be a step-up, but we\u2019ll talk more about that at the end of the fourth quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Alright. Thanks, guys. Bill Nash : Thank you, Scot. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bill Nash : Good morning. Michael Montani : I wanted to dig in a little bit more, if I could, Bill, on the experience that you\u2019ve seen in Atlanta. I thought that was some helpful color. So, I was hoping you can share a bit more. And then, just confirming, by the middle part of calendar \u201821, if I was hearing you right earlier, it sounded like the experience would go basically frictionless for online, so consumers could decide to speak to a person live, but if they wanted to basically just click a button and do the transaction themselves, they could do that as well. So, I just wanted to make sure I understood that and then some extra color on the multi-channel would be great. Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you for your question, Michael. Yes. So like I said, in Atlanta \u2013 Atlanta was the first market that we rolled this to, and we\u2019ve been testing Atlanta as kind of the first market that we roll new things. In fact, we actually have a new user experience out there in that and some other markets right now that allows the customer to build the order \u2013 start building the order themselves. So, I think the Atlanta performance is indicative as these markets mature longer. Because if we look at other markets, we have about 70 stores and then the corresponding markets that those stores are in that have been open for at least a year. And we see performance from that group better than the rest of the company, which just shows that as it matures, they continue to ramp. And in fact, we have \u2013 some of those early waves are currently producing nice, strong comps. So, we\u2019re encouraged by all that. I think, some of the things we\u2019ve been doing in Atlanta and a few other markets we haven\u2019t rolled out to other places, which is one of the reasons we want to extend some of the testing, which is the comments on the advertising and the pricing. On the second part of your question, the frictionless, yes, I mean, right now, a consumer can buy online from us. But as I mentioned, there\u2019s parts of it where the customer experience consultant needs to get involved and work with the consumer, and we\u2019ll make great strides. The focus right now is on self-serve, so we\u2019ll make great strides in the next two quarters. And I think the majority of our customers will have that option to progress self-serve without the CEC [ph] if they choose to do that. And we think we\u2019ll be in good shape in the second quarter, middle of next fiscal year. Michael Montani : Thank you for that update. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys and congrats, Tom and Jon on the retirement and new roles. Just a question here, Bill. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of concern around the same-store sales being down, and I understand the regulatory regime or sort of the shelter-in-place requirements are driving some of this, but when you look at wholesale sales, they\u2019re up 10.8%. So, there\u2019s some part of the market that\u2019s functioning really well even under these constraints, and a skeptic would say, hey, listen, there\u2019s a big problem here because your wholesale sales are really strong. Somebody\u2019s retailing some cars on the other side and you\u2019re not, and an optimist could say, hey, listen, that 10.8% is indication that ex these constraints, you\u2019d really be crushing it. I mean, how do you interpret sort of that big gap there between the wholesale and the retail? I can\u2019t remember any gap quite that big as of before, so just trying to understand what\u2019s going on? Bill Nash : Sure, John. Look, I think there are a lot of factors going into the mix for the third quarter. I mean, obviously we talked about the COVID surge with the lockdowns and restrictions. We talked about the election. You bring up an interesting point. Higher used prices for the third quarter, keep in mind, a lot of the cars that are sold in the third quarter are bought earlier on in the month leading up into that. And you know from the earlier months that there was very steep appreciation. And so, what happened is, the other factor that I hadn\u2019t really talked about in this quarter is, you have a tightening of the gap between late-model used and a new. So I think that\u2019s also a factor in there. And then, I think the external \u2013 there is some external sources out there that would tell you that used car industry has gotten softer. And we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019ve seen depreciation in the marketplace throughout the quarter. Now, value year-over-year is still above what it was a year ago, but we\u2019re certainly seeing the depreciation kick in. John Murphy : Okay. But I mean, it just does seem like there\u2019s an indication \u2013 I mean, lower prices does not necessarily mean lower unit sales and lower profits for you and actually kind of conversely means the same. Lower pricing, as long as you manage it well, means your volume goes up and your profits go up. So, I mean, it just seems like, as the market normalizes, there\u2019s the potential for real volume increases and that wholesale number is maybe a better harbinger of what\u2019s to come as opposed to what just happened with your same-store sales comp. That\u2019s just sort of our interpretation it seems like where things are headed? Bill Nash : Well, keep in mind, the wholesale, when you\u2019re \u2013 we flip that wholesale inventory very quickly. And obviously our wholesale inventory is dramatically different. What we\u2019re selling through our auctions is dramatically different than what we\u2019re selling on a retail lot. But in the wholesale, you\u2019re getting cars real-time and selling them real-time. On the retail side, we\u2019ve got inventory that we\u2019ve been working through that we bought earlier leading up into the quarter. John Murphy : And just \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, just \u2013 the wholesale restrictions are not the same obviously as what you have on the retail side, right? So wholesale is not hampered by any kind of restrictions. Is that correct? Bill Nash : No. The wholesale side, I mean, we chose to keep all of our sales virtual. There are actually some markets that we could have turned the physical sales back on. But just given the nature of bringing a bunch of folks into our store locations to keep our associates safe, we\u2019ve decided for the quarter to keep everything virtual. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Sharon. Sharon Zackfia : I was hoping \u2013 hi. I was hoping, by the way, I suspect that Tom is going to spend all of his retirement surfing, so congratulations to him. But wanted to delve a little bit deeper into kind of what you\u2019re seeing in Atlanta, which sounds really encouraging. And I think you mentioned, Bill, some tests on pricing and marketing to maybe accelerate that dynamic for the rest of the country. So, I guess, at the end of the day, my question is just \u2013 is there a way to increase awareness more quickly of the omni-channel offerings? Because it seems that it\u2019s happening, but it seems that it\u2019s happening maybe more slowly than some of us had originally anticipated. So, I\u2019d love to hear more about the effectiveness of different kinds of marketing and/or programs that you can do to accelerate national awareness? And then secondarily, on the pricing test, I didn\u2019t catch if any of that was related to pricing for delivery as opposed to actual unit pricing? Bill Nash : All right. There\u2019s a lot in that question, Sharon. Let me see if I can get it all. I may have to ask you to repeat part of the question. But first of all, I think it\u2019s important we worked really hard to get a common platform out there which we got in the third quarter. And that was a significant milestone for us because we really needed \u2013 we wanted everybody to be on the same platform before we started to go out and educate the consumer. And like I said, in the third quarter, we planned by the end of the year to kind of kick off this new multimedia marketing campaign, which we\u2019re really excited about. And I think it does a nice job of really differentiating us from whether it be traditional dealers or online dealers and really highlights the capabilities and the flexibility that we have. And so, we\u2019re excited. It\u2019s going to be everything that you can think of from broadcast to digital, to social, to out-of-home, so you think about billboards, that kind of thing. So it really is a broad sweeping effort because we do think there\u2019s an opportunity to educate the consumer and drive that awareness. Now, on any awareness advertising, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it takes a little time because when you do awareness advertising, the majority of the folks that are hearing it aren\u2019t necessarily in the market. But the point is to make sure that when they are in the market that we\u2019re top of mind. So that\u2019s going to be the real focus. And I think that will be a catalyst. I mean, we really haven\u2019t done that up to this point. So we\u2019re excited to get that out there. I think the other part of your question was the pricing on delivery. Is that \u2013 could you clarify that part? Sharon Zackfia : Well, you talked about pricing tests in the current quarter and that impact on GPU. I just didn\u2019t know if that was going to include some sort of price elasticity dynamic around the cost of delivery to the consumer? Bill Nash : Yes. So, we\u2019re constantly \u2013 when I made the comments earlier, I was speaking more specifically to the GPU pricing or retail pricing. We\u2019re constantly doing test on delivery to the consumers, and we\u2019ll continue doing that as well. We have been doing that. And I would expect, as we go forward, we\u2019re very analytic when it comes to doing things like this and whether it\u2019s pricing, it\u2019s advertising, whether it\u2019s the transfer fees. We\u2019re going to do combinations. We\u2019re going to do them by themselves. There\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of different things that we\u2019re trying this quarter. Sharon Zackfia : Sorry. Can I just ask one follow-up? So, you\u2019re doing the pricing and marketing test in some markets this quarter. How quickly can you pivot if you see something encouraging there? Bill Nash : I think we can pivot very quickly. First of all, we\u2019re going to have the awareness campaign going on everywhere. And then we\u2019re going to fit some of these markets with some additional marketing. Some of it may be awareness and maybe more acquisitions. So, I feel very confident that we can pivot quickly. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Jon Daniels : I think I\u2019d just add that now really is the right opportunity and it\u2019s the right time for us to invest through the increase in marketing, through testing lower pricing. We\u2019ve rolled out our omni platform. We continue to enhance the capabilities of omni. So we believe now is the right time to do that. And we\u2019re excited, as Bill said, about our opportunities moving forward to grow the brand and to grow our market share. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning and congrats, Tom. My question is around the pricing tests as well. You\u2019re signaling as much as a 9% decrease in free cash GPU year-over-year in the fourth quarter, which would be unprecedented out of times of market shock. So, this presumably is a pretty widespread test that you plan or very deep test in terms of the price cuts that you\u2019re planning. Could you give us some more color on exactly what you\u2019re thinking relative to prior price tests and how we should think about the go forward? Bill Nash : Yes. Good morning, Seth. Thank you for your question. Yes, this is going to be in \u2013 the pricing test, we\u2019ll be trying in several different markets. And I think the way you should think about it, if you look back historically for us on any given quarter, we probably \u2013 when you look at year-over-year GPU, we\u2019ve probably been in a band somewhere in the \u2013 on a given quarter, $30 to $50 on year-over-year. That\u2019s kind of the range. On full year, it\u2019s probably a little bit tighter than that. And I would say, you would \u2013 my comments are saying, you should expect it outside of that normal range. And that will allow us to do some \u2013 you know that we always do testing throughout the quarter, but this will give us more flexibility to do some different things. So, again, we\u2019re excited about some of the combinations of things. And we also know that not every market is going to respond the same way to different levers. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be checking. Seth Basham : Got it. All right. So, presumably it\u2019s a little bit more widespread than normal in terms of your test and the depth of the price cuts could be deeper than you\u2019ve done in the past. Is that the right way to interpret it? Bill Nash : Yes. Seth Basham : Very good. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you, Seth. Operator : Your next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one and a follow-up on CAF. Could you help break out what the benefits were in the quarter from just the economic factors versus the losses you took on the underlying growth? I believe you provided the split during the last quarter. Is there something similar that you could provide for this quarter? And then how we should look moving into the fourth quarter? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes. Thanks for your question, Rajat. Yes. So, really, the quarter \u2013 Q3 was fantastic for us from a losses perspective, no doubt. We saw $10 million of net losses, which really is much lower than our expectation going into the quarter. And I can break that down. A number of things worked in our favor there. First, I think we had excellent execution at CAF. You have the consumer who was very willing to and able to make payments. And obviously when the units are lower, then losses are going to be good in a quarter. We also had an inventory of charge-offs that hit us in previous quarters that we were able to liquidate within the quarter. So that was really a good guy that is probably not something we would expect on a go-forward basis. And obviously as we sold those vehicles in the \u2013 in our auctions, they performed very well as well from a wholesale recovery rate. So, a lot of things are working together to give us a really strong quarter that I would necessarily expect going forward. But that being said, with a strong quarter, our provision was $8 million and that really reflects the positivity that we saw in the quarter and we do believe there\u2019s some benefit going forward. A realized \u2013 that $8 million provision inherent in there, we had $1.8 billion of originations also which included the restarting of the Tier 3 originations that we had a hiatus in over the summer, so a number of things that we feel relatively positive that drove our provision. That being said, when we look at our model and our economic adjustment factor all in and we set our reserve, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as we see in the upcoming quarter and quarters ahead. So, we feel good about the reserve. I would tell you all-in in that reserve, there\u2019s going to be the Tier 1, the Tier 3 and the recovery cost volume in there. We\u2019re probably a little higher than what we would normally expect under normal times from our cumulative loss factor. But overall, we feel like there\u2019s just uncertainty out there. The reserve is adequate, great quarter, but we\u2019re cautious in what lies ahead. Rajat Gupta : Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. And just on CAF, noticed that the volumes sold through the captive was up roughly 7% year-over-year, while the Tier 2 plus Tier 3 combined absolute volumes were down year-over-year. Was that just a deliberate effort? And would that have an influence on your same-store comps in the quarter? And then, should we expect like that mix going back to more normal levels in the fourth quarter and next year or should CAF remain at this aggregated level? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes, a fair question. As I mentioned in my comments, really ultimately you\u2019re going to see that penetration or the distribution across the tiers is going to be a function generally of two things, lender behavior and mix. In this quarter, it really was a mix thing. I don\u2019t think there was much change amongst lenders certainly CAF as well. So, I think that\u2019s really what drove it and so mix next quarter, hard to say. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out. Jon Daniels : Yes. And I think, Rajat, if CAF hadn\u2019t picked them up, they would have been picked up by somebody else to your part \u2013 on your question on same-store sales. Bill Nash : I think, Rajat, the other piece on cap that I would call out got a little bit overshadowed this quarter because the loan loss reserve adjustment is really just the underlying profitability of the CAF business. When you take a look at the net interest margin on the quarter and you consider that this is profitability that we\u2019re going to continue to see over the life of the loans, that\u2019s a considerable tailwind for us moving forward. Since we do not employ gain on sale for our financing, you\u2019re going to continue to see that benefit for the life of the loan again. So, again, considerable benefit this quarter and moving forward just from the profitability of our CAF business. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Makes a kind of sense and thanks for all the color and good luck. Bill Nash : Thank you. Jon Daniels : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Brian Nagel : Thank you for taking my questions. First off, Tom and Jon, congratulations for the retirement and the new role, so, look, at the risk of kind of beating the dead horse here. Just with regard to the sales trends, maybe I\u2019ll squeeze a couple of questions together. But clearly, the comparisons \u2013 year-on-year comparisons got \u2013 were more difficult here in the fiscal third quarter. And if you look at the stack it up, so to say, the business actually strengthened in Q3 versus Q2. So the question I have is, as you look at the trend in the quarter, where you called out that slowing, did that coincide with comparisons getting \u2013 turning more difficult? And then the second question I have with that is, we talked a lot about the COVID restrictions in the stores. Could you discuss any spread in the business between stores where there were more significant COVID restrictions and maybe stores where there were less restricted \u2013 there weren\u2019t the restrictions in place? Bill Nash : Yes, Brian. So, I\u2019m not going into specifics on particular stores or really markets. I will tell you on the COVID restrictions in the shelter-in-place. I mean, certainly there are states like California, Chicago area that have some of the strictest requirements. And if you look at pre-restrictions versus post-restrictions, like I said earlier, we absolutely saw a step-down. Obviously we can compare it to the rest of the country, and especially the ones that don\u2019t have any restrictions. On the \u2013 I think, the first part of your question, can you repeat that part? Brian Nagel : Yes. Just from a comparison standpoint. So if you look at \u2013 your comparisons turned more difficult in Q3. In aggregate, used car unit comps actually improved on a 2-year basis Q3 from Q2. So the question I had is, as you were looking at the business intra-quarter, did the trends step down as comparisons got more difficult? Bill Nash : Yes. So, if I look at year-over-year, certainly last year, third quarter and fourth quarter were both strong quarters and it built kind of throughout the quarter. So I think it\u2019s a combination of \u2013 the comparisons got a little tougher, but then you also have a lot of these other external factors that are weighing in. Brian Nagel : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Alright. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, thanks and congratulations, Tom and Jon. I wanted to circle back on the wholesale business with your pivot online. You are perfecting this omni-channel experience in retail. What does an omni-channel experience look like in wholesale, if that\u2019s the right analogy? It feels like there is a ton of disruption happening in that space too. Jon Daniels : Yes. No, Craig, I think you\u2019re thinking about it the way that we\u2019re thinking about it. We have two customer sets. We have our retail customers and our wholesale customers. Both of them are equally important. And we talk a lot about providing an omni-channel experience for our retail customers. But our wholesale is also an area that I\u2019ve talked about in the past as one of our strategic initiatives continue to invest. And we want the experience for our wholesale customers to match up with what the wholesale customers want. So just like with the retail customers, there\u2019s different needs. Some dealers like coming to physical sales, some like doing a combination, some like just the virtual. And we put ourselves in a position now that we\u2019ll be able to accommodate all of that. So when we turn physical sales back on, there\u2019ll actually be simulcast. And you can come in person or you can bid virtually. And we think that this is \u2013 this will be great. As we move the business forward, it allows more dealers to be able to attend ourselves without physically having to be there. And we think more dealers attending, more dealers buying, that\u2019s a good thing. It will drive up prices and it allows us to put more on vehicles. So, you\u2019re thinking about the same way, we\u2019re trying to put together the best experience for both customer sets. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Jon Daniels : Thank you, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hey, thanks everybody. Bill, really appreciate the extra color on the KPIs and on the omni that\u2019s going to be incredibly helpful, especially going forward. Can you give us some color on the attach rate of products like F&I and other things on the front end for \u2013 specifically for the alternative distribution units and color on the GPU of vehicles through alternative distribution versus non-alternative distribution, if I could describe it that way? Bill Nash : Sure, Adam. Yes. So on products like the finance, the MaxCare, when you look at alternative delivery, finance is pretty consistent to the in-store experience. I think, on the MaxCare, there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s very similar on the \u2013 one of alternative deliveries like an express pickup or a curbside, that\u2019s fairly consistent with what the store process is. It\u2019s down a little bit on the home delivery, but that\u2019s an area that I think that we can usually continue to focus on and move the needle. As far as GPU goes, the way we manage our business, the GPU isn\u2019t different on a vehicle that\u2019s delivered to someone\u2019s home or alternative delivery if it\u2019s done at the store, curbside or express pickup as it is on our lot. So I don\u2019t see a difference in that. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Rick Nelson : Hi, good morning. Congrats to Tom and Jon as well. So, question regarding CAF, the contract rate jumped this quarter at 8.6%. We were 8.2% on last quarter. You are raising APRs in a declining funding cost environment. I\u2019m curious why that is taking place and could you use CAF \u2013 take lower spreads, I guess, to drive more same-store sales? Bill Nash : Sure. Yes, thanks for the question, Rick. So, as mentioned before with kind of the penetration across Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, mix was a big play there. Similarly within CAF, really there wasn\u2019t an increase in interest rates for those people coming through the door it\u2019s really the mix of those coming through the door. So it was a higher interest rate customer coming through as opposed to a rate change. With regard to what rates should CAF setting can we run at a lower interest rate environment, obviously given the overall interest rates, I think we have always said really, we keep a very close eye on the market, its CAF\u2019s job to provide a very competitive offer out there as a sole Tier 1 lender and we always do that. We will keep an eye on key metrics like 3-day payoffs and obviously what we see out there from competitors in the marketplace and we feel like right now, we are in a very good position, but yes, there wasn\u2019t not a rate increase driving that, purely a mix thing. Jon Daniels : Yes. I think the same, the question earlier, Rick, that those \u2013 if we hadn\u2019t picked up this customer, somebody else would have picked them up as far as the impact on same-store sales. Rick Nelson : Okay, thanks for that. If I could do a follow-up on CAF as it relates to provisioning on a go-forward basis, the allowance account is down 3.2% of receivables managed. I think in the past, you have talked about future loss rate expectations of 2% to 2.5%. Would you expect that allowance proportion to come down here over time? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes, Rick, right on with those numbers. Yes, 3.17% for the quarter, I think a couple of important things to point out with that number versus the 2% to 2.5% reported historically. And in that 3.17% is the Tier 3 business as well. We have historically said that\u2019s roughly 1% of the receivables and accounts for 10% of the loss, whereas the 2% to 2.5% we referenced is generally in our Tier 1 business. So, you really want to net that out. Also, with the adoption of CECL in our reserve, we also have to put money in for the actual cost to recover, which again not contemplated in the 2% to 2.5%. So, when you net those items out, we are still probably a little above that range. But I think that\u2019s reasonable given the environment we are in. Obviously, we expect to hopefully trend back to normal as things get back to normal. But right now, there is a level of uncertainty both and we would say that both with regard to our origination volume of the $1.8 billion and the existing portfolio. So, again, little higher than maybe our targeted range after you net those things out, but hopefully things go back to normal soon. Rick Nelson : Okay, got it. Thanks for the color. Bill Nash : Thank you, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just one quick clarifying question first and then I have a bigger question. On CAF, can you speak to what the provision was on new originations? I think you gave at the last couple of quarters just a lot of noise trying to understand what you are provisioning for on new loans? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes, happy to give that. We said $1.8 billion of originations. $66 million of the reserve was attributed to that. Couple of things again to remember, based on the last question, just as a reminder, in there is Tier 3 volume. As a reminder, we had hiatus over the summer, but we added back and started that back up in September. So that\u2019s going to be inherent in that $66 million and net recovery expense, but yes, $66 million on the $1.8 billion. Chris Bottiglieri : That\u2019s really helpful. And then, just kind of following up on the appraisal questioning, so really impressive buyer rate especially the used car pricing environment stabilizing, just trying to understand, is it like \u2013 again, I apologize if you guys went through this, but has something structurally changed in the appraisal rate that\u2019s allowed you to raise it so materially and sustain that GPU? Like are you finding, you are getting higher proceeds at auction that\u2019s keeping the GPU flat or keeping cost out, like what\u2019s allowing you to raise the buy rate, but still keep that GPU? Any color there would be appreciated. Bill Nash : Yes. So, Chris, I mean, if you have noticed the last few calls, we have been continuing to have strong buy rates. And I really do think it\u2019s a testament to our buyers, the professional buyers, its algorithms, some of the technology we are using. So I think we are just getting sharper on being able to respond quicker to market dynamics. I noted in some of the remarks earlier, we saw depreciation throughout the quarter. And depreciation generally is a headwind for buy rate. And so, while the buy rate came down a little bit from quarter-over-quarter, we are still real pleased with where we are. It also tells us that the consumers like the offer that we are providing. So I think it\u2019s a combination of factors. And I think our auctions are \u2013 given the attendance of the sales, I think they are commanding strong values, which helps as well. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. Okay, thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. On the pricing cut pilot program coming up, was that something that was 100% planned for a long time once you have the capabilities ready or is some of this in response to more competition? Jon Daniels : This is \u2013 it\u2019s kind of evolved just off the learnings that we have been discovering. And it\u2019s one of those things that we feel like now is the right opportunity and the right time and based off some of the results we have seen in some of the other tests that we are doing. So I think it\u2019s really kind of an evolution on what we have been testing and it\u2019s a continuation of that. David Whiston : Okay. And longer term, is there \u2013 as omni-channel rolls out, can we be more optimistic about some SG&A scaling? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Certainly, coming out of the \u2013 a couple of things. Coming out of the pandemic, we have a very strong and disciplined approach to cost management. There are some structural savings that we do expect coming out of the pandemic, specifically in corporate overhead, CEC efficiency, maybe to address some of your questions and also in vehicle reconditioning. Now that being said, what we are doing is that we are reinvesting those savings into our growth. Now as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s the right time for us to invest. We are going to continue to invest and grow our omni functionality, the acquisition of customers and vehicles and our new store growth. So, that\u2019s how we are thinking about the savings is really we are a growth company and we are going to continue to invest, but we do expect to see some efficiencies in our CECs to answer your question specifically. Bill Nash : Yes. David, I think the CECs is just one place that we can continue to get efficiency. I think there is still some store efficiencies with reconditioning and procurement. I think we are even \u2013 I think we have got some efficiencies just from a corporate overhead and on facilities that kind of thing, where we have got some improvements we are making in logistics. So, I think there is a lot of efficiencies. I think to Enrique\u2019s point, we want to continue to invest in the business. So as we are picking up efficiencies, we want to continue to move the business forward. So, hopefully that provides you little bit more color. David Whiston : Yes. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. It\u2019s me again. Just quick question on advertising, I guess like two questions. One is when you think about, it looks like it\u2019s probably up like 50% in Q4, if I did that math right quickly. But is this primarily just like operating investment in terms of raising awareness for your new capabilities and stuff like that? And then, how do you like think of the payback, is that just a longer term payback? And then two, kind of as more of the business shifts online as you rollout your omni-channel initiatives, like how do you think about the go-forward level investment in advertising? Do we step back from these levels or do you think this is like the new norm and it just gradually creeps up as the business shifts online? Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. So, Chris, the step up is primarily awareness or brand building. And as I said earlier, it\u2019s going to be kind of a multimedia campaign, a lot of different components to it. It really is about educating the consumer on our new capabilities and how we have a differentiated experience. And when you do awareness advertising, yes, you will get some benefit from it, but it\u2019s really geared towards changing the consumers\u2019 awareness, which happens over time. So, it doesn\u2019t happen the minute that you turn it on. And so, as I look forward, beyond the fourth quarter and we will certainly have more details after the fourth quarter, as I said earlier, I would \u2013 I think it\u2019s safe to say that we will continue to have a step up in advertising year-over-year, because again, awareness just doesn\u2019t happen overnight nor does it just sustain itself without some reinforcement. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the answer. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn it back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. As always, I want to thank you for joining the call today. I want to thank you for your questions and your support. Our future success continues to be focused on providing an exceptional experience and that\u2019s not only for our customers, but also for our associates. We are going to remain committed to our purpose and our values and we will continue to grow and create value for our shareholders. I want to thank all of our associates for everything that you do on a daily basis, taking care of each other, taking care of our customers. You are the reason that we offer the most compelling customer-centric experience within the industry. I wish all the associates and I wish all of you all a happy holiday and we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2021 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Frole, Vice President, Investor Relations. Stacy Frole : Good morning.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? William Nash : Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of exciting news to cover today. Our comments will focus on material fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 performance insights, updates on our digital enhancement and, of course, the Edmunds acquisition, which we announced this morning. Then we will open it up for your questions.  For the quarter, total retail used unit sales were down less than 1% from last year's record sales, and used unit comps were down 2.3% when compared with the same period a year ago. It's worth spending a moment on the events driving our results for the fourth quarter.  As we discussed on our last call, entering the quarter, retail sales were pressured due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, which tightened occupancy restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Sales began to accelerate towards the end of December and into January. By the beginning of February, we were trending towards mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter, excluding the impact of Leap Day in the prior year.  However, starting in the middle of February, retail sales were affected by the severe winter weather across a large portion of the U.S., closing more than 65 stores in 1 day. Sales were also impacted by delays in tax refunds relative to last year's timing and a lower inventory position due to COVID and weather-related production constraints.  On a 2-year stack, total retail used unit sales for the fourth quarter of FY '21 were up 13.8%, and used unit comps were up 8.7%. March sales were robust when compared with both COVID-impacted March last year and a record March in 2019. During the month, the initial distribution of tax refund and stimulus checks began, weather improved and customers continue to respond favorably to our ongoing digital enhancement and other strategic initiatives.  In addition, the underlying metrics we track, including website visits, online progression and activity at our customer experience centers, or CECs, indicate continued healthy demand for used vehicles as we head into April. Full year market share data indicates that our share of 0- to 10-year old vehicles in our current comp markets fell from approximately 4.7% in 2019 to 4.3% in calendar 2020. We had strong momentum entering the year, and we're gaining significant market share up until the start of the pandemic, when 95% of the country was under shelter-in-place orders and approximately half of our locations were closed or under limited operations.  As markets reopened and our omnichannel experience was launched nationwide, we began gaining market share again. During the last 5 months of 2020, we saw market share gains, and we expect those gains to accelerate in 2021.  Atlanta, where we have been in operations since 1995, and our most mature omnichannel market, continues to outperform the company, maintaining its market share in 2020, despite pressure from COVID. During the last 5 months of the calendar year, our market share in Atlanta increased 13.8%. Over the past 2 years, since we first introduced our omnichannel experience, our market share in Atlanta has increased 10.9%.  Retail gross profit per used unit for the fourth quarter was $2,086 compared with $2,195 last year. This GPU is consistent with our expectations and commentary on the last quarter's call. It reflects the impact of the expanded pricing and marketing test we rolled out in select markets, in combination with our national multimedia marketing campaign and the improvements to our omnichannel experience. Early results for these tests were positive, so we expanded to more markets in the quarter. We're going to continue with testing, while also monitoring macro factors. We expect to maintain attractive margins above $2,000 in the first quarter. Enrique will provide additional details around the profitability flow-through on different aspects of our business that are contributing to the success of these tests in just a moment.  Our wholesale business delivered another good quarter when you consider the impact of one less auction day compared with the same period last year. For the fourth quarter, wholesale volume was down 1.2%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was comparable to the prior year at $990 per unit. We estimate the one less auction day in this quarter impacted the number of wholesale units sold by several percentage points.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance; and then to Jon, who will provide additional detail around customer financing. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, other gross profit decreased $4 million or 3.2%. This decrease was due to a $14 million reduction in service profits driven largely by our previously announced year-end thank you bonus for 22,000 full and part-time associates across the company, many of whom work in our reconditioning and service functions, bonuses related to production [glitches] [ph] and company support pay related to COVID.  Partially offsetting this was favorability in EPP and third-party finance fees. EPP grew $2.6 million year-over-year for the quarter driven by a favorable reserve adjustment and an increase in profit sharing revenue. This was partially offset by lower sales volume and a slightly lower penetration rate in the quarter. Third-party finance fees improved by $7.7 million in the quarter primarily due to the renegotiated fees with our partners, which Jon will talk about shortly.  For SG&A, expenses for the fourth quarter increased 14.7% or approximately $71 million to $556 million. SG&A per unit was $2,713, a year-over-year deleverage of $368 per unit on the quarter. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of $33 million or a deleverage of $160 per unit; an increase in advertising expense of $23 million or a deleverage of $115 per unit, which was in line with our previously communicated expectations as we focus on heavier support for our next brand campaign; and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives.  Our approach to SG&A and costs heading into next year remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our business at this inflection point in our industry, specifically in marketing and in our strategic initiatives.  Regarding marketing. As we head into next fiscal year, we expect our spend to remain elevated with similar per unit trends experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021. Our advertising spend will continue to focus on clearly differentiating our brand and demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel experience, in addition to ROI-based digital investments that are delivering strong results.  Included within this spend is an increased focus on vehicle acquisition. We believe we are well positioned to aggressively grab market share through the promotion of our omnichannel experience and new product offerings, such as Love Your Car Guarantee.  We also remain focused on ensuring we are appropriately managing our spend, targeting specific areas of opportunity. This includes our CECs, which are maturing and becoming more efficient and effective through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing with the goal of ensuring customers get the right support. This past year, our CECs were more efficient than the prior year, and we expect this trend will accelerate in FY '22.  Regarding our SG&A leverage point in FY '22. We would expect to require a 5% to 8% comp on a 2-year stacked basis in FY '22 to lever in FY '22. As previously communicated, in periods of investment like we are in now, we'll need to be at the higher end of the range to lever. This 2-year comp approach is reflective of the impacts of lapping over COVID and due to the continued investments in the business we made this past year.  Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the financial aspects of the pricing tests we ran in the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we like what we have seen so far. While these tests confirm what we have historically seen regarding price elasticity, several factors have changed, resulting in a stronger flow-through from the increased sales and, thereby, resulting in greater profitability.  These factors include higher profitability levels of our CAF originations, our lower variable cost structure as we continue to leverage our centralized CECs and the favorable changes to our third-party lender fee structure. As mentioned earlier, we will continue to perform pricing tests in the first quarter, while also monitoring macro factors. Our goal remains to maximize both unit sales and long-term profitability. Our unique and diversified business model still generated a significant amount of cash this past year, despite a challenging environment. From a capital allocation perspective, this positions us well to reinvest in the growth of our core business, fund new growth opportunities such as our announced acquisition of Edmunds, and return capital back to our shareholders.  Regarding Edmunds, we expect to pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and equity. We anticipate this transaction will close in June and expect their financials to have an immaterial impact to CarMax's EPS in fiscal year '22. We are confident this transaction will provide significant shareholder value creation over the longer term.  We continued executing our share repurchase program, and during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $66 million. We currently have $1.34 billion of authorizations remaining, and we are committed to returning capital back to our shareholders.  For capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $350 million in FY '22. As we've pivoted our business to be more technology driven, the profile of our CapEx has followed suit. Approximately 1/3 of our capital spend in FY '22 will be focused on investments in technology, up from about 15% just 4 years ago.  In FY '22, we plan to open 10 new locations, with the first grand opening expected later this month. As was the case with our more recent openings, these locations are predominantly cross-functional stores and have a smaller footprint and can leverage our scale and the presence of other locations in nearby markets. Our national footprint and nationwide logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax, and we remain committed to an appropriate level of investment on these differentiated assets.  We are confident that the foundational investments we are making in our omnichannel experience, our proprietary tech stack and our highly recognizable and trusted brand set us up for accelerated market share gains in 2021.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners once again delivered solid results. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43.5% compared with 43% a year ago.  Tier 2 was up slightly to 21% of used unit sales compared with 20.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 9.5% compared with 10% a year ago. This distribution across the credit tiers is primarily reflective of the credit mix of applicants observed in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, CAF's net loans originated were comparable to the prior year quarter at $1.8 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 7.9% a year ago and down slightly from 8.6% in the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is attributed to the mix of CAF customers seen within the Tier 1 space, rather than an increase in the rate charged to these customers.  Regarding the portfolio. The overall interest margin increased to 6.4% versus 5.8% in the same period last year, as we continue to realize significant benefit from lower funding costs. Our most recent securitization in January closed with a near record spread between the APR we charge to customers and the rate we pay to fund the receivables. Our ABS investors continue to recognize the consistency and performance of the CarMax origination channel, and we appreciate their support.  CAF income was up 68% to $188 million in the quarter, reflecting a reduced loss provision, plus an increase in interest margin. The provision for loan losses was $5 million, resulting in an ending reserve balance of $411 million for the fourth quarter. The total reserve is 2.97% of managed receivables, which is lower than the 3.17% at the end of the third quarter. Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has trended downward over the past 3 quarters, as our customers have exhibited a willingness to make payments, even in these continued challenging times. We believe our current reserve is adequate and considers both the positive payment behavior recently observed as well as the future uncertainty of the macro environment.  I would also like to provide an update on the arrangements we have with our third-party lenders that Enrique referenced earlier. Our agreements with our partners have resulted in CarMax historically receiving a $300 participation fee for each of the agreed-upon finance contracts purchased within the Tier 2 space. Within the more subprime Tier 3 space, where CAF keeps approximately 5% of the volume, CarMax has historically offered lending partners a $1,000 discount for providing financing to a customer that we believe would otherwise not be able to purchase a vehicle from CarMax. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, this Tier 2 participation fee increased to $400, and our Tier 3 discount was reduced to $750. If this structure have been in place for the entirety of FY '21, and penetration rates remain the same, it would have resulted in annual savings of approximately $30 million or $40 on a per unit basis.  With regard to future changes in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space, as of March 2021, CAF has begun to methodically increase its percent of Tier 3 volume beyond the 5% level, and we anticipate reaching and maintaining a 10% share in Tier 3 by May 31 this year.  CarMax will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments, if and when, we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Bill? William Nash : Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. Our 2021 fiscal year was one of the most challenging operating environments we've ever faced. But due to our ability to act quickly in rapidly changing circumstances, we delivered new customer experiences and continue to innovate, while remaining financially strong. That financial strength has enabled us to continue to aggressively invest in our core business and pursue new growth opportunities.  Some highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact are as follows : the completion of the national rollout of our omnichannel experience, giving us a common platform across all of CarMax that leverages our scale, nationwide footprint and infrastructure; the move of all wholesale auctions into a virtual environment; the national expansion of our new online instant appraisal offering on carmax.com and edmunds.com, strengthening our leadership as the largest buyer and positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers; and finally, the introduction of the Love Your Car Guarantee, an industry-leading signature customer experience. All of these were possible because of our exceptional associates. They came together to take care of each other and our customers, while also innovating for the future. Customer response to our omnichannel offering is strong, and we are continuing to work to further improve and enhance the digital customer experience at every step of the sale.  One critical advantage of our omnichannel model is the ability for the customer to choose how they progress their experience. As previously discussed, our initial rollout of our omnichannel platform enables customers to buy a vehicle online. The parts of the transaction may have required assistance from our CECs.  In the fourth quarter, we made significant progress enabling self-service for all components of the sale. Exiting the quarter, approximately 25% of our customers were eligible to buy vehicle online independently if they chose, up significantly from the third quarter. We expect most of our customers to have visibility by the end of the second quarter.  Additionally, in Q4, about 3/4 of our customers advanced their transaction digitally, with approximately 5% buying the vehicle online. We consider an online purchase to be when all major activity leading up to the purchase is performed independent of our stores. We expect our online sales will grow robustly, as we continue to enhance our marketing and digital capabilities.  As a reminder, we will be hosting a Virtual Analyst Day on May 6, where we will take a deeper dive into our online capabilities and our technology and data advantages. At that time, we will also discuss new metrics around online orders and how they are fulfilled as well as providing insight on our longer-term outlook and expectations.  Now I'll take a moment to highlight some recent enhancements we have made to the customer experience. First is our online instant appraisal offer, which allows us to quickly give customers an offer on their vehicle. This offering was first introduced and tested on edmunds.com in June. In February, we completed the national rollout of this offering on carmax.com. Early response has been strong, with online buys quickly exceeding our expectations, providing us with a clear pathway to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we launched the ability for customers to get penny-perfect, transactable financing offers in our online checkout process. With these enhancements, customers can apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in the store. We are rapidly expanding this feature to our overall customer base in the first quarter.  We know our customer-centric approach is a differentiator for CarMax, and we will never stop innovating on behalf of our customers. In January, we introduced our new industry-leading signature customer experience, Love Your Car Guarantee. This gives customers the ability to take 24-hour test drives before committing to purchase, and extends our 7-day money back guarantee to a 30-day money back guarantee, which is unmatched in the automotive industry. It's too early to identify trends, but preliminary results show these offerings are highly valued by our customers.  As we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings, it's important to educate our customers on our omnichannel experience to differentiate and elevate the CarMax brand and our position in this evolving marketplace.  In the fourth quarter, we introduced the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign that began last year to increase awareness of our core omnichannel capabilities, which was highly successful. We set records every week for web visits since being introduced, reaching more than 8 million weekly visits by the end of February.  After the campaign launch, web traffic and Google query volumes were both up over 25% versus the prior months. We want to continue this momentum and ensure customers understand that CarMax offers the ultimate flexibility to shop and buy on their terms, their way. Accordingly, as Enrique mentioned earlier, we are planning on increasing our spend on both awareness and acquisition marketing in FY '22.  We will continue to evolve our business as an omnichannel retailer by innovating at an accelerated pace, leveraging our scale across technology, data, talent and physical assets to unlock opportunities to compete across the used auto ecosystem. This is why we're excited to announce that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Edmunds, one of the most influential and popular automotive research sites in the world.  Over the past years, our teams have had the opportunity to collaborate with Edmunds on a number of strategic initiatives, including our instant online appraisal offer and leveraging its proprietary content on carmax.com. We've been extremely impressed with its technology, content and online experience as well as its talented tech and creative teams. We believe we can both unlock additional value by working together to streamline the user experience across the entire car buying and selling journey, in addition to identifying other digitally focused opportunities. One thing that has become clear is that we share a commitment of delivering the highest quality online experience to our customers and dealers.  Edmunds is a widely recognized and deeply trusted brand. It will continue to operate its core business independently and will remain focused on delivering confidence to consumers and excellent value to its dealer and OEM clients. We are confident this transaction will drive shareholder value as we are able to leverage our combined size, scale and extensive industry expertise for the benefit of both businesses.  To sum up, we are very proud of our performance during this difficult year. We're even more excited about how our continued investments in our existing business and in Edmunds are positioning us to be further differentiated and even more competitive. We expect robust top line, bottom line and market share growth for the upcoming year that is a result of not only lapping COVID, but demonstrating the impact of the investments we've made and the experiences we are providing.  At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Carol? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question this morning comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I have two questions, but I think the first is pretty [vast] [ph]. Your inventory has gone down a lot in March, kind of an unusual amount. Can you talk about how you're positioned from an inventory perspective to meet demand and whether there will be any kind of unusual cost this quarter to ramp back up inventory?  And then the second question was on CAF and the expansion of Tier 3. Can you give us any idea of what the profitability is of Tier 3 on a per car basis relative to the $750 that you discount to the third-party lenders? William Nash : Okay. Sharon, first, I'll talk about the inventory, and then I'll let Jon talk about the CAF question. So you are right. At the end of the quarter, our saleable inventory is low. But again, that is a function of the fact that we had some COVID and weather shutdowns. So in the rise in COVID, we had to shut down some production locations. We also had some production locations shut down because of the weather. And so that's really why we're a little bit behind on saleable inventory. At the end of the quarter, I think we were down about 20% on saleable inventory.  I would just point out, though, that if you look at our overall inventory year-over-year, we're actually up a little bit. So we've got the inventory. It's just a matter of producing. In fact, I think we ended the quarter north of 155,000 units.  So it's just a matter of working through that. And we're confident we have the capacity. Now it's just a matter of getting the inventory back to our target. So -- and I'll let Jon answer the CAF question. Jon Daniels : Yes, Sharon, thanks for your question. On Tier 3, moving from 5% to 10% for CAF, the profit per unit on that vehicle is relatively consistent to our Tier 1 vehicle. It will sit depending on funding costs between $2,000 and $2,500 in this funding environment. We'll see how it plays out over the course of the year, and that's -- you can compare that to the $750 we would pay in a discount.  I think an important point to note here is, though, because of CECL regulation, we will have to, as we book those loans, reserve for the full loss impact of that immediately. And so therefore, this will probably be a headwind for us in the upcoming year. But obviously, the lifetime profit will play itself out over time. Sharon Zackfia : Can I just ask a follow-up? So on your website right now, it says there are 24,500 cars. Is that -- is there some disconnect there between what's on the website versus what you actually have? William Nash : Yes. So Sharon, on the website, all that you're seeing right now is saleable inventory. We have very little that we put as far as coming soon. What you don't see on there are customer transfers. You don't see the transfers that are going between stores, so say, a hub store and a satellite. You don't see sale pending.  If you took all that into consideration, you actually at least double the number that you currently see on the website. And then, of course, it doesn't include the work in process, which is really what gets you to about the 150,000 total units that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Craig Kennison : Bill, you've said that you want CarMax to be the largest buyer of used autos from consumers. What is your estimate for that total addressable market in terms of the number of cars? And then on a related note, can you share any metrics to illustrate your activity levels or your buy rate activity on the online appraisal tool that you're using to source those cars? William Nash : Sure. Craig, so first of all, let me just clarify something. It's not that I want to be the largest buyer of used cars from consumers. We're already the largest buyer of used cars from consumers. I certainly want to continue to buy every single one that we can. If I think about the total addressable market, 40 million used cars exchange hands every year. And in that number, obviously, is person to person. So that's how I kind of think about the overall market.  And as far as the online appraisal offer, yes, we're really excited about this. It's exceeding our expectations. On carmax.com, we really got it up kind of middle of February, so we only have the partial month. And obviously, we've been testing, so we have seen some trends before that.  But if I look at the quarter as a whole, the online buys were about 10% of the total appraisal lane buys that we made. And of that, just because we got the carmax.com up towards the end of the quarter, most of those buys came through our relationship with Edmunds. But as I said, just the trajectory of where we see those things going, we think, in very short order, we'll buy more than anyone else online from consumers. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to kind of maybe stay on this line of questioning on sourcing vehicles. I mean, obviously, the market itself is very tight right now without a lot of flow into the secondary market, the used market. But there's also a lot of dealers and maybe even some new competition that are grabbing vehicles or buying vehicles as well to resale. And particularly with the new vehicle dealers, they're higher in the funnel and getting access to some trade-ins, obviously, as people are selling new vehicles. So Bill, just curious, as you think about this going forward, how much of this tightness in supply that you can get for yourselves to retail is transitory? And how much of it is somewhat more of a secular shift than an increased focus by the dealers and maybe the other competition and is making it a little bit harder to get inventory?  And then also, is this Edmunds purchase or acquisition, really, the key here is focused on sourcing vehicles online? Is that really what this is? Because I know it's a big lead generator for a lot of dealers, so there's a lot of other angles to what Edmunds delivers. But is the key to you sourcing these vehicles directly from the consumer online? William Nash : All right, John, I'll try to hit all this. You got a lot of stuff in there. First of all, as we've been talking about for several quarters, vehicle acquisition is a strategic initiative that we've been focused on. And to your point, if you look at the supply out there, yes, the supply is probably going down a little bit versus prior years. The great thing for us is that we get such a large amount through the appraisal lane. It really helps to alleviate anything outside of CarMax.  Our focus with the online is to continue to drive as much as we can of buying vehicles right from the consumers, and we see this as a potential to really increase our self-sufficiency, which we think is a huge competitive advantage. And again, it's one of the reasons why we've been focused on it, and we'll continue to invest in here.  Now as far as Edmunds goes, look, the online piece of Edmunds, that's only a small piece. It's only a small benefit of the whole transaction. That's not the reason that we have decided to acquire Edmund. It absolutely has been a successful partnership on that piece of it, and we think there's a lot of opportunity to still do on the acquisition.  But there's other components. We've been working with the content, for example. There's other things at Edmunds that we feel like having the 2 companies come together will take 2 great companies and strengthen both of them.  So self-sufficiency and buying through the A lane, increasing that, whether it be through online or through the traditional A lane is absolutely a focus for us going forward. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. It's important to remember as well that we buy cars better than anybody. We always have and we'll continue to do so. All we're doing now is that we're extending that to online. So the combination of in-store and online, we're just going to continue doing that better than anybody. John Murphy : Can you guys just give us an idea of where you think you will go in sourcing vehicles directly from the consumer as opposed to auctions? I know we traditionally thought around 50-50, but sometimes -- different times, it kind of ebbs and flows. I mean, is this kind of thing where you're going to 60% to 70% to 80% source from consumers and move away from auctions? William Nash : So John, the way I think about it is more on the self-sufficiency side. First of all, whether it's a retail or a wholesale car, we want them all. But I think -- when I think about from a self-sufficiency side, we've been somewhere in the, let's call it, 35% to 50% self-sufficiency over the, let's call it, the last 5 years.  I would expect this to take us to numbers that really are historic highs, if not kind of breaking the ceiling on the self-sufficiency. So our goal is to continue to see how far we can push that number on the north side. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Bill, I was hoping you could provide some more color around the price tests. How broadly do you expect to extend those? What have you learned in terms of the sweet spot for discounts? And how much lift are you seeing from tests, thus far? William Nash : Yes. So Seth, I'll talk a little bit about kind of the extent of the test, and I'll let Enrique just talk about the focus here. But -- so as I said in the comments, we did expand the test. We have the test in a bunch of stores.  Now I would say that we never would -- will expect to do this in all the stores. It just doesn't make sense. And we know the differences between markets and different stores, and the elasticity is very different in different markets.  So as I've said in the opening remarks, we're going to continue with this into the first quarter, but we're going to monitor the macro factors. And obviously, there's a lot going on right now as far as from a macro standpoint. We talked a little about, in John's question, that the -- a lot of supply has tightened up a little bit. You've got some things going on, on the new car side as far as new car availability. You -- we've got tax refunds that are going that have been delayed and kind of pushing into March. You've got stimulus money out there. So there's a lot of different things kind of going on.  Also macro factors, you have to watch. You just continue to monitor what your competitors are doing. And whether that's their sales price or their margins, you have to take all that in consideration. So we'll continue with these.  Like Enrique said earlier, we're pleased with them. But I'll turn it over to Enrique and let him just expand on some of the profitability stuff. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, absolutely. So it's important to remember, we're solving for 2 things, right? We're solving for driving increased sales to lower prices. But at the same time, we're also driving for increased profitability.  And what we've seen in this test is really 2 things. One is the same level of sales elasticity. However, what we've seen is greater profitability flow-through, and there's really kind of 2 reasons why we've seen that greater flow-through.  Number one is higher finance income, so CAF originations much more profitable in this environment as well as the renegotiated third-party finance fees. And the second is just lower variable costs as we migrate towards our CECs.  And so we've been really pleased with the results. We've seen, again, increased sales and increased profitability. So we expect to continue to test and, as Bill mentioned, while also watching the macro environment. Seth Basham : That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, when do you expect to have better data on whether or not you plan to roll this out across the chain? Obviously, this is a unique period of time with all the macro factors you mentioned. Could this be a multi-quarter test before you have a clear picture? William Nash : Yes. I think it's a great question, Seth. Just because of those macro factors, we generally -- we get reads on these very quickly. Like I said, we got to read it. We like the results. But again, we've got to see how the rest of this quarter shapes up from -- it's more of the macro factors versus kind of internally. So I would stay tuned on that. I think we'll probably have an update on that in the -- on the Analyst Day in May. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So I'm going to -- I've got a couple of questions on merging together. First off, just with regard to -- Bill, you talked about the business into -- I guess, into the fiscal Q1 or March. Can you help size better just that sales reacceleration, particularly against the -- I guess, you thought it was on kind of a mid-single-digit used car unit increase in February until the weather hit. And then the second question I have, a bit just unrelated. But with regard to the renegotiation of the fees in the finance business, those of us who watch CarMax for a long time, we've talked about this before a long time. Why now? I mean why -- what allowed you to -- you as a company to make this shift at this point? William Nash : Great, Brian. I'll let John talk about the CAF in just a moment. I can't believe it's taking us like 5 or 6 questions for somebody to actually ask about the sales performance, but I appreciate you asking. Look, if I think about March, as I said in the opening remarks, it's robust. And actually, it's a great -- March has been a great month for us. It's been a record month for us. We've sold more than 100,000 cars in the month of March for the first time in the company's history.  And I would tell you, it doesn't really make sense to think about comps this year versus last year just because of the COVID impact. The way I think about them is we should really be comparing them to March of 2019, so 2 years ago.  March of 2019 was the old record of number of vehicles that we sold. And what I'm most encouraged about is if I compare our March performance this year to 2 years ago, we're seeing double-digit growth on top of that March, which just really speaks to a lot of the things that are going on.  I mean, sure, some of what's going on are macro factors beyond our control. When you think about the pushing of the tax -- some of the tax refund money into March, you think about the stimulus, I absolutely get that, and that's helping drive some of that tailwind. But we're really excited about the tailwind beyond that. So we're -- as we said in our opening remarks, we're excited about 2021. I think the quarter -- I'm sorry, 2022 -- FY 2022. The quarter, unfortunately, it's just -- it's the ending of a very volatile year for us.  I would just remind everyone. If you go back to FY '20, it was a great year, double-digit top line growth, high mid-single-digit comp growth. We continue that into the beginning of FY '21, up until the point we hit the pandemic. And then since the pandemic has been in place, it's obviously been a very volatile year.  Looking at the fourth quarter, the pandemic also started -- caused some of the volatility at the beginning of the quarter with December. And we talked about that in the last call, we had a big surge in COVID cases. And we had a bunch of markets that went back into lockdown mode.  I'll give you one example. The state of California, which has been typically one of the most restrictive states, limiting occupancy to 20% and 25%, that went back into that mode of 20%, 25% in December. A market like that, what we saw is that occupancy restriction causes that market to perform on average north of 10% worse than the rest of the organization.  So we had that headwind on the occupancy restrictions in December and in January. Both of those 2 months, we had more than 50 stores that were less than 50% occupancy, and that -- less than 50% is difficult for us. You get to 50% above, we can work through that. But just given the traffic that comes into our store, it's hard to manage that.  But that being said, we started out December, negative 4. We're able to do better than that at the end of December. We were still negative. But then coming into January, and if I look at January, it was the most normal, if there is such thing, normal month.  We didn't have tax refund delays. We didn't have bad weather. What we really had to contend with were these occupancy restrictions. And even with the occupancy restrictions, we were seeing comps north of 7% in January, which we feel great about. And I really do think that's continuing some of the trends that we saw in the prior year and our investments coming forward.  Then we get into February, clipping along, and like I said in the opening remarks, we were looking -- even though we started down the hall, we were looking at a mid-single-digit comp, excluding the impact of Leap Day. Now keep in mind, Leap Day last year was a Saturday, and our stores are at the busiest day of the week.  So excluding that, we were at mid-single-digit comp, and then we hit the weather constraints and just the delay of the tax refunds. I think, in February, returns were down about 30% year-over-year. So that's a little bit more color on that. Let me pass it to Jon to talk about the other questions. Jon Daniels : Sure. Brian, thanks for your question on the piece. So your question was why now. And a fair question. I think, really, three things I'd point to there versus I think it's just a very favorable lending environment right now. I think customers are performing well, and I think those finance companies and lenders are anxious to extend money out to customers that are performing well.  It's absolutely a favorable funding environment. That's very clear. So those 2 things certainly made it easier. And I think all of our lenders in our platform are really excited about CarMax's growth. So they're excited about what's coming in the future. They love CarMax collateral. So all those things together, I just made it feel like it was the right time. I think some might want to drive home, though, as we think about fees or our entire platform, whether it be the fees and discounts, the partners that we have in the platform, where CAF participates in the platform, the most important thing we're looking to deliver from our finance platform is highly competitive offers across the credit spectrum in all economic environments. And we want to do that such that we can scale that as CarMax scales.  So we're always going to look at that platform and look to optimize it. It felt the right time to make the fee changes now, but we were very careful and looked at what the impact of sales were there. And if we make any changes in the future, we will stay very focused on providing those strong credit offers. So that's the most important to us. William Nash : Brian, one more thing, too. I just want to point out. I talked about the occupancy restrictions. I'm going to knock on wood. But as of right now, although we have about 1/3 of our stores still on occupancy restrictions, the key factor is we only have one store at this point that's less than that 50%. And again, that's an important threshold for us. Brian Nagel : Got it. I appreciate all the color. So Bill, just to clarify. So the month of March, you sold 100,000 cars, if I heard that right, and that's up double digits from -- you're saying that's up double digits from what the number was for '19. William Nash : That's correct. And I think that's the way we should all be thinking about this year. I think, trying to relate comps this year versus last year, I think that's a -- I just don't think that's a good exercise. I think we should relate it back to '19, which was a great year for us, and we sold a lot of cars. And so that's what's really encouraging is that if you look at -- because that March of '19 was the past record, and we beat that by double digits. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Ciccarelli : Well, just can I verify the double-digit you just referenced on Brian's question? Is that comp? Or is that total that includes new stores? William Nash : That is both. It's both. It's comp and total. Robert Ciccarelli : Got it. Helpful. So especially since you are trying to help everyone understand kind of like the sales pace and variances, et cetera, can you provide any more details on what you're seeing in the Atlanta market from a market share sales perspective just given the seasoning in your omnichannel offering?  And kind of related to that, is there anything unique that you're doing in that market? Because at one point, I know there were some unusual things you're doing with marketing and pricing that you hadn't rolled out everywhere. Or is everything kind of a blanket offer -- a blanket testing at this point? William Nash : Yes. So Scot, on the Atlanta, as I said in the opening remarks, the -- we actually maintained the market share in Atlanta. And if I look at the fourth quarter, comps in Atlanta were actually about 6.5%. So we -- again, we're encouraged by that.  And look, we have some older waves that we've rolled out omni that also had comps in the quarter, but then you also -- it gets hard to look at the waves because the waves had some stores that were impacted by weather, some that weren't. So again, Atlanta is kind of the clean look at it. As far as different things, when we started doing the expanded pricing test and looking at the marketing, a lot of that was from the learnings that we had in Atlanta. So we're starting to -- obviously, we've started to put that out in other markets.  I think the other thing to remember is when we roll new things out, so for example, if you think about self-serve, the first market we put that in is Atlanta. Generally, we roll things there first. So they're always getting things a little bit earlier than everyone else. So that would be the other -- the difference that I would point to as well.  But on the self-serve, again, I just -- we're excited about that because I think the team has done a tremendous amount of work. We -- coming out of the second quarter, we've got 25% of our customers were available to use it. And we think that most of the customers by the end of the second quarter will have that option. Robert Ciccarelli : That's helpful. And just one more follow-up, if I can. Is there any demographic differences for people utilizing the omnichannel than what your typical customer cohort would be? William Nash : Yes. No, it's interesting. We don't really see any big shift in demographics. It's -- it very much mirrors the typical CarMax customer that would come into the store. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask, if I could, where the self-sufficiency ratio was for fiscal fourth quarter and then for the prior year. And then I had a quick follow-up for that. William Nash : Yes. So Michael, the self-sufficiency for the quarter was around -- it was a little bit above 40%, 41-ish percent, and that's up from the prior year's fourth quarter, where it was down in the 30s, mid- to -- really kind of mid-30s, around 35% or so. Michael Montani : Okay. And then the follow-up I had was just to get some sense of magnitude on the potential tailwind to GPUs from self-sufficiency. I've been thinking of it as maybe $600 to $1,000 a unit, all else equal. And I guess, I wouldn't insinuate that you all would flow all of that through, but it just seems like if GPU is still going to be down, even with that kind of a tailwind, it suggests that you're getting really sharp on price and doing a lot of free transfers. So just wanted to understand how you think about striking that competitive balance as well. William Nash : Yes. I mean, I think you bring up a good point. I mean, the more we can buy through the appraisal lane, it obviously is -- it's better from a profitability standpoint. If you think about it, you're not paying auction fees in a lot of cases. In all the cases right now, we don't -- we're not having to transport them from an auction. They're actually at the store.  So we take that's part of how we manage our overall margin. And at times, we'll take some of those synergies, and we'll obviously pass along in prices, which would be really hard for you guys to see. Other times, obviously, we have the option to manage our margin and get to the margin where we want to be. So it's a balancing act, and it's one that we'll continue to take into consideration as well as continuing to look at the macro factors as we go forward on our pricing test. Operator : Your next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Rajat Gupta : Just to follow up on like the 100,000 number for March. Maybe talk about some stimulus and tax refunds shift, maybe some recovery from the poor weather in Texas, some deferred purchases because of that. Like is there any way to quantify how many of those 100,000 units may have been a shift from Feb to March as you have seen in any other normal year? And just like just -- could you give us a sense of the mix of alternate delivery channel volumes in the fourth quarter and in March as well? And I have just one more follow-up. William Nash : Okay. Rajat, so as far as the sales shift, really, it's hard to quantify, especially break it down between the weather and the delay in tax refunds. I think the best way to think about that is kind of how I talked about it earlier that, coming into February, middle of February, we would have -- excluding the impact of the Leap Day, we would have been running about a mid-single-digit comp. And obviously, that's not where we ended up. So that's one way to think about.  We ended up at negative 2, 3. That's one way to think about the weather and the taxes combined, but it's really hard to parse out. And it's hard to know exactly, obviously, how much is impacted.  So as far as the alternative delivery, just to remind everybody, alternative delivery is both home delivery, but it's also express pickup or curbside pickup. That's still -- we're seeing still -- it's under 10% of overall delivery. And again, that's a number, while we have reported out on it, it's one that -- it's not like we're trying to drive that. Again, this is all about giving the customer the experience they want. If they want home delivery, great. If they want to pick it up in the store, great. So -- but to answer your question, it's about -- it's under 10% of the overall.  I think the other thing, Rajat, is the thing that I introduced, which is the online sales. That's kind of a new way, a new metric that we're -- we talked about on this call. And obviously, in May, we'll have more on these metrics. But 5% of our customers essentially did the whole transaction online. And then to us, we don't care how they get it fulfilled, whether it's in the store or if it's at-home. And we expect that 5% to continue to go up. Rajat Gupta : Got it. And so just on a previous question, like have you been able to gauge any impact from the stimulus package separately that might have helped March? Or any sense of that? Like what kind of contribution that might have had to your growth in March? William Nash : Yes. So I mean, obviously, it's having an impact. Again, it's like the weather and the tax delay refund. It's hard to gauge. But I think the thing that we're excited about is you've got different ranges, and it's not an exact science.  But we just feel like the increase that we're seeing is beyond the stimulus. It's beyond the weather rollover. It's beyond the delay in tax refunds. And it really speaks to all the investments that we've been making on so many different fronts. And that's what we're excited about. Rajat Gupta : Got it, got it. That's helpful. And then just on the SG&A line, you talked about increased investment. The overhead cost bucket moved higher sequentially. Our understanding, based on some comments on like previous earnings calls, were like there were some permanent reductions that took place there. So just curious on how we should think about that line item specifically going into fiscal 2022 and beyond. What kind of investments are going on there? Like how much is fixed versus variables, et cetera? Just any color on that would be really helpful. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. The way we think about it now is absolutely the right time to invest in growing our business, and that's the path forward that we've been taking. The industry and CarMax, we're at an inflection point, so we believe investment is the right point in time is now.  I think it's also important to recognize that the investments we're making are also impacting our appraisal and our wholesale business, which we have focused some of our investments on, and we'll be talking about that in the upcoming Analyst Day. We'll speak to think -- we'll speak to how we think about SG&A in light of these investments at a really growing multiple components of our business, not just our used unit business.  I would look specifically. To answer your question, the other line in SG&A. That actually is where you'll find some of our strategic investments, and we expect that line will go up. It has been offset over the past year and will continue to be offset by efficiency gains that we have across the business and that we're always focused on, but that line item specifically tags to our strategic investments as well around technology. William Nash : And Rajat, the only other thing that I would add to that is if all we were focused on this year was continuing our -- improving our omnichannel experience, you would have seen a cost of -- a bend in the cost curve from an SG&A standpoint. But to Enrique's point, now is the time to continue to invest, and we're investing in all different parts of the business. So -- which is also why Enrique said, you got to look at the kind of the two year 5% to 8% in order to lever. So I just wanted to add that as well. Rajat Gupta : Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I could just squeeze in one more on the Edmunds. You talked about like neutral from an accretion standpoint, including like the financing and the equity, I guess. Any way to think about like just like gross profit or like EBIT contribution from the deal? Will you be reporting that? When will that go in effectively? Or will it just be a separate line item or something? Just any color on that would be helpful. That's all. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. We do anticipate that we'll be reporting Edmunds as an operating segment, so you'll have a view into, certainly, the revenue, which we announced today, what their last year's revenue was as well as profitability. What I'd tell you, though, is if you take a step back from an impact accretiveness, dilution impact upon the transaction, it's really immaterial to CarMax in the immediacy. What I'd tell you is that we expect to create a significant amount of shareholder value creation from the acquisition, and we expect that to start in fairly short order as well.  We have been partnering with Edmunds and the great people there for over the past year at this point, so we are really familiar with what benefits we can both accrue from our relationship. And we decided to exercise our option and pull the full acquisition, largely because we've seen the benefits over the past year of our partnerships. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Nels Nelson : Like supply constraints are pretty low document. It's on the new car side. I'm curious how you see that impacting your business. And any view as to when you think new car supplies will normalize and how that might impact when they hit? William Nash : Yes. Rick, it's hard to know when the new car supply is going to continue to ramp up. I mean, they're obviously facing some major chip shortage. I think the supply -- the tightening of the supply is going to be around here for a while.  That being said, I go back to some of my earlier comments, which is we source a lot of vehicles through our appraisal lane. And the more that we do that, the better it is for the organization. So we don't rely on the wholesale supply for all of our inventory, which -- I feel like there's plenty of supply out there. You've got to work a little bit harder, but I would add on top of that is because we're buying so much to the appraisal lane, it doesn't really have that much of an impact on our business, other than it could cause the overall sales price -- the average sales price to go up for everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Exane BNP Paribas. Chris Bottiglieri : So first one, I want to follow up on the Tier 2, Tier 3. Congrats on getting that lower Tier 3 fee. Never made sense in the first place. But once we exit this bizarre credit world that we're in, where losses are lower, right, but higher unemployment, if things go back to kind of pre-COVID trends. Do you expect the change in fee structure to stick? Is this permanent? Or is this like -- that is the piece that what I want to understand, whether it's environment-driven or like, moving forward in perpetuity, will that $750 stay? William Nash : Yes. I mean, thanks for the question, Chris. It's hard to say if it's going to stick. This is very fluid environment. We're always looking to optimize the platform clearly. Clearly, it's a very positive credit environment in which we're operating right now, but I think our lenders are in this for the long haul. They see the growth potential there. So we will work with them carefully and assess if the fee structure is correct. We don't expect it to whipsaw back and forth quarter after quarter, but we will keep a careful eye on it.  Again, one thing I want to drive home is, again, our structures with our partners, we have many partners in place. They provide the quality offers that we are able to give our customers in all the economic times, bizarre economic times and good times as well. So they have been critical to the success that we have had over the years, including the Tier 3 space, where we believe that is truly an incremental sale.  So we value them. We work very carefully with them to make sure that everybody is winning in this platform, and we're poised for growth. So we feel real good about our platform right now. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That's really helpful. And then my next question is on the allowance. Obviously, a lot of noise this year because the loss environment we spoke about a second ago and then CECL implementation. So can you kind of help frame for us like how to think about the allowance?  Like let's just say the world goes back to normal, credit losses normalize, CECL is still intact. Like what's your allowance look like given the profile of the risk characteristics you're looking at today? Like what's a normalized allowance for a kind of normal cycle? Like what should that number look like? It's been just hard to forecast, frankly. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes. So the metric that I'll point you to, again, is that reserve divided by receivables, it's 2.97% for this quarter. Remember, coming down from 3.17% the previous quarter. Remember, also in that metric is the Tier 1 allowance, the Tier 3 allowance and the required recovery expense for CECL.  So I would say we're still north of what we consider normal times. We've always quoted 2% to 2.5% for the Tier 1 business. Obviously, again, you get that Tier 3 in the recovery in there. But we're still north of it. And I would point you that 2% to 2.5% for Tier 1 business is probably where we would expect to revert back to when things go back to normal. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session as we have reached 10 :00 a.m. Those who are waiting in queue can reach out to Investor Relations to have the questions answered. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks. William Nash : Thank you, Carol. Look, we've covered a lot today. A few takeaways. One, we feel great about the trajectory of the business and the outlook for fiscal 2022. We think that the past investments, our current investments, our ability to quickly innovate, innovate on things like the online appraisal, innovate on things like self-serve, that it will create an omnichannel experience and a value proposition that's really unrivaled in the car industry and will allow us to capture an increased market share.  We're excited about the Edmunds acquisition and working with that talented team to make both companies stronger. And finally, I look forward to our Analyst Day on May 6 to dive a little bit deeper into the business and discuss new metrics and share how we're thinking about the future.  I also just want to take a moment to thank all of our associates for their contributions. This past year, it was extremely challenging for everyone, and our associates did a remarkable job of not only taking care of each other and the customers, but really helping us to innovate the company forward. And I'm tremendously proud of all their efforts. And I'm proud to work with all of them. And finally, to all of you on the call, we appreciate your continued support at CarMax, and we look forward to talking with you again at our Analyst Day on May 6. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholesale and auto finance and a solid flow-through to EPS. Our success reflects the continued progress we are making in our digital transformation and online experience, along with solid execution and our ongoing commitment to disciplined cost management. In addition, we benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments. For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138% compared with the first quarter of FY '21 and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a year ago. This also represents increases of 43% and 65%, respectively, from the previous record set in the first quarter of FY '20. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first quarter last year and a 31% increase on a two-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. We also bought 236% more cars in the first quarter of this year versus last year and 77% more compared with two years ago. As many of you know, for the past several years, our priorities in investments have focused on building an unmatched experience with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates seamlessly with our best-in-class in-store experience. The result has been a massive organizational transformation that includes building a comprehensive set of digital and hybrid processes to accommodate our customers in whatever way they want to interact with us. Our progress in executing this strategy has given us a very solid start to FY '22 and we remain confident in our long-term targets announced at our recent Analyst Day of 2 million retail and wholesale combined units sold per year and $33 billion of revenue by FY '26. In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter were up 101% and used unit comps were up 99% versus the first quarter last year. Compared with the first quarter of FY '20, total retail unit sales were up 21% and same-store comps were up 16%. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,205 of retail gross profit per used unit for the quarter, up $268 versus a year ago and in line with the first quarter of FY '20. Given the strong demand environment for used autos and inventory constraints throughout the automotive industry, we pulled back on the expanded pricing test we introduced in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to monitor macro factors and pricing elasticity and we'll adjust our pricing accordingly to maximize unit sales and profitability. For wholesale, our units sold were up 187% compared with last year's first quarter and were up 50% when compared with the first quarter of FY '20. Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $1,025 compared with $978 for the same period last year and was in line with the first quarter of FY '20. The strength in wholesale was primarily driven by the introduction of our instant online appraisal offering, which we rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on edmonds.com last year. We also benefited from significant appreciation of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, continued to deliver solid results with income of $242 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will give you some more details on that coming up here shortly. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance, but we know there are opportunities to be even better. For example, on the operational front, inventory available for sale was below targeted levels throughout the entire first quarter. These lower levels are the result of recent demand and the temporary COVID and weather-impacted production slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter. Remember, the fourth quarter is the time when we are ramping production ahead of the peak demand tax refund season. Our teams have done an amazing job producing inventory in the first quarter, and we expect inventory to continue to increase as we add additional production capacity at existing locations. Now, I'll turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance, and then Jon will share additional detail around customer financing. So Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profits increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by EPP growth of $61 million or 83%, driven primarily by retail sales growth and a stable penetration rate above 60%. Service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales. Relative to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, other gross profit grew $22 million or 18%. This was primarily due to volume-related growth in EPP and the benefit from our renegotiated third-party finance fees, partially offset by service deleverage. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $554 million, up 71% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago. Robust sales in the first quarter, along with disciplined cost management, delivered strong leverage with SG&A as a percent of gross profit of 59.9%, down from 91. 7% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by a $108 million increase in compensation and benefits, which was primarily the result of comping over COVID-related payroll reductions last year, along with an increase in variable costs due to higher volume and in headcount as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising expense driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omni-channel offerings and drive customer acquisition. This year's increase was also impacted by reductions in last year's spend due to the pandemic. Marketing leveraged by 1.9 percentage points versus last year and a $79 million increase in other overhead due to comparing against the $40 million Takata settlement benefit recognized in last year's quarter. Our continued investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and comping over pandemic-related reductions last year. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. For example, our CECs are a significant differentiator for us and an area of opportunity. In the first quarter, our CECs continued their year-over-year gains in efficiency and effectiveness through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing that ensures customers get the right support. We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used auto ecosystem. We recognize that we have an opportunity to capitalize on our leadership position to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our approach to capital allocation is aligned with this belief and is supported by the significant amount of cash our diversified business model generates. First, we continue to focus on our core business by aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omni-channel experience, vehicle and customer acquisition, and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. Of particular note this quarter was the very strong ROI we are experiencing in vehicle acquisition, primarily through our instant online appraisal offerings. Second, we will deploy capital to pursue new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships and acquisitions. On June 1, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. We are confident this transaction will create significant shareholder value over time. Additionally, of note on the P&L this quarter, other income increased $29 million when compared with the same period last year primarily due to a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. As we've noted in the past, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem. Finally, we will continue to return excess capital back to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $125 million. We have $1.21 billion remaining in current authorizations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, the finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of free-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used unit sales compared with 28.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 10% compared with 14.5% a year ago. You will recall in the first quarter of FY '21, at the beginning of the pandemic, we leveraged our long-term relationships and routed a portion of CAF's Tier 1 volume and all of the allocated Tier 3 volume to our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners, which explains much of this year-over-year shift in tier mix. Note, this was done as a temporary measure, which limited CAF's origination volume while preserving the high quality of the portfolio. By the end of the second quarter last year, we've returned to our normal routing procedures. During this first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was $2.5 billion, marking the largest single origination quarter in CAF's history and the first quarter above $2 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.9% versus 5.9% in the same period last year as the strength of our ABS program continues to yield significant benefits in the form of lower funding costs. CAF income for the quarter was $242 million, up from $51 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of a substantial improvement in the required provision for loan losses, stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. Total interest margin in the quarter increased by $47 million or 24%, driven by the growth in originations and lower cost of funds. With respect to our provision for loan losses, in the first quarter, we experienced $7.2 million in net credit loss or 21 basis points of average managed receivables. As a percentage of the portfolio, this is the lowest reported loss we have experienced in over 20 years. The resulting favorability versus our expectations, coupled with the corresponding adjustment in our outlook for future losses, resulted in $24 million of income related to the provision in the first quarter. This is compared to a $122 million provision expense in the same period last year. This release of reserves resulted in an ending reserve balance of $380 million for the first quarter or 2.62% of managed receivables, which is a decrease from the 2.97% and at the end of the fourth quarter. Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has continued to trend downward towards more historical levels as our customers remain persistent in their willingness and ability to make their auto payment despite the uncertain environment. We believe this current adjustment effectively captures the positive loss performance we have seen over the past four quarters and is appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment. Finally, as previously mentioned, CAF increased its percent of Tier 3 volume to 10% by the end of the first quarter. This adjustment had a minimal impact on the reserve within the quarter, but as the higher volume continues to flow into the portfolio over subsequent quarters, we expect income and the provision to increase accordingly. With regard to where CAF will participate in the credit spectrum in the future, as always, we will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments if and when we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I said at our Analyst Day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our multiyear investment in omni-channel experience has further enhanced our offering, which is the most customer-centric experience within the used auto industry. We are agnostic about how our customers shop and buy because we are positioned to give every customer a world-class buying experience regardless of how they shop with us. In turn, this gives us access to the largest addressable market within the states. In the first quarter, approximately 8% of our retail unit sales were online. As a reminder, when a customer completes all four of the major transactional activities remotely, so that's reserving the vehicle; financing the vehicle, if that's needed, trading in or opting out of a trade-in; and creating a sales order. We consider this an online retail sale. Because all our wholesale auctions were made virtual this quarter, 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. As a result, total revenue coming from online transactions was 24% in the first quarter. Omni sales represented approximately 56% of retail unit sales, up from 51% last quarter. As a reminder, omni sales or retail sales where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely, while all of our customers can buy a car online with assistance, we have been focused on providing a 100% self-service experience. Today, 40% of our retail customers can independently complete an online sale, up from 25% at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to have this capability available to most customers by the end of the second quarter. We continue to leverage digital innovations to drive growth with our online instant appraisal offerings where customers can receive an online offer on their car in less than two minutes and have payment in hand the same day. In the first quarter, we bought approximately 163,000 vehicles through these online offerings, which represent 48% of our total buys from consumers. And since rolling out nationwide at the end of last quarter, we believe we have become the largest online buyer of used audits from the consumers in the U.S. This is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently source vehicles, especially during periods of high demand, enabling us to remain competitively priced while producing attractive GPUs. On the retail side, we're making our online experience faster by improving our finance approval and flow process. We're making it easier by enabling customers to request card transfers and then manage and track them all online. And we're empowering our customers by providing them with financing information across our entire inventory as the first step in their shopping journey. This gives our customers greater confidence they can afford the vehicle they select. As we expand access and further enhance digital aspects of our experience, we need to reinforce awareness of CarMax's new capabilities and their values to customers. Since launching our new brand campaign and Love Your Car Guarantee offerings at the end of last year, we've seen strong growth in the awareness of our omni-channel experience with both web traffic and Google search volumes continuing to increase. As digital adoption by consumers and dealers continues to grow, we'll keep building on our investments in omni, our proprietary technology stack and our strong brand reputation to maximize growth in our core businesses. We're also pursuing additional growth opportunities in the broader trillion-dollar-plus used auto ecosystem that leverage our capabilities and strength in the industry. As Enrique mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Edmunds, one of the most well-established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations. Edmunds brings us closer to a broader set of consumers and brings us closer to dealers. Our teams are super excited and are continuing to collaborate on new products that will support Edmunds dealers partners and consumers. We see tremendous opportunity and we'll provide updates as we launch new offerings more broadly. In summary, this was truly an exceptional quarter, and we are absolutely excited for the future. Our results reflect strong and disciplined execution across our diversified business model and further validate our strategies to enable sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value creation. We remain focused on enhancing our online capabilities to deliver the most customer-centric offering in the market. We will continue to accelerate our growth and market share gains while also laying the groundwork for future initiatives and growth opportunities. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Shelby? Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question is from Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the wholesale momentum. My question goes to the GPU. Did you mention that you pulled back on the GPU experiment in the hot market? Will you go back to experimentation once the market normalizes? Bill Nash : Yes, great question. So yes, we did suspend it. And if you remember last quarter, in the fourth quarter, I talked about we're going to continue to be monitoring those macro factors. And as we monitor the macro factors, especially like the inventory constraints and the elasticity, it didn't make sense to continue to do that. As I said in my opening remarks, we will continue to monitor those macro factors, and we're very open to continuing to do some different things with pricing. I would tell you like right now, I probably would say we wouldn't do it, but we'll reserve the right just as the quarter progresses. But either way, we'll be able to provide great GPUs above $2,000. Operator : Your next question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about what your customer sourcing ratio was in terms of the retail business for the quarter? And then as you're looking at the online purchases, which obviously have ramped really quickly, how are those -- how is the GPU on the online appraisals kind of comparing to the in-person appraisals? Are you seeing those kind of be relatively similar? Or is there a variance that can narrow over time? Bill Nash : Great question. So when I think about the total buys that we bought from consumers, it's about a 50-50 split between retail and wholesale. And that's both as you think about traditionally customers coming into the store and doing the appraisal, but that also is very similar to the online purchases. As far as the productivity of the online purchase versus the traditional in-store appraisals, they're both great and they're very similar, which again, is a huge benefit as we think about inventory sourcing and being able to manage GPUs, pricing, that kind of thing. Operator : Your next question is from John Murphy of Bank of America. John Murphy : Just maybe a follow-up actually on the question of supply build. I mean you bought 341,000 vehicles from the consumers in the quarter. I mean that's as much -- I think you had one quarter in history of 345,000 in total vehicles. So I mean you bought almost as many vehicles as you ever peaked out on selling. So I'm just curious what's going on there on your ability to buy directly from the consumer? And then also, if you think on the supply side, both from the consumer and then even at auctions, when do you think supply more naturally eases up? I mean, there's crazy things going on like Davis and Hertz buying cars and auctions and traditionally, they're sources and sellers, right? So I mean there's some wacky stuff going on in the supply side. How much wood can you chomp on buying from consumers? How important is that going to be going forward? And then when does supply, which is totally wacky at the moment, normalize on the flow and supply? Bill Nash : Yes. So John, obviously, the buying directly from consumers has been a big focus. I've talked about us putting investments in that area. And I think what you're seeing is it really coming to fruition. I mean you think about it, more than 340,000 cars that we bought from consumers, it's up 236%. It's up 77% versus FY '20. It's just truly remarkable. A big piece of that, obviously, is just having easier access to consumer with our online offering. But we're also encouraged just by the traditional with new customers coming into the store and doing appraisals that way. So, we feel good about both of those. The supply piece is interesting. There's some abnormal things that you mentioned there. But I'll go back to what I said in the fourth quarter, supply has not been an issue for us. While our saleable inventory is certainly lower than where we want it to be right now, the supply, if you look at total inventory, we're very much in line with where we were in FY '20. It's really more a matter of production. And I think with the online offering in addition to the traditional appraisal lane that also just diminishes our need for external supply going through those other sources. And more general to your question of how long -- absolutely, there's some supply constraints out there because you've got some different folks doing different things. You also have the demand for maybe some new car customers moving into used cars. I think it will -- time will tell. I think the new car isn't going to work itself out in the next quarter or two, I think we're probably looking more towards the latter part of the year. So, I don't see a lot changing in supply over the next couple of quarters. But again, the supply is not an issue, there's still a lot of cars that are changing hands out there. You may -- if you're buying off site, you have to work a little bit harder. But we feel great about where we are from a total inventory standpoint. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, John, what I would say is the 163,000 cars that we bought through our instant online offers really exceeded our expectations. That has been extremely well received by customers. And I think it's a really good example of the investments we've been making in innovation to make sure we're at the forefront of the consumer's mind. And again, that's 163,000 cars through our online offer. And really, we just stood up that product a quarter ago. So, we're really, really pleased with that performance. John Murphy : Can that ever significantly drive the consumer source vehicles way above 50%? I mean, is that the direction you're heading? I'm just curious what that target might be. Bill Nash : Yes. Look, we want to drive that target as high as possible. We've historically -- the last several years, we've been in this range of 35% to 45%. We're already above that range for this quarter. We're between 45% and 50% for this quarter. And I think, again, our goal is to drive that as high as possible. And what we're seeing, we're very, very encouraged by that. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Montani of Evercore. Michael Montani : I wanted to ask about any thoughts you all may have on the pricing environment, both in terms of the wholesale side as well as the retail side? And what you might be seeing recently in our discussions with Manheim? It sounds like they might have just seen an inflection point where the pricing is at least starting to moderate. So I'd just love to get some incremental thoughts that you all may have. And then secondly, what does that mean for the business if we do see some moderation, what does that mean for retail and wholesale? Bill Nash : Yes. Good morning, Michael, yes, it's a great question. You've been following us long enough to know that this pricing environment is really -- it's really unprecedented. If you think about from January until now, the $5,000 to $6,000 worth of appreciation that we've seen, it's truly remarkable. Our average selling prices were up a couple of thousand dollars. From an acquisition standpoint, they're actually up a little bit more than that, but it was a little bit offset based off of mix and age. I do think we're reaching an inflection point. If you look at the consumer price index and the difference between new cars and late-model used cars, that gap has definitely narrowed. While new cars are going up, they have not gone up at the pace of used cars. And that's fairly self-correct and get to a point where, okay, its late model used cars is bumping up against the new car. And I think we are getting close to that inflection point. And I think that's I think great because obviously, when the gap narrows, it's a headwind for used car purchases. When the gap widens, the gap between used and new, that's a great thing for used car sales. So I think that's a positive thing. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Nice quarter, congratulations. So my question is very much a follow-up to that prior question, just with regard to pricing, Bill. I mean we've all talked -- we've all heard right about this unprecedented, if you will, price environment used cars. So I guess the question I have is as we look at these results in the various facets across the business, was the pricing environment a tailwind or headwind for CarMax? And then again, this is again a follow-up up. And how should we think about this going forward as we look towards the balance of the year? Bill Nash : Yes. Normally, that pricing environment would be a headwind to just the used car industry in general. I think the difference this quarter was that because there was a lack of new car availability, I think it pushed customers down into the used car market, which helped to raise the price of used cars. So it's really -- it's hard to kind of pull that apart. There's a lot of different factors going on there because you've got now new customers coming in there. You have the stimulus out there that's driving up demand. So, I think the normal -- what you would normally see from really high price increases on used cars, it's hard. I don't think it was the same -- it had the same elasticity effect that you would normally see. Now I think going forward, not having some of that stimulus out there, I think the normal elasticity and pricing, I think, will start to return. And I think back to Michael's point, if we've seen this inflection point starts to go down, I think that's a good thing. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think the other thing as well is that the diversity of our business model really allows us to perform in any kind of environment. So while pricing may be a headwind in some sense, it's a tailwind to other parts of our business. And you see that in our results, and you see that kind of from quarter-to-quarter in our results just that diversity that is unparalleled in the industry. Bill Nash : Yes. And I think the other thing at play here is, look, we've been doing this long enough that whether you see rapid appreciation or rapid depreciation. I think the way that we manage our inventory, how we buy the data that we leverage and the technology that we leverage, I think it's certainly a competitive advantage. Operator : Your next question is from Rick Nelson of Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks. So, we saw the reserve reversal this quarter, allowance now at 2.62% of receivables. Historically, I believe that number has been more in the 2% to 2.5% range for Tier 1. I guess how should we think about that allowance account and potential for more reversals? Bill Nash : Yes. Appreciate the question, Rick. Yes, right on the mark, 2.62% is our reserve as a percentage of receivables right now. And correct. Historically, we have sustained at the 2% to 2.5% is our targeted range for our Tier 1 portfolio. Now bear in mind that 2.62% incorporates both Tier 1 and Tier 3 included in there. So if you were to back that out, you can see that we really are in the operating range that we've previously stated. And we've trended downward nicely since that. I think it's a pretty substantial move we've made since the end of Q4 to now. And obviously, that's a reflection of the great performance that we saw in the quarter. So going forward, we think 2.62% is a really solid number for us across both the Tier 1 and Tier 3 portfolio, and we'll see how the customer performs in the future. Operator : Your next question is from John Healy of Northcoast. John Healy : I wanted to ask a little bit about the SG&A levels. I know you've talked about variety of investments. And clearly, those are paying off right now. But I wanted to get your view on kind of the traditional ad campaigns that you've launched? I know you've done the things with the NBA and some new television and I think radio ads. How do you feel about that spend? Is it still as effective as it once was? Are you happy with it right now? And do you see that continuing to be a big part of the SG&A as we go into next year? Or maybe should expect some recalibration on that front? Bill Nash : Yes, John. So let me talk first just about the productivity of the ad spend. First of all, we're thrilled with it. If you look at the advertising spend for the quarter, it's actually below the guidance we've kind of given for this year. And I would just think about that as that's just a timing. We're committed to continuing to advertise in a thoughtful ROI way. I would tell you, looking at what we've been doing, we had a record hit. Our average number of hits to our website for this quarter was 34.5 million, which is up significantly from any prior record. which is up significantly We're seeing web visits up roughly 60% year-over-year, 40% if you compare back to FY '20. Google searches are up double digits. So we feel very, very good about the new programs that we're doing and how we're really kind of going out there and spreading the omni-channel experience to consumers. But I'll tell you, this isn't -- it's not a one quarter thing. We need to continue to be at this, and we're committed to continue to spend. And Enrique, I don't know if you have any other thoughts as it relates to the SG&A. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, absolutely. If you take a look at advertising, we communicated last quarter and in our Analyst Day, we intend on spending more. And what we said was, we're going to spend this year on a per unit basis, pretty much what we spent in the back half of last year, which was a ramp-up in expense. And so if you take a look at that and you compare it to two years ago, in FY '20, certainly a more normalized year. We're looking at an increase of over 40% on a per unit basis in our advertising costs, which is consistent with what we've communicated. But just to give you some context and perspective on how we think of the importance and more importantly, of the returns that we're getting from our advertising spend. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Rajat Gupta of JPMorgan. Rajat Gupta : Congrats on the strong sprint. I just had a question on -- you mentioned earlier about how the pricing is reaching a level where it's probably starting to maybe impact demand to some extent. Could you give us some color on like how the progression was through the quarter, like this March, April, May on the pound versus 2019 level? Then if you could give us any color on how the first three or four weeks of June have trended there, that would be helpful. Bill Nash : Yes, Rajat. So, we're pleased with the whole entire quarter. I mean when we talk about looking back to FY '20, don't forget the first quarter in FY '20 was a 9.5% comp and we're comping 16% on top of that. And we saw strong growth in every month of the quarter. And I've talked about it on the last call how March was a new record month for us. April was also a record month as it relates to April. May was also a record month as it relates to May. So we're very pleased with the strong performance throughout there. And we're very pleased with the performance as we enter into the new quarter. I'll tell you, I'll be excited to get to the second quarter because if you remember last year, we had a positive comp in the second quarter. And I'm going to knock on wood that we don't have to keep talking back to FY '20 because it's a lot of numbers to remember. But we'll certainly at the end of the second quarter talk more about that quarter, but we feel great how the quarter started. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. So given the dynamics that we're seeing in the used vehicle market, obviously, the category is very hot, and you were more aggressive posture in vehicle purchasing activity. Can you shorten your reconditioning process further to improve throughput or maybe add more day capacity? Because, Bill, when I'm listening to you, it sounds like your own production capabilities may have limited some of your inventory offerings, and thus, your sales performance. Bill Nash : Yes. No, Scot, you're absolutely right. I mean our inventory level right now, is I think -- obviously, we're below target the whole quarter, we're probably 40% lower than where we would like to be. And in a normal environment, if you have that much less inventory, it certainly is a headwind. I think it was a headwind. I don't think it was to the normal elasticity that you would see just given what was going on in the rest of the marketplace. But it really is about production. And we normally build ahead of time to get ready. We weren't able to do that. Our operations team is doing a phenomenal job. We're adding additional capacity in those existing facility. So I would expect that to continue to go up. One of the areas I've talked about from an efficiency standpoint in the past, as we look to take way side of the system, one of the areas that we've been focused on is our flow production. And we've actually now finished rolling out kind of the next version of that. And we would expect to get more throughput through existing facilities and resources. So we're excited about that, and that will continue to help us. And then, of course, to meet our long-term goals, we'll be adding additional capacity as we go forward. But yes, I think it's absolutely fair to say that the inventory was a headwind for us. And it's not the supply side. It's more of the production side. And again, I can't give enough shout-out to our operations team because not only have they been meeting that demand, but they're building on it. And if you watch your inventory recently, you've seen that we're starting to ramp it back up. Scot Ciccarelli : So how long does it take to recondition, let's call it, an average car today? And where could that potentially go? Like can you knock off a significant amount of time? Or you just kind of you're pretty close to where you're optimized. Bill Nash : No, I think we can optimize more to say traditional car. Remember, it also depends on the mix of vehicles. Your older vehicles take a little bit longer than your newer vehicles. I think we're probably -- if I think about the whole -- what you're really asking about is cycle time. Cycle time, and keep in mind, that's the time that the car is ready to be worked on. You got to wait for parts and all that kind of stuff. You think about that cycle time, it's probably -- it's somewhere in between the 5 and 10 days, and that depends on the vehicle. Now certainly, some vehicles take a lot less than that. And we have obviously phases in our production that are we measure by minutes. But I do think this is an area of opportunity. I think this is one that we're already, with our new flow production system. I think we're already starting to realize more throughput, which is great. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Bottiglieri of Exane BNP Paribas. Chris Bottiglieri : Thank you for taking the question. Strong quarter. I had a quick question on the GPU. So, it sounds like you pulled back on the price investments, the customer sourcing mix is as high as I've ever seen it. It sounds like used pricing was a tailwind to GPUs. I don't know if that's true or if you can confirm that. But were there any offsets like is it just costing work to recondition cars this environment or like anything that would mitigate some of these tailwinds on GPU that could speak to? Bill Nash : Well, first of all, for us, the used car pricing isn't necessarily a tailwind to GPU. We don't manage our margin according to how expensive a vehicle is. We have a lot of other factors. So that's not necessarily a tailwind for us like it might be some of the other folks. I think as we look forward, having -- driving higher self-sufficiency is certainly going to be a tailwind for us. And I've always said that we've -- our prices are very competitive. And I'd tell you, I think our prices are as competitive as ever right now. So I feel great about the direction we're going. I feel great about our prices. I feel great about the flexibility that we have to not only provide world-class GPU per car for retail car, but also be able to do it in a way that our prices are very, very competitive. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and god morning. My question is on the mix of sales that were purchased online, 8% this quarter versus 5% last quarter. Is that solely due to the increased eligibility of customers being able to buy entirely online? Or are there other factors? And as you get to 100% rollout of eligibility would you expect that metric to move up closer to 20%? Bill Nash : Yes. So, the 5% to 8% was driven by geographic expansion and some additional capabilities. I would expect that number to continue to go up. As I said, we made some good progress. And actually, I'm sorry, you're asking about the total online, not just the self-serve. So self-serve -- I mean, online went from 25% to 40%. And I would expect that number to continue to go up as we add additional capabilities as we go forward. And the areas that we're focused on, I think primarily, what's going to continue to drive the adoption will be, again, adding some of the self-service features. And so when I think about that, the areas we're focused on is to make it a little bit more simple and seamless on transfers as well as trade-ins. Enrique Mayor-Mora: We certainly expect that percent of sales and percent of revenues from online to go up. But at the same time, the beauty of our business model is that it's really up to the consumer and of omni, right? So to the degree the consumer wants to buy online, they can do that and more and more so. To the degree they want to come into the store and shop that way, they can do that as well. We expect the numbers to go up. But again, it's really going to be driven by the consumers and how they want to interact with us, whether it's in-store or online. Seth Basham : Got it. And the all-in gross profit per unit per vehicle purchased entirely online versus through the stores. How is that comparing these days? Enrique Mayor-Mora: They're about similar, about similar. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : Your final question is from David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Edmunds acquisition, honestly, I'm still not totally clear on the rationale for it. I get there's vertical integration benefits, I think, procuring and retailing. But -- At the same time, there are CarMax competitors that are paying them for their lead generation. So how are you ensuring that they still get a fair shake because otherwise, they're not going to want to do business with Edmunds and a CarMax is getting preferences? Can you just connect some dots for me? Bill Nash : Yes. So again, we're thrilled to complete the acquisition as are the teams on both sides. As a reminder, they are that premium brand for automotive research. We're going to continue to operate them as a separate brand and a separate company. And we're excited to work with them to continue to drive more of the services for their consumers and their dealers and their OEM partners. We're going to invest in their brand, but we're also excited about the teams continuing to collaborate and progress on programs that help both companies and a great example of that is the instant offers. We developed that with them, initially rolled it out on Edmunds, and then we have it on carmax.com. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there with still and we think there's a lot of opportunity on content. So I think it's very important that we keep the Company separate, and we keep making sure that they're continuing to add value to their individual customers. And I think we can do both. And then as we continue to develop things jointly together that benefit both companies, we'll continue to highlight those in the future. David Whiston : Okay. And can you disclose investment was do you have the gain on? Enrique Mayor-Mora: No, we don't really talk about -- we have -- as I mentioned, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem, primarily strategic to make sure that we understand and we know what's going on in that space. And so, we just had an outsized gain this quarter on one of those investments, but we don't really disclose which companies we're investing in. Operator : There are no other questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Shelby. Well, hopefully, you guys can tell from our comments that we're extremely pleased with the first quarter results and that we are very excited about the future. And it's not just about the opportunities that come with having this largest total addressable market in the used auto retail, but it's also the opportunities that exist in our other core businesses. So if you think wholesale, you think CAF, and then even going beyond that into this larger auto ecosystem. And all of it is supported by the tremendous transformation, whether it's our omni-channel experiences, whether it's our proprietary tech stack, it's data or some of the other offerings that we highlighted on today's call. I want to thank you for your questions today. I want to thank you for your continued support; and as always, I want to thank our associates for their continued dedication of living our values, taking care of each other, taking care of our customers and communities. They are truly the success of CarMax. So we look forward to truly the success of CarMax. So we look forward to talking again next quarter. Thank you for your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Bill Nash : Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered a record level of used sales for the second quarter and all-time record for wholesale vehicle sales, as well as robust CarMax auto finance income growth.  For the second quarter of FY22, our diversified business model delivered totaled sales of $8 billion, up 49% compared with the second quarter of FY21, driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.72, down $0.07 from a year ago as we rolled over last year\u2019s pandemic-driven expense reductions and also continued to invest in our growth. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 420,000 cars in total, up 20% versus the second quarter last year. For the six months of FY22, we have sold approximately 872,000 retail and wholesale cars combined. We also bought 59% more cars from consumers in the second quarter this year versus last year and achieved record self sufficiency of approximately 70%.  Our omnichannel platform, unique customer offerings, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter were up 6.7% and used unit comps were up 6.2% versus the second quarter last year despite headwinds from inventory levels, staffing, and overall used car valuations. Our teams made steady progress in building our saleable inventory during the quarter and we achieved sequential growth each month despite the strong retail demand that carried into the second quarter. While it remains below our targeted levels, we are on pace to grow our saleable inventory during the balance of the year. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,185 of retail gross profit per used unit, in line with our historical second quarter performance. For wholesale, units sold were up 41.4% from a record second quarter last year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,005 compared with $1,086 for the same period last year. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering that rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on edmunds.com last year. We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax auto finance, or CAF continued to deliver solid results with income of $200 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers, though we did see a sequential decline in Tier 3 volume relative to the first quarter. John will provide more details on customer financing and CAF contribution shortly. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance, followed by John. After that, I\u2019ll update you on the progress against our strategic priorities and then open up the call to Q&A. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks Bill and good morning everyone.  Total gross profit was $815 million, up 8% over last year\u2019s second quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31%, and used vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Other gross profit was $120 million, down $7 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. Favorability in the quarter included $22 million of margin contribution from Edmunds since our June 1, 2021 acquisition. This was on revenues of $34.5 million, which is noted as advertising and subscription revenues in the earnings release. Other gross profit also benefited from an $18 million improvement in third party finance fees with income of $3 million compared with $15 million in costs last year. This was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year and our renegotiated third party finance fees.  Offsetting this favorability, service was down $40 million, primarily the result of rolling over of favorable items from the prior year\u2019s quarter and short term headwinds during this year\u2019s quarter. Specifically, we comped over last year\u2019s COVID-related cost reductions. Additionally, we experienced higher 90-day warranty cost timing stemming from the significant increase in sales during the first quarter of fiscal year \u201922 compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. We also realized lower retail service margin as production capacity was focused on reconditioning retail cars. Also impacting other gross profit, EPP was down $6 million or 5.4%. While penetration was stable at above 60%, last year\u2019s second quarter included a benefit of approximately $8 million in profit sharing revenues that was not recognized this year due to a timing shift in the performance period for one of our providers. On the S&GA front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $574 million, up 30% from our COVID impacted quarter a year ago and as we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives and growth. As a reminder, last year during the pandemic, we took aggressive cost containment actions particularly during the first half of the year. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.4% compared to 58.8% during the prior year second quarter.  The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by three main factors : first, a $55 million increase in total compensation and benefits driven by staffing and sales growth and by the inclusion of Edmunds payroll this quarter; second, a $41 million increase in other overhead due to investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives; third, a $35 million increase in advertising expense as previously communicated to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omnichannel offerings, and drive customer acquisition. We estimate that the COVID-related cost savings in SG&A in the prior year quarter was between $25 million to $30 million. For the first six months of FY22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 64.8%, leveraging five points over last year\u2019s first half rate of 69.3%.  We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. We achieved an additional reduction year-over-year from our core CDC cost structure during the second quarter. Additionally, our omnichannel capabilities will unlock new opportunities as we leverage automation to reduce expenses and streamline operations. For example, our online instant offer program in resulting in more efficient buying organization as we continue to leverage the power of automation, AI and data science. On capital allocation, our ongoing focus is to deploy capital in our business to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value. That includes investing in digital capabilities to enhance all aspects of our omnichannel experience, such as online vehicle acquisition which is already generating a strong ROI. We also continue to invest in the strategic expansion of our store footprint and look for additional paths to create incremental value.  In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares in the quarter for approximately $220 million. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John. Jon Daniels : Thanks Enrique and good morning everybody.  Once again, our finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the second quarter, CAF\u2019s penetration net of three-day payoffs was 43% compared with 42.6% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 21.6% of used unit sales compared with 22.3% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 7.2% compared with 11.1% a year ago. As a reminder, last year CAF decided to strategically route a portion of its Tier 1 volume and all of its allocated Tier 3 volume to partners to preserve the high quality of its portfolio during the start of the pandemic. These changes were rolled back by the end of Q2 last year. During the quarter, we observed strong offers from our Tier 2 partners as they competed for additional volume within the CarMax channel. We also saw a decrease in application volume and conversion to sale for applications in the lower portion of the credit spectrum. We believe these decreases are due in large part to the higher average selling prices seen across the industry. During this year\u2019s second quarter on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF\u2019s net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 8.2% a year ago but down from 9% in the first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the change in credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. For our portfolio, overall interest margin increased to 7.2% versus 6% in the same period last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $65 million or 33%. This strong net interest margin highlights the strength of our ABS program and the favorable state of the capital markets. Given we recognize income over the life of our loans, we will benefit from this higher net interest margin across multiple years. CAF\u2019s income for the quarter was $200 million, up from $147 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of the stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. Our expense related to the provision in the second quarter was $35 million and resulted in an ending reserve balance of $398 million for the second quarter, or 2.66% of managed receivables. This is in line with the 2.62% at the end of the first quarter while also reflecting a modestly higher percentage of Tier 3 loans in the portfolio as a result of our decision to retain 10% of Tier 3 volume. We believe our future outlook on losses and corresponding reserve is appropriate given the current macroeconomic environment. With regard to our lending platform and specifically where CAF participates across the credit spectrum, we are constantly evaluating the landscape and remain committed to making decisions that we believe are sustainable in the long term and in the best interests of our customers. During the second quarter in coordination with our business partners, we began a small test of CAF originating in the Tier 2 space. Much like when CAF entered Tier 3, this test will remain in place at low volumes for an extended period as we take the time to understand both the Tier 2 customer and how CAF\u2019s participation in this space can best enhance the range of credit options, improve the customer experience, and drive profitability. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you Jon, thank you Enrique.  I\u2019m very proud of how our teams have driven strong results this quarter across our diversified business model, and we\u2019re excited about the incredible opportunity that lies ahead. We\u2019ve intentionally built our omnichannel platform to give every customer the ability to progress to a sale or a buy, regardless of how they shop with us. We\u2019ve found that most customers don\u2019t want to shop for a car in a way that is tied solely to an in-store or digital experience. While we provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online, our omnichannel capabilities really differentiate CarMax by enabling our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs. In the second quarter, approximately 9% of our retail unit sales were online, consistent with our first quarter and up from the prior year\u2019s quarter of 3%. As a reminder, we consider it an online retail sale when a customer completes all four of the major transactional activity remotely, so that\u2019s reserving a car, financing the vehicle if that\u2019s needed, trading in or opting out of a trade-in, and creating a sales order. Our wholesale auctions remains virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenues resulting from online transactions was 28%. This is up from 24% in the first quarter and up from 18% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, flat to the first quarter and up from the prior year\u2019s second quarter of 49%. Omni sales are those where our customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely.  We\u2019ve been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience, where customers can independently complete the entire car buying process online if they so choose. Currently, a little more than 50% of our customers have access to a complete end-to-end, unaided online experience. We are on track to bring this capability to all of our retail consumers by the end of the fiscal year. Remember, while rolling out access to these capabilities will enable more customers to complete a 100% self-service online experience, all customers currently can buy a car online with assistance from an associate. In the second quarter, we bought approximately 188,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That\u2019s a 15% increase from our record first quarter number. This growth supports our belief that we\u2019ve become and are further expanding our position as the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S. We are continuously enhancing our ecommerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. Let me share a few examples. One of the areas we\u2019ve enhanced is our financing process. Nearly 65% of our finance customers start their loan process online with a pre-approval application, and as of the second quarter 100% of those customers now receive a digital decision that includes customized loan terms. A majority of those customers through no additional time or effort are provided digital access to their personal financing terms on every care in our inventory, allowing them to shop with more confidence. In addition, what differentiates our experience is the ability to provide these inventory-wide credit offers using multiple finance partners, including CAF. This ensures we provide our customers with the most attractive rates and terms. We\u2019re excited about our progress on this crucial part of the car buying journey. We also continue to advance what we believe is industry-leading digital merchandising, which is critical to providing customer an immersive experience with our inventory as they shop remotely. This quarter, we added 360 degree interior views from the driver\u2019s side and the back seat of the vehicle and continue to advance vehicle hotspots, which are call-outs to help the customer understand key vehicle features. We also continue to leverage artificial intelligence to ensure that our photos are consistently high quality to best represent our inventory. We\u2019re hearing very positive feedback on these advancements that help customers understand and fall in love with our vehicles as they shop online. In relation to our acquisition of Edmunds, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress as our teams have hit the ground running on new innovations. We will continue to invest in the Edmunds brand and work together to unlock opportunities to compete across the larger used auto ecosystem. We are really proud of the quarter and the significant progress we have made in advancing our omnichannel strategy. We are well positioned to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the used auto industry, which will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long term shareholder value. With that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions, so Kevin? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning Brian. Brian Nagel : David, congratulations on the new role. David Lowenstein : Thank you. Brian Nagel : I guess the question I want to ask, and I know you talked about this a bit in your comments, but as we look at this quarter and the 6.2% used unit comp, maybe you can help us better contextualize that. I mean, against that backdrop and clearly with COVID, coming out of the COVID crisis, a lot of the internal initiatives, is there a way to think about that number on a more normalized basis? How is it tracking versus what you view as the real health, the underlying health of your business?  Then as a follow-up, just from a positioning standpoint, you and your team are talking more and more now about used cars together with wholesale cars as a measure of overall sales. Does that reflect more a strategic shift on the part of CarMax? Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you for the questions, Brian. On the first question, look - we\u2019re really pleased with the roughly 6% comps, and I say that because you also have to put a little context around the environment. We had several headwinds that we also faced during the quarter. First of all, inventory - inventory is lower than where we want to be. It\u2019s probably about 30% off of--at the end of the quarter, probably about 30% off of where we would normally target. In addition to the inventory headwind, we were understaffed and we still are understaffed, but not to the degree. We were understaffed pretty much across the board, and that\u2019s important not only because it hinders our ability to hit our SLAs, but in some cases we just weren\u2019t able to get back with customers, which is never a good thing, and so we\u2019re working on that. Then I think also just a broader macro thing is just the used car valuations. I mean, year-over-year the acquisition prices are up about $6,000, and I think Enrique talked about in his opening remarks--or Jon talked about in his opening remarks about how that may push some used car customers just out of the market. I think when you take the comp in that light with those headwinds, those headwinds when you add them all together are material headwinds, so we feel great about the comps for the quarter and we also feel great about the overall progress. On your second question, how we talk about used and wholesale, yes - we do talk a little bit differently about that, but I think that really goes back to a little bit of what I talked about on analyst day, which is--you know, people always think about us as this used car retailer, and that is in fact great, but we\u2019re much more than that. We\u2019re a great retailer, a great wholesaler, a greater financier. We\u2019ve added Edmunds, we\u2019ve got dealer services, and it really goes to this broader used auto ecosystem, so that\u2019s really kind of the change as to why we talk about both. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s helpful, Bill. Just a follow-up on the initial question, is there a way to quantify what that 6.2 would have been had you not faced these headwinds in the quarter? Bill Nash : Yes I\u2019ll tell you, Brian, it\u2019s hard, and I\u2019ll give you one example. The inventory being that down, that substantially down inventory would be just in itself a significant headwind. Now, I will tell you, I don\u2019t think the normal elasticity applies right now because a lot of folks are under-inventoried; but what I will tell you is we feel like when you take all three of those things and add them up, they\u2019re material headwinds, so again we\u2019re pleased with how the quarter came out from a comp perspective and just overall. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. The inventory dynamic has been, I think, pretty obvious throughout the quarter for anyone kind of looking at your website. What is your line of sight into getting inventory back into kind of more normalized levels? I know you mentioned you expect it to continue to improve, as it did during the August quarter, but is this something where you\u2019re three, six months out? To quantify, is it a staffing issue, is it the acquiring of vehicles that\u2019s the issue? Help us understand where the pinch point is right now on the inventory side. Bill Nash : Thank you Sharon. Well first of all, it\u2019s not acquiring the vehicles. I talked in my opening remarks just about the fact that we\u2019re approximately 70% self sufficient, so it\u2019s definitely not the sourcing. As I talked about with Brian\u2019s question, it certainly has been a headwind and it really all relates back to what happened in the fourth and the first quarter. The fourth quarter is typically a time when we build our inventory up - we weren\u2019t able to do that because of COVID and some winter disruption production, then we had record sales in the first quarter, so we\u2019re still digging out of that hole. Like I told Brian, we\u2019re about 30% light to target, we\u2019re about 15% year-over-year. If you look at last year\u2019s second quarter to where we\u2019re this second quarter, we\u2019re about 15% light. We did make great progress sequentially every month. We grew our inventory, and look - we plan to continue to build inventory over the rest of the year, and I think the timing is really going to be--when we get back to where we want to be will really depend somewhat on the demand. As far as staffing, yes - during the quarter, although we were able to build inventory, we did have some headwinds even on the staffing side; but again, I think staffing in general, we\u2019re making great progress. We made great progress staffing across the board throughout the quarter and we continue to make great progress in this quarter as well. Sharon Zackfia : I know you mentioned to Brian that it\u2019s kind of hard to quantify the impact of the inventory, but I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen conversion go down, just because obviously every used car is like a snowflake and if you don\u2019t have as broad an inventory, you have to be losing sales. Is there any way to look at conversion as a metric that might indicate what\u2019s been left on the table? Bill Nash : Yes, I think conversion was down a little bit. We look at conversion a couple different ways, both conversion from when they start top of funnel, but then also in the store. The store was fairly strong, but up top of the funnel we saw conversion go down, which we think is a great opportunity because we\u2019ve always said--you know, one of the main reasons people don\u2019t buy from us is because we don\u2019t have the vehicle they\u2019re looking for, and that certainly is magnified when your inventory is down. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick Nelson : Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on CAF and the strategy to more Tier 3 business at CAF. Can you compare the profitability of a Tier 3 unit sale to a third party lender, and what are the risks, I guess, with this strategy? Jon Daniels : Sure, yes. Appreciate your question, Rick. With regard to a Tier 3 unit, so Tier 3 sale from a finance perspective, obviously there is generally a higher cost to fund, there\u2019s a higher risk customer there, but it\u2019s going to be just a little south of maybe a more prime loan, if you will, so depending on the funding environment and obviously the APR we can charge, but say in that $2,000 to $2,100 range if you\u2019re able to capture all the finance economics potentially. But there is higher risk there, so there\u2019s a funding aspect there.   Now obviously with our partners, we were able to renegotiate fees. We\u2019re currently paying $750 to those Tier 3 loans that our partners pick up, and obviously we mentioned beginning--over the course of Q1, we started taking about 10% of the volume within the Tier 3 space. We\u2019re happy with that volume and we appreciate it, and we\u2019ll continue to assess the mix that we should have. But ultimately for us, we want to make sure that whether we take more Tier 3, our partners take more Tier 3, we want to make sure that we are able to provide great credit offers to those customers. In our current credit platform construct, we feel we do that, so those are the economics at play that answers your question.  But again, we love the way it\u2019s constructed today and we provide great offers to those customers. Bill Nash : Yes, and Rick, the only thing I would add to that, whether it\u2019s Tier 3 or Tier 2 for that matter, it really is about balancing the sustainability of the program, the profitability, and then the customer experience, so we take all that into consideration. Rick Nelson : Fair enough. Thanks and good luck. Bill Nash : Thank you Rick. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  Bill, the surge in vehicles sourced from your online appraisal tool is really impressive. Do you have a feel for what those sellers would have done without the tool - would they have shown up at a CarMax store, would they have gone to another dealer, would they have sold through some person-to-person listing service? Where are they coming from? Bill Nash : Craig, I think--look, we\u2019re pleased with the online. I think we\u2019re getting a lot of incremental units there, because even our traditional appraisal lane is still very strong. I\u2019m not sure where they would have gone, but we absolutely feel there\u2019s a tremendous incremental value there by the fact that we are offering this service, so maybe they would have gone and sold in other channels, I don\u2019t know which channels, but we feel good about the incrementality. Craig Kennison : And what percentage of online offers are you able to purchase, and does that tell you anything about the competitiveness of your offer? Bill Nash : Yes, so our buy rate--you know, traditionally how we\u2019ve talked about the buy rate is through our appraisal and our trade--appraisal lane buy rate is still--I mean, it\u2019s very high, it\u2019s in the low 30s. On the online offers, the way we really look at this at this point is if you get an online offer, because think about it, we\u2019re putting millions of online offers out there each quarter. The way we think about it is, okay, once we\u2019ve put an offer, of those customers how many show up at the store, and of those customers that show up at the store, how many of them actually sell? As you can imagine, that buy rate--the customers that show up with an online offer that actually sell is actually much higher than the traditional A-lane. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Rajat Gupta : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just had a question on some of the investments that you had made in the second quarter. Clearly advertising picked up, the other investments picked up, you\u2019ve added more headcount. Could you give us any color on how much of this has started to benefit comps? Maybe if you could give us some color on how September is tracking, that would be useful. Then just on GPU, given the rising used vehicle pricing environment you\u2019re back in again, great August into September, likely into October-November as well, you\u2019ve previously given us some color on [indiscernible] number for retail GPU. Any similar color you could provide us for fourth quarter as well? That\u2019d be useful, and that will be all, thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Hey Rajat. With regard to SG&A, we firmly believe that now is the right time to invest in growing our business. We\u2019re very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our business, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our growth, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the omni and ecommerce functionality as we move forward. But we are on track by the end of this year to offer up to all of our retail customers 100% self sufficiency online, our self service online. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the acquisition of customers by marketing.  The investment in marketing is something that we had communicated last year, that we were going to step up our marketing advertising and other channels as well. Again, we believe we have a superior platform and we want to make sure that we\u2019re communicating that in an effective way to our consumers, but at the same time there\u2019s also a very targeted ROI opportunity in advertising as well that we\u2019re investing in, and then lastly we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the acquisition of vehicles. The instant offer program that we launched that has had tremendous success is just an example of one of those investments that just provides an outstanding ROI, so we\u2019re going to continue to invest. Now that being said, we do expect to lever over the longer term because at the same time that we\u2019re investing, we also have cost efficiency plays, whether it\u2019s the CECs or whether it\u2019s the buying organization or whether it\u2019s other channels as well. We have opportunities to get more efficient in how we work, and so we\u2019ll continue to do that. But I think it is important to remember that we\u2019re on track with our investments, we\u2019re on track with our performance at this point. Bill Nash : Yes, and Rajat, the only thing I would add to that is on the--like, the advertising for example, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of that. We saw about a 19% increase in web traffic. Our average flow to our website was about--it\u2019s a little more than 34 million a month, so that\u2019s another example where you feel like the investment\u2019s paying off. As far as the second part of your question, the GPU, it\u2019s a great question. I kind of think about--we\u2019re in a very similar situation today that we were last quarter when we talked about this. We\u2019re constantly testing. A couple quarters ago we talked about doing some broader scale testing just because of some of the other factors, some of the other profit channels that were coming through the organization, and while those still exist, just like last quarter, we really wanted to make sure--you\u2019ve got to monitor the macro factors and does it make sense. You\u2019ve got to look at your inventory levels, you\u2019ve got to understand the elasticity which, again, we\u2019re still getting the read on elasticity with the tests that we always have going, you want to see what competitors are doing, and it just didn\u2019t make sense to deviate more from that historical trend that we have on margins. At the end of the day, we want to have very, very competitive--competitively priced inventory. I think with the self sufficiency, that certainly helps.  I think going forward, how you should think about the third quarter is probably GPUs more in line with historical averages, just like the second quarter was. Operator : Thank you. Again ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press the star then the one key on your touchtone telephone. Our next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore. Michael Montani : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the comps throughout the quarter and then to start the third quarter. From our work, it looked like the trends had accelerated nicely into August and basically could have been up double digits into September, so just wanted to see if you all would comment on that, if you could do it quantitatively, and if not that, if you could provide some color as to why trends may have strengthened, if it\u2019s inventories or enhanced multi channel. Bill Nash : Yes, good morning Michael. Obviously I\u2019ve already said we\u2019re pleased with overall comps for the quarter. We had positive comps every single month and we really continue to trend. It started since March. March was not only a record, all-time high record, but it was a record for the month. April-May-June-July-August have all in their respective been a record month for us, so we feel great about that. To your point, we\u2019re also very pleased with the start of the third quarter. Now, obviously we\u2019ll talk more in detail about that at the end of the third quarter. Michael Montani : Okay, and then if I could, just on the margin front, two questions there. One was some folks had been anticipating a little upside on GPU due to pretty inelastic demand at the moment. Just wanted to understand if there\u2019s something we need to also consider in terms of the volatility of the pricing in the environment, or if perhaps there\u2019s more investment you all are making. Then the other one was just on advertising spend for the year and if there\u2019s any kind of cost reductions to consider as we cycle 3Q and 4Q. What you called out in 2Q was helpful, $25 million, $30 million. Bill Nash : Okay, yes. On the margins, look - we\u2019re always looking at our margins, and I know we probably have some competitors where the big spike up in average selling prices, they\u2019ll take more margin. You\u2019ve followed us long enough to know that ASPs don\u2019t really drive our margins. We feel very comfortable about where our margins are. For us, it\u2019s about making sure we get a great margin but also having great prices, so again to the question I answered earlier, I think the third quarter, you can think about margins more in the historical trend. Could you have taken more margin? Yes, but again, we\u2019re in this for the long haul and we want to make sure our prices are super competitive all the time, and we feel great about that.  I\u2019ll let Enrique speak to the advertising. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, so two questions. On advertising, we had communicated earlier this year that our expectation for advertising on a per-unit basis for this year was going to be similar to what we spent in the back half of last year, so somewhere in the mid-300s per unit, and we\u2019re on track so far this year and our expectation is that we\u2019re going to meet that for the full year. In regards to comping over COVID and the $25 million to $30 million that we estimate that last year was kind of one-time savings, that was really focused on the front half of the year. There still are some of those that will carry over into Q3, but not to the same level of materiality as what we saw certainly in the first two quarters of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around GPU and the pricing environment. Bill, maybe you can comment on what\u2019s happening with wholesale price trends and retail price trends through the quarter and how that\u2019s impacted your retail GPU. Bill Nash : Yes, so obviously retail, if I look at it from a mix adjustment standpoint, retail pricing was up about--from an acquisition standpoint, was up about $6,000. Wholesale was up probably around $3,000, so both are--actually as long as I\u2019ve been doing this, those are the biggest jumps I can remember ever seeing. Now, I think the fact that self sufficiency is so high for us, I think that provides us a lot of opportunities as we go forward because that comes into play on not only a margin but your pricing structure. I think during the quarter, what we saw was--you know, we came out of the first quarter very high elevated prices. It hung in there for a little while. We then actually saw a little bit of depreciation take place, but surprisingly it started to appreciate again, so when we went back, I think we finished the quarter probably at the high that we finished the first quarter. It\u2019s a very interesting dynamic. I can only speculate - you know, maybe because of the chip shortages, it looks like it\u2019s going to be longer than I think what people originally thought of for new cars. I think maybe there\u2019s some folks out there buying more used cars to replenish their lots since they\u2019re not going to have new cars, but it is an interesting dynamic that we\u2019re seeing. Seth Basham : Yes, so the fact that prices started to appreciate again after the back half of your quarter unexpectedly should indicate that you could have captured incremental margin on those unit sales, so your GPU exiting the quarter was probably stronger than it was in the beginning of the quarter? Is that the right way to think about it? Bill Nash : No, I would just think that pretty much--you know the way we manage our GPU really doesn\u2019t--it doesn\u2019t take into consideration the average selling prices. There\u2019s other factors that go into that, so I would think it\u2019s fairly consistent throughout the quarter is the way you should think about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Why are you guys still buying back stock? I mean, you have such an unbelievable--once in a generation growth opportunity, you\u2019re up against competitors that have a license to lose money and zero expectation to return cash. I understand the business spins off cash and everything, but isn\u2019t it time to change the philosophy and just double down on the growth of the business and cut the buyback stuff? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Like you said, we generate--we\u2019re blessed with an operating model and a business model that generates a significant amount of cash, and we\u2019re making the investments we think are the right investments at the right time, can generate our growth, and we still--still with that in mind, we believe we have excess cash to buy back stock and return it back to shareholders. We\u2019re not holding back on our level of investments, and you can see that in our spend and in our capex, that we are investing aggressively. We\u2019ll continue to do so and even in that scenario, we have enough cash to buy back shares. We are not holding back on our investments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. Just a question on two pressure points. First on inventory, it certainly seems--Bill, you just alluded to and based on what we know on the new vehicle side, that this inventory shortage on the new vehicle side is going to persist well into next year and certainly probably past mid next year, calendar year 2022. I\u2019m just curious if you think the dynamics will be relieved until we get there, and then also as you think about the staffing levels, finding folks at reasonable prices is getting harder and harder, so that cost inflation on the SG&A side and staffing up might be difficult as well. I\u2019m just trying to understand if you can change strategy, alter strategy, or just change your growth strategy as you fight through these two macro factors, and when they\u2019ll be relieved, because it\u2019s kind of masking all the good stuff you\u2019re doing and it\u2019s muddling the story, but it\u2019s not your fault and they\u2019re macro issues that you\u2019re just going to have to fight through. Bill Nash : Yes, I think whatever I tell you on the chip situation, probably the only thing I can guarantee is I\u2019ll be wrong; but I do agree with you, I think it\u2019s going to persist throughout this year, which could keep used cars at an elevated--you know, it will persist through this year and, I think, pretty much through next year or a good part of next year, which will keep prices elevated. But it\u2019s also the reason why I\u2019m so excited about the investments we\u2019ve made in vehicle acquisition and things like our instant offer, because that really helps to offset some of those headwinds and really gives us a lot of opportunity. Like I said earlier, we\u2019re making strides, continuing to get our inventory up, so we feel good about that. On the staffing, look - we\u2019ve always invested in our associates. They\u2019re the reason of our success, and during this time period, you know every employer is out there looking for staffing, and we\u2019re no different. We\u2019ve continued to invest more in this quarter in our associates, we\u2019ve made pay changes that we feel really great about. We also--look, for 17 years in a row, we\u2019ve been one of the best places to work, which is a great thing from an employer brand standpoint, so again even on the staffing side, we feel great about the trajectory that we\u2019re going on. So yes, there are some headwinds there, but we\u2019re progressing both on the inventory side and both on the staffing, and feel great about some of the opportunities that we have that things like self sufficiency and IO give you. John Murphy : Is it fair to say, or maybe just a follow-up, the SG&A leverage is going to be difficult to get through this period of macro pressure? It just seems like--I mean, you guys have executed incredibly well on same store sales and grosses despite these headwinds. I think some people are concerned about it, but then what you\u2019ve done this quarter is pretty remarkable on the grosses and the volumes. Are you going to be able to get SG&A leverage until we get through the end of calendar year 2022? It just seems like it\u2019s going to be hard to pull off. What\u2019s your thought about that and where should we think about that inflection point? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, we certainly are in investment mode, as we\u2019ve made clear, and you can go back to our analyst day. We\u2019re really focused on driving our top line. We are focused on driving market share and meeting and exceeding our target that we laid out there, which is greater than 5% market share by FY26, and that does require investments like we\u2019ve been talking about, the investments in the different areas that we mentioned, certainly.  Will it be harder to leverage? Well, in that kind of environment it is a little harder to leverage, right, and our expectation is that our gross profit will continue to grow, it will grow robustly, and on the back of that gross profit growth, there are opportunities to leverage specifically for this year for the entire year. Our expectation continues to be that we should be able to leverage for this year. It\u2019s hard to look quarter to quarter. You just can\u2019t look in quarter to quarter just because there\u2019s so many things that pop in and out of a quarter; but for the full year, we feel pretty good about that. Then moving forward, again we are in growth mode and we\u2019re investing accordingly, and at the same time and as I speak to every quarter, we do look at opportunities to get more efficient. There are investments we\u2019re making to drive the top line, there are investments we\u2019re making to help pull out cost as well, and we always have a sharp eye to that, so we\u2019ll continue to do our best on that. At the same time, we are focused on market share growth and the opportunities that lay ahead of us, and we\u2019re really excited about them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim. Ali Faghri : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Sorry, but another question on retail GPU here. I recognize that retail prices don\u2019t really drive CarMax\u2019s GPU, but just the self sourcing improvement from sub-50% to 70% this quarter by itself should have been a big boost to GPU given the cost advantage from acquiring from consumers versus auction. I know you said you kept your prices competitive, but it also doesn\u2019t seem, at least based on our work, that you are meaningfully outperforming peers on volumes either, so how do I tie that all together? Bill Nash : Yes, well first of all, we feel really good about our pricing position, and we\u2019ve been looking at this for a very long time, so we feel very good about where we are from a pricing standpoint. Look, this is one quarter. Some things have a longer tail, but I would also go back to the fact that, look, we had some major headwinds, and when you add them all up together, they were hard to overcome, which I\u2019ve already talked about - you know, the inventory, just the pricing, the staffing. Those are headwinds over the self sufficiency. I think what we\u2019re most excited about is this self sufficiency and the opportunity that that gives us as we continue to move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. I hear you say you\u2019re happy with pricing, but then when I look at Page 6 at the GPU, gross margin per unit there, it\u2019s down considerably year-over-year and also down versus the quarter two years ago. It\u2019s obviously a competitive marketplace though, too. Do you [indiscernible] to raise prices? Bill Nash : Well David, just so we\u2019re clear, the GPU, if you look at it--like, last year, second quarter was a record GPU and we\u2019re only a little bit off of that, so I would say if you look at our historical average, we\u2019re on the higher end of GPU. I think there might be a little disconnect there. Could we raise GPUs? Absolutely, and look - we\u2019re going to continue to monitor the macro factors to see what makes sense. Self sufficiency gives us a lot of opportunities as we go forward, but I think at the same time, we are in this for the long term and we want to make sure customers are getting great value every day, and so we\u2019re going to continue to weigh all factors as we go forward. David Whiston : Okay. Just to be clear, I was talking about the 8.3% versus the 11%, and then the 10.5% two years ago. That\u2019s why I asked about pricing. Bill Nash : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. You were talking more as it relates to ASP? Yes, and again, I\u2019d just throw that out-- Enrique Mayor-Mora: If you look at it on a per-unit basis, it\u2019s going to be skewed, artificially skewed as a percent of revenue just because retail prices are just up, like, 30% since the beginning of the year, so it\u2019s hard to look at as a percent of revenue. We really look at the business on a per-unit basis. Bill Nash : Yes, and we manage it differently than a lot of the other publicly traded auto retailers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick ones on other gross profit. I guess just first, trying to understand the service gross profit seemingly went negative this quarter because of the warranty issue. Next quarter or whenever, does this go back to the 20% to 30% gross margin rate you\u2019ve historically had, or is there something, like some kind of a lag, to all this warranty stuff that we should be thinking about? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, service this quarter, we were upside down $40 million year-over-year on the quarter, and we estimate that a material amount of that were headwinds we faced in the quarter, that were really shorter term in nature. The two largest ones I\u2019d tell you, number one was the 90-day warranty that you mentioned, and when you think about it, right, our comps this year in the first quarter were 99%. Last year in the first quarter, they were negative 42%, and so you\u2019re looking at a lot more volume from a 90-day perspective warranty work that carries over into the subsequent quarter, so that very much is a timing play right there.  Then the second piece is, similar to SG&A, we just had prior year one-time COVID-related savings in support pay and the employee retention credit plan as well, that are more shorter term in nature. The material amount of that is really shorter term. What I\u2019d say is historically we\u2019ve run service as a positive margin contributor. The exception was last year - certainly during COVID it was not, but prior years it had been a positive margin contributor, and as we move forward on an annual basis, we do expect that to continue to be a positive margin contributor as well. But this quarter, certainly those two headwinds made it a little bit harder. Operator : Thank you. Again ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press the star then the one key on your touchtone telephone. Our next question is a follow-up question from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Rajat Gupta : Thanks for letting me get back in the queue here. I just wanted to follow up in terms of a housekeeping question around SG&A. How much of the quarter-over-quarter pick-up in SG&A was due to the Edmunds acquisition, and if you could say what are some of the buckets in SG&A also, that might be very helpful. Thank you. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, as regards to Edmunds, I spoke in my prepared remarks that from a gross profit standpoint, Edmunds contributed about $20 million. You\u2019re going to see that in the 10-Q tomorrow when we file. Overall, so it\u2019s an operating segment, Edmunds is-we\u2019re going to be reporting on it as an operating segment, not a reporting segment, so we\u2019re going to be reporting moving forward on their revenues, on their gross profit, but that\u2019s the extent to which we\u2019re going to report on them. What I could tell you, though Rajat, is that overall, they were slightly accretive to CarMax, so you can kind of back into their SG&A using that kind of approach. Operator : I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Bill Nash for any closing comments. Bill Nash : Great, thank you Kevin. Well listen, thanks for joining us today, for your questions and your continued support. We\u2019re confident in our ability to seamlessly merge our world-class in-person and online experiences, add to that our diversified business model and we\u2019ll be able to continue to drive growth and market share gains as we move forward.  As always, I want to thank our more than 27,000 associates for your continued dedication, to living our values each day, taking care of each other, the customers and our communities. You all are the reason that we remain a positive disruptive force within the used car industry.  Again, thanks for everyone\u2019s time today, and we will talk again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're very pleased with this quarter. We delivered record levels of used and wholesale sales, as well as EPS for the third quarter. We also delivered all-time high margins in both used and wholesale. For the third quarter of FY \u201922, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.5 billion up 64% compared with the third quarter of FY \u201821, driven by both higher average selling prices and volume gains. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.63, up 15% from a year ago. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 415,000 cars in total, up 29% versus third quarter last year. For the first nine months of FY \u201922, we sold approximately 1.3 million retail and wholesale cars combined, as we set new records in each month. We continue to be the largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 383,000 cars from consumers in the third quarter, which is up 91% versus last year. And again, we achieve self-sufficiency above 70%. Our customer-centric omni-channel strategy, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter were up 16.9% and used unit comps were up 15.8 versus the third quarter last year. We experienced robust demand as we ramped staffing levels and built inventory. CAF and our credit partners also supported our sales by continuing to deliver strong credit offers, even as our average sales price grew by over 30% year-over-year. We achieved sequential growth and saleable inventory each month within the quarter. While inventory and staffing remain below our targets, we are pleased with our momentum and are confident that we have access to the resources we need to build inventory ahead of tax season, the retail demand will determine the pace. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported record retail gross profit per use unit of $2,235, up $84 per unit versus the third quarter last year. With used car prices at all-time highs, we chose to pass along the majority of our self-sufficiency driven acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between increasing our margins and supporting our customers in atomic elevated industry prices. Wholesale units were up 48.5% from the third quarter last year, and gross profit per unit achieved an all-time record of $1,131 compared with $906 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $166 million down from $176 million during the same period last year. CAF margins remain strong. Year-over-year financial results were impacted by a $68 million headwind and reserve adjustments. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic, and this year's quarter reflects a more normalized provision. CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers. In a few moments, Jon will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions, as well as on the impact of the auto loan receivable systems conversion. Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Total gross profit was $837 million, up 32% from last year's record third quarter. This was driven by a wholesale vehicle margin of $212 million, which was up 85%, and used vehicle margin of $508 million, which was up 21% from last year's third quarter. Other gross profit was $116 million, up 18% from last year's third quarter. Favorability in the quarter included $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds. Other gross profit also benefited from a $12 million improvement in third-party finance fees, with income of $1.6 million compared to a $10.6 million cost last year. This was driven by renegotiated third-party finance fees and lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year. Also, positively impacting other gross profit, EPP was up $5 million or 4.8%. While penetration was stable at approximately 60%, this year's third quarter reflects a $6 million unfavorable return reserve adjustment compared to a $3 million favorable return reserve adjustment during the prior year's quarter. Partially offsetting gross profit favorability, service was down $21 million from the prior year's quarter. This was driven by pressure primarily related to our efforts to grow technician staffing, as well as a shift in some retail service capacity to instead support use car reconditioning. Service gross profit versus the prior year period improved in each month during the quarter, and we anticipate that results will continue to improve into the fourth quarter. On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter increased to $576 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter, due to costs related to unit volume growth and continued investment in our strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was roughly flat at 68.8% compared to 68.2% during the third quarter last year. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by three main factors. First, a $100 million increase in total compensation and benefits, driven by a strong ramp in staffing, a $23 million increase in stock-based compensation, unit volume-related commissions, and the inclusion of Edmunds payroll this quarter versus a year ago. Second, a $22 million increase in other overhead, which includes our receipt of a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. The remainder of the change primarily reflects investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives, and the impact of COVID-related cost savings in the prior year quarter.  And third, a $17 million increase in advertising expense, as previously communicated to drive customer acquisition and to amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omni-channel offerings. For the first nine months of fiscal year \u201922, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 66.1%, leveraging approximately three points over last year's nine months percentage of 68.9%. We remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend. And we expect that our targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver results over time. During the third quarter, from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective, we saw solid improvements in the service levels of our CECs and their conversion of web leads. This was despite the record level of volume that our CECs handled in the third quarter. This improvement was due to a combination of successful staffing ramps, and ongoing utilization of our AI and machine learning processes that drive the right work to the right associates. We also continue to see efficiency gains in our buying organization. The combination of our instant offer program along with the investments we've made in data science, automation and AI, continue to materially drive down our costs per buy. From a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt to capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%.  During the quarter, we entered into a $700 million term loan agreement primarily to support the growth of our total inventory dollars. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, and repurchased approximately 850,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $115 million. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique. Good morning, everyone. Once again, our finance business has delivered solid results. For the third quarter, CAF\u2019s penetration net of three day payoffs was 42.2%, compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit sales, compared with 19.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.5% of sales, compared with 9.7% a year ago. The year-over-year change in CAF penetration was driven by a larger percentage of customers, leveraging cash or outside financing for the purchase of their vehicle, while as CAF comping over a historically high penetration in Q3 of FY \u201821. We continue to observe strong credit offers from our Tier 2 partners as they compete for additional volume within the CarMax channel. These offers along with a decrease in application volume and the lower portion of the credit spectrum contributed to the swap in volume between Tiers 2 and 3. CarMax continues to provide outstanding access to financing for our customers across the credit spectrum. Our approval rates this quarter remain over 95%, despite financing amounts that are approximately 25% above the same period in 2020. This ability to maintain such a strong credit offering speaks to the value of our multi lender credit platform supported by CAF, and our long-term finance partners. During this year\u2019s third quarter on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF\u2019s net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.3%, down from 8.6% a year ago, and 8.5% in the second quarter. The difference in APR is primarily a result of the change in the credit mix of customers, along with rate testing, that CAF executed within the quarter. CAF income for the quarter was $166 million, down $10 million from the same period last year. This included a more normalized loan loss provision of $76 million as compared to the significantly reduced provision of only $8 million in the same quarter last year that was driven by the continued reduction of the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic, almost fully offsetting the provision headwind with a year-over-year increase in total interest margin of $65 million or 7.2% of managed receivables. This year-over-year margin increase highlights the strength of our ABS program, the favorable state of the capital markets and our continued growth in receivables. The current quarter\u2019s provision of $76 million results in an ending reserve balance of $427 million or 2.75% of managed receivables. This is up from 2.66% at the end of the second quarter, and includes 6 basis point adjustments to the added Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume CAF is now originating. The adjustment was primarily driven by the implementation of our Tier 2 origination test. Remember, contribution from CAF originations is recognized over the life of the receivables, or the loss reserve is recognized at the time of origination. Note also, that the core portion of the reserve allocated to Tier 1 loan losses, remains well within our historical range of 2% to 2.5%. During the third quarter, we transitioned from CAF\u2019s legacy auto loan receivable servicing systems to brand new systems. The new platform went live in October and included a period of planned downtime and a number of operational areas, including collections and customer service. This required pause in our business resulted in an increase in delinquencies and losses that we expect to normalize over the coming months, as both our systems and processes stabilize. This had an immaterial impact to the loan loss provision on the quarter. Additionally, CAF absorbed roughly $5 million in deployment expense in the third quarter related to items such as temporary contractor support, proactive customer communication regarding the systems change, and added staffing to handle the elevated call volume once back online. We are extremely excited about this new platform that will not only provide CAF a modernized foundation for growth and efficiency, but will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and self service capabilities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CAF organization along with the corresponding project teams, who've worked so tirelessly to build in and implement such a transformative solution for both our associates and our customers. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. This quarter continues this year\u2019s strong top-line performance trend. We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in store or 100% online, and our omni-channel capabilities allow our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.  As our omni-channel and online sales continue to grow, we have observed that the vast majority of our customers who buy digitally still elect to take delivery in our stores. This is another proof point that our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transaction is providing value to our customers and is a key differentiator for us. In the third quarter, a little more than 9% of retail unit sales were online, up from the prior year's quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remained virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%, this is up from 20% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Approximately 57% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 49% in the prior year's quarters. We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience, where customers, if they choose to can independently complete the entire car buying process online. Currently, more than two-thirds of our customers have access to complete end-to-end, unaided online experience and increase from a little over 50% from our last call. This expansion reflects customer's ability to incorporate trade ends without lanes to their online orders. The remaining two use cases that we will be working through during the fourth quarter are paid transfers and trade ends with lanes. In the third quarter, we bought approximately 194,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a new record, a 4% increase from our second quarter number and a 19% increase compared to the first quarter. This growth supports our belief that we remain the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S. We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our online finance experience by expanding our finance-based shopping or FBS capability. FBS enables our customers to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website, which is a key differentiator in the retail marketplace.  Roughly 75% of our customers are able to enjoy this experience today. And going forward, we are working towards adding the remaining customers and integrating additional lenders to this experience. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we will be launching a more sophisticated version of the tool and increasing the speed of digital decisions. Again, we're proud of our strong results for this quarter and year-to-date. By delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry, we will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Jerome? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. You may now ask your question. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning and happy holidays. I guess a question on SG&A per car. I mean, it's been kind of at a double digit percentage rate over the last few quarters. And I know that's comparing against a year ago, capacity restrictions, and lesser investments in the business. But I'm curious what your line of sight is into kind of SG&A per car. We're turning into more of a low single digit percentage increase or even starting to leverage that in the future. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Hey, Sharon, good morning, Happy Holidays to you as well. And three quarters ago in our Analyst Day, we communicated kind of the new way that we were looking at SG&A, which is SG&A as a percent of gross margin or gross profit dollars, as we believe that's much more reflective of how we actually run the business, and more reflective of our efficiency, because we are investing not only in our used car business, but we're investing in technology and platforms and resources to grow our wholesale business, which certainly we've seen so far this year, and certainly this quarter, as well as our CAF business. So we're investing across the board. So if you take a look at SG&A as a percent of gross profit, that's kind of how we manage the business. And, year-to-date, we've leveraged that by 300 basis points. And our intent is that we will leverage this year, when it comes to SG&A, and our plan is to leverage that into the fourth quarter as well. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Thank you. And then a follow-up question on new car pricing. I mean, there's a lot of debate amongst investors on how much companies such as yourself are benefiting from used car prices. So, is there any way to disaggregate what you think the benefit is, particularly maybe in wholesale GPU from prices, as opposed to the initiatives that you've done that have increased the appraisal volume in general from the online arena? Bill Nash : Yeah, Sharon. When I think about used car prices, on one side, it's a bit of a headwind, on another side it's a bit of a tailwind. I think, you've hit the area where I think it's more of a tailwind, which is wholesale. So anytime used price valuation goes up, that's a good thing for organizations are buying cars, and certainly it\u2019s a good thing for us. As I think about the wholesale growth or just our growth and self-sufficiency in totality, I would still go back to that we believe that the majority of that growth is really a result of some of the innovations, things like instant appraisal, the instant offer that we have on for appraisals, I think that's driving the majority of the growth. Because even if I go back to the first quarter where we didn't see it was prior to kind of this continued ramp up and valuations, we saw a huge increase in wholesale and just overall buy. So while it is hard to your point to disaggregate the two, I think we believe that the majority of the increase is driven by things that we're doing internally. Sharon Zackfia : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Your line is open. Rick Nelson : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Nice quarter. I\u2019d like to follow-up on me online penetration, it was 9% up from 5% a year ago, but yet, that stayed stable sequentially. Any thoughts on why we didn't see that grow sequentially? Bill Nash : Yeah. Good morning, Rick. It was up a little bit. But you're right, it was fairly a small increase from the last quarter. And, as I think about it, one of the reasons that we got our self-progression up to about two-thirds was because we added some functionality to the trades that don't have liens. And we added that more to the latter part of the quarter last year. And I think what we're really seeing is we're giving customers options to do different things.  So while they may think, okay, I'm going to do an online sale, as I said in my opening remarks, some people are still -- they're coming in and wanting to deliver in the store, they want to do a couple things in the store. So I think a big driver is just options. We give consumers options and so they may think they're going to do one thing, and they actually take a different path, which that's what we're all about.  We don't care which way a consumer wants to buy or how they want it delivered, we just want to make sure that we're giving them the most personalized experience. I'd expect to see this percent continue to go up. But again, it's going to be more driven by the customer's behaviors than us forcing anybody to go one way or the other. Rick Nelson : Okay. Thanks, Bill. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning and happy holidays. My question has to do with affordability. With your ASPs up over $6,000 to more than $28,000, are you seeing the high prices crowd out, any segment of your customer base, especially among your less affluent consumers? Bill Nash : Yeah. So, Craig, I think this goes back to a little bit of Sharon's question where I said, we've got some headwinds, we've got some tailwind. When you think about ASPs, the tailwind is more on the wholesale. The headwind, I think there is a little bit of a headwind on the retail side. While you're benefiting from less new cars that are out there so you\u2019re probably getting some new car customers that are looking for higher selection, the fact that the price is up. I think that does pinch some consumers out especially at the lower end of the credit spectrum, it could make it more difficult for them. This is also the reason why we stay very focused on trying to make sure we can continue to pass along efficiencies to customers, just to make sure that we can give them as good a deal as possible, which, again, is why we took a lot of our self-sufficiency gains and put it through in prices. Jon Daniels : Yeah, Craig, and I'll just accentuate that comment, I made my prepared remarks. I think this makes us feel all the more better given the ASPs on our 95% plus approval rate on those that did come through the door. And our lending platform and our lenders down in that space still able to provide strong quality offers. So certainly, recognize it can be a challenge down there, but we feel like we have the credit to provide those customers. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Aileen Smith : Good morning, everyone. This is Aileen Smith on for John. I wanted to ask a question and circle back to one of the targets that you provided at your Analyst Day back in May, which was to sell 2 million vehicles per year by 2026 across the retail and wholesale channels. At the time, your volume levers were closer to the 1.2 range. But based on where 4Q lands, you're probably going to be close to 1.6, 1.7 for this year, which is impressive. So first question relative to when you provided that outlook six months ago, what segment of the business has been performing perhaps better than expectations? Retail or wholesale? And second, what factors would you attribute to this, more so increasing inventory through sourcing efforts or making progress with your customers on omni-channel or other offerings? Bill Nash : Yeah, so the way I think about it is, we've been pleasantly surprised by some of innovations. We expected to increase sales, both wholesale and retail, and which is why we set the goal out there. Obviously, wholesale has been very strong, but so is retail, top-line retail has been strong as well. So we're very pleased. And, I think it's a little too early. We just put those targets out there, not that long ago, but we'll be reviewing those targets probably later on in the year after the year-end and potentially updating. But I think it's a little early at this point. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah, I would agree with that. And I think, we've said on our previous calls, our performance and our instant offer has really exceeded our expectations. We put that product out really in the first quarter and it just has taken off. It's resonated with our consumers, it's resonated with the marketplace. And that has really driven a good part of our business through self-sufficiency, but also driving wholesale business as well.  So that has exceeded our expectations. And it's gotten -- our instant offer program has gotten stronger every single quarter. So second quarter was stronger than the first, third quarter was stronger than the second. So it seems to be building momentum out there in the marketplace. Aileen Smith : Great. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Bill Nash : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Rajat Gupta : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on just the labor and capacity situation today. How comfortable are you with the pace of hiring and the level of staffing that you have at your stores, just to serve the demand that is to come in the near to medium-term? And I had a follow-up? Bill Nash : Yeah, we feel, like I said in my prepared remarks, we feel great about the momentum both in inventory and staffing. If I look at staffing, just for the quarter, we hired more than 2,000 associates. And obviously the majority of those are in the field and the customer experience center. So we're on a good trend there. We\u2019re a little wide where we'd like to be and also this is a time of year where we start to ramp up for the traditional tax season.  But we feel great about that. We also feel great about our ability to produce cars. As I said earlier, we're sequentially building every single month and we've continued that trend early into this fourth quarter. We're very confident that we can get both to where we need that we've got the resources and the wherewithal to take care of both. Rajat Gupta : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just kind of follow-up on CAF, you\u2019ve increased your Tier 2, Tier 3 mix within CAF over the last few quarters. And if I compare it to two years ago, it looks like your third-party Tier 2 mix is also higher, whereas you've also increased the Tier 2 mix within CAF. So just curious as to like, what's changing in your overall customer base in general? Is there like a more permanent shift taking towards maturity on three months? Or, is this just more a one-time thing, just curious how that's going to change and how that impacts the business? Jon Daniels : Yeah, appreciate the question. Yeah, so within the Tier 2 percentage, obviously, you saw that that went up within the quarter. A couple things going on there, penetration or the amount of sales that a Tier or a lender will take is certainly a function of those that are applying for credit.  We did mention that there was less volume down in the lower kind of subprime space, that'll take volume from Tier 3. But I think also very important of note is that the credit offers from our Tier 2 lenders has been spectacular, and they're probably pulling some volume up out of Tier 3, which is positive, obviously, from a participation standpoint. So that\u2019s strong. Obviously, you did recognize the CAF is in the Tier 2 space as well, so we're taking some volume there. But I think the combination of the credit quality that are applying, and then the Tier 2 strength of offers is what's changing in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Nice quarter. Congratulations. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Brian Nagel : So the question I want to ask, probably a bit of a follow-up some of the prior questions. But look, there was definitely a nice acceleration in the used car business from fiscal Q2 to fiscal Q3. Bill, you talked in your prepared comments about and in some of the responses to questions about the inventory, maybe the inventory constraints lighten up. I guess my question is, how should we really think about this acceleration? What were the key factors behind it? And was it more supply more demand driven? And then, I recognize you don't give guidance. How should we consider maybe its sustainability what we're seeing in the business at least as of the end of Q3? Bill Nash : Yeah. So Brian, thank you for the question. First of all, I got to give a shout out to the team because they've done just a phenomenal job from an execution standpoint, taking advantage of the opportunities. Like I did say, I think the fact that we have been light in inventory, especially in the second quarter, and how we've continued to work through that, I think that's a big factor.  I think the staffing is another big factor, because we're understaffed in the stores and our customer experience centers. We continue to make enhancements on our omni-channel experience. If I think about just year-over-year, online and omni-channel this year was roughly, let's call it 66% of sales, a year ago it was 53% of the sales. I think passing along efficiencies in pricing, last quarter was really the first quarter that we had seen self-sufficiency above 70%. And we saw that continued through this quarter being able to pass those savings along I think were also a good thing. So I think there's a lot that's playing into, and it's really hard to say, okay, well, this piece of it or that piece. We felt great about the quarter, they were strong every month in the quarter. And you're right, we don't give guidance. But I'll tell you, we're pleased with the start of the fourth quarter. Brian Nagel : Perfect. And then if I could follow-up to that as we think about the business, what constraints are still in place? Is it inventory, labor, other things? And then how should we think about those constraints abating again, and just over the next say few months or whatever? Bill Nash : Yeah, I think you hit labor, I think labor is one that we'll continue to focus on. While we've made great progress, we want to hire some more folks there. And that's pretty much across the whole organization. So I think that's another one that we're continue to focus on making great progress, as well as inventory. We'll continue to build out inventory. But like I said earlier, I think we have the resources and we are on the right path to make sure that we'll be able to get our inventory to where it needs to be in time for any type of tax time sales. And I'll tell you the other thing is if I look over the next year, we're also -- as part of our planned growth we have roughly let's call it 10 new production centers opening up, some of them are part of geo, some of them are part of the expansion plans that we'd already started. So we've got the resources we need and we're on a good trajectory. But those are I think shorter-term focuses for us certainly. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Brian, what I would add to that is between the improvements in staffing and certainly the physical capacity that we have today and moving forward. What I\u2019d tell you is that, we have a strong belief that we are operationally strong and ready for growth. So we are well-positioned. Brian Nagel : Got it. Congrats again. Thank you. Happy holidays. Enrique Mayor-Mora: You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My first question is regarding the self-sufficiency ratio, which was again up over 70% this quarter, second time in a row. But this quarter, we saw your retail unit comps really accelerate and your GPU be much stronger year-over-year than last quarter. Can you help us understand the dynamics that are driving those big changes from one quarter to the next? Bill Nash : Yeah, I think I spoke a little bit about the comps and all the factors that kind of drove that in there. I mean, obviously, the self-sufficiency is at a high for entire second quarter. We were able to pass those efficiencies along. And like I said in my prepared remarks, what we're trying to do is walk a fine balance here. We know prices are up 30% for us, we know that puts pressure for some customer. So we're really trying to make the vehicles as affordable as possible. We'll continue this quarter, just like we did last quarter, we continue to look at inventory levels, test elasticity, check competitors inventory, there's a lot of things that go into this. But I do think we struck the right balance, both from a margin standpoint, kind of coming in historically high. If you look at recent margin ranges for the last few years, I think we came in high on that. But still, we're able to pass along some great efficiencies to the consumers. Seth Basham : Right. Just to follow-up, last quarter we didn't see as much improvement in GPU or comp. Is the delta between last quarter and this quarter, therefore due to market forces, such as the difference between market retail and wholesale prices? Or is there something else? Bill Nash : Well, I think this is -- last quarter was the first time we'd really achieved self-sufficiency over 70%. And what we did realize last quarter, we pretty much were passing along. What I\u2019d tell you is, if you look at the market, and we don't talk about market here till the end of the year, because there's definitely a lag and you have to look at it on a calendar year basis due to that lag. But, some of the external sources are out there that will tell you that the use car just overall market is either flat or maybe even negative in the last few months. And we think that bodes well for the gains that we're starting to see. So, I think what you're really seeing here is you're seeing a combination of a whole bunch of things that are really kind of came to fruition. Like I talked about all the different things for comp, but I think what you're starting to see there's just a lot of factors that really played in on the third quarter results. Seth Basham : Good to see. Thanks, congrats and happy holidays. Bill Nash : Thanks, Seth. You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Bill Nash : Thank you, Michael. Michael Montani : Just wanted to clarify one thing and then had a question on provisioning. But from a clarification standpoint, into the fourth quarter Enrique, just want to make sure I heard you correctly that you all would look to potentially lever to SG&A to gross ratio in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to clarify that first of all, and then I had follow-up. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. No, that's what I said. Our intent is to lever into the fourth quarter. Michael Montani : Okay, great. And then the follow-up I had was just from a provisioning standpoint, just wanted to understand moving forward, how you all are thinking about basically that line item within CAF? Because obviously, you've got potential for further improvements and unemployment rate and stubbornly high kind of used car prices, which theoretically should help you out. But then there's obviously more Tier 2 that you're doing and so forth. So, now that the reserve has been kind of built up again a little bit, should we think $75 million a quarter more or less, or any color you can provide there would help a lot? Jon Daniels : Yeah. Great question, Michael. Yeah, if we think about the combination of the reserve and the provision exactly as you stated, our reserve right now metrically uses the 2.75% reserve to receivables. Remember, in there is as you stated Tier 1, but also Tier 2, Tier 3 volume and then some expense for recovery there. If you back out that Tier 1 as I mentioned, we feel like we're getting our normal range of 2% to 2.5% for that Tier 1 business. Also if you look at what we originated in the quarter, $2.4 billion, again, recognizing that there's Tier 1, a higher loss of Tier 2 and Tier 3 in that originations, as well as the recovery expense. But $76 million feels very much close to normal for that size of origination. So I think you're right on the mark here. It's something we feel like we\u2019re at a normal percentage from a loss rate perspective and I would think about that going forward. And one thing I'll point out as a reminder, again, the provision was substantial at the height of the pandemic, a $122 million done back in quarter one of FY \u201821. And as we saw performance improved, really fantastic performance from our consumers, we were able to reduce that provision over time. So the fact that we comped over last year's quarter three is fantastic. So we realize we've still got that comping to do. But yes, agree, we're in a normal environment right now. Michael Montani : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. Happy holidays. So would love to know how online looks on GPU versus the $2,235. Is it higher or lower than that? And as a follow-up, you mentioned, the vast majority of your customers still prefer pickup in store within the online label. I'm curious if you can tell us how many, or what portion of the 9% did opt for home delivery? Thanks. Bill Nash : Okay. So on your first question, online GPU, it's the same as in the in store. It doesn't matter if you buy it online or in store, the GPU is relatively the same. As far as the 9% online sales, the way we think about it is we speak to it more alternative delivery, which is includes home delivery as well as express pickup. And when I think about that, that percent of just total sales, obviously, is less than 10%, with the bulk of it being more express pickups where the customers come into the store, they've already filled out everything and maybe one or two little things to do, but we get them in and out and very quickly. So, that's the bigger share versus the home delivery. Adam Jonas : Yeah. I didn't know if you want to specify that. You did say vast majority, I just didn't know if it was 90% of the 9% or 70% of the 9% just for home delivery. Bill Nash : For home delivery, it's a much smaller percent of that. Adam Jonas : Alright, we'll leave it there. Thanks, Bill. Bill Nash : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I just had a quick follow-up on the credit, and then have another credit question. So the first one, it sounds like in response to Mike's question, like Michael Montani's question earlier, like there was no impact, I mean, the system's impact. You seem to imply there is some kind of impact on gross losses recovery, but then said like it wasn't having to provision. So I\u2019m just trying to triangulate those two, like was there any impact on gross losses recovery this quarter? Or is it more like just on the overhead expense? Jon Daniels : Yeah, fair question, Chris. Yeah, as I said in my prepared remarks, a big systems change a lot of -- a fair amount of disruption that we are fully expecting and planned for. But as we've come online and caught up with the volumes, we've seen those delinquencies trend down to more normal levels, but absolutely no impact. And we believe it's immaterial on the full lifetime loss of the portfolio. And so that's obviously nothing in there in the provision and the corresponding reserve. Bill Nash : Yeah, just to add on that, Chris. It was immaterial last quarter and anticipation of it, it was immaterial again this quarter. Chris Bottiglieri : That\u2019s helpful. Okay. And then just bigger picture question. Can you elaborate more on the lower rates on new loans this quarter, compared to last quarter? And you mentioned, like kind of rate testing, your peer made a -- a large online peer made a similar comment last quarter. Just timing feels a little bit unusual to the experiment cutting rates, and we're actually seeing the inverse happening where the markets raising rates now, in terms of like the Tier rates.  So I guess, like, first question is with that backdrop, have you found customers historically become more rate sensitive when rates rise? And is that the motivation for testing? And then like, just using some kind of historical precedent how should we think about the impact on rates to customers in periods where funding costs go up? Like how big of a lag is there between passing those rate increases through? Jon Daniels : Yeah, great questions, Chris. Yeah, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, yes, we did execute some rate testing this quarter. It's what we do, we're always trying to keep an eye on what the market is doing. We can Look at a number of metrics internally, again, our capture rate or our booking rate, which results in our penetration, three day payoffs, a number of metrics we can keep an eye on. But most importantly for CAF is as the sole Tier 1 lender, we want to be highly competitive for our customers, provide the best possible offers we can. So it made sense. We just wanted to get the pulse of the market. We did some rate testing, and we're watching that very carefully. As you mentioned, certainly the Fed did come out and signal that there's going to be rate increases in the future. Again, we'll manage that as we always do. We'll look at what the peers do, how the market reacts often in a rising rate environment. To your point, you will see a lag there, it won't get passed along to the customer right away.  We're not looking to get out in front of that. We'll again remain highly competitive in our rates. And we will test as we always do accordingly, we will watch how the market is moving, what those take rates are. And then if it makes sense to pass along to the customers, we will. But if it impacts sales to cars, or the experience or our CAF capture rate, then we may not. So the testing will drive what we do. Bill Nash : Yeah, and I think the great thing about CAF, Chris is that they're not just focused on maximizing their own profit. The beauty is they're working on profit, but they're also working to help maximize sales. So our decisions may sometimes vary from other players that are just purely in the finance arena. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. It makes sense. Thanks for the help, appreciate it. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. David Bellinger : Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask nearly 200,000 vehicles sourced from consumers through the instant appraisal. Can we get a sense of just how many offers you're making each quarter? Is the conversion rate improving sequentially? And given all the data you're now armed within deploying more effectively, are you seeing better engagement or even repeat activity from past customers? Bill Nash : Yeah. Good morning, David. On the Online offers, as you can imagine, we make a lot of online offers. Some of the customers are just really shopping for their value, and they're not really interested in selling or even buying a car. So, we're making a couple million offers a year. As I think about the conversion, really the way we've talked about it in the past is, the customers show up at our store they are there to get their vehicle appraise, whether they haven't had it appraised online, or whether they have had it appraised online. We look at the buy rate from that standpoint. So if I look at the traditional appraisal lane, where a customer hasn't had it appraised online, we're really seeing mid 30 buy rate, which is great. On the online side, as you can imagine if they've already had their vehicle valued online and they're showing up at the store, then that certainly is going to be a higher buy rate. So it pulls the overall by rate up. But I think, I don't think we should look at it necessarily, as of the ones that have offers, how many of them actually sold. We do see some good improvement there. But that's not really how we think about the business. David Bellinger : Got it. And anything on the repeat activity, you see more engagement from past customers in terms of the instant appraisal. Bill Nash : You know what, David, I'd have to go back and look and see how many of them are customers that have had an appraised price. I don't have that number off the top of my head. David Bellinger : Okay. Well, thanks for the call. I appreciate it, Bill. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m curious if you don't mind looking forward ahead in the future a bit. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on as the chip shortage improves a new vehicle inventory over the say the next 18-months. Will that cause use pricing to crash kind of hard and abruptly? Or do you see a soft landing? And if you see a harder landing, are you worried about your customers perhaps having too much negative equity that they may stay out of the store and stay out of the market in \u201823? Bill Nash : Yeah, it's a tough question to really gauge when I think the chip shortage will kind of correct itself. I mean, whatever I tell you is probably going to be wrong. What I believe will be we'll start to see some relief maybe latter part of next year. I think it's not going to be like a faucet that just automatically turns on overnight. So as more chips are available, more new cars are available, you'll start to see the impact on used vehicle prices. I think, anytime sales prices are up 30% year-over-year, I think there is a risk that down the road, there could be some more negative equity out there. But I can tell you we've been in business a long time, we've been through a lot of cycles up and down. And we've proven that we can work through any such factors, whether it be negative equity, whether it be depreciation in the marketplace. And I would actually tell you, I think we are able to handle that and do a much better job than anybody else just given our experience. So stay tuned. It's hard to know when we'll get some relief on just overall used car prices. And just one other thing on the previous David's question while on the IO the team here informed me I misspoke. It's actually, I think what I said was a couple million dollars a year, it's actually a couple million per quarter. I misspoke. I meant to say quarter versus year. So I just wanted to clarify that for him as well. David Whiston : Okay. And you talked about mitigating negative equity, is it possible to CAF can be more aggressive in a negative equity situation? Jon Daniels : I don't think that we're going to necessarily adjust our underwriting given a particular situation of where ASPs are and negative equity and all that. Again, all in all, CAF being the captive lender, a great environment to always think about sales and capture that in our decisions. But again, we want to underwrite a strong credit customer. We're going to be ABS market, we need a solid book of business. So, I just think we are very focused on delivering sales and credit quality. Bill Nash : Yeah. And we deal with negative equity customers all the time. The CAF team does a phenomenal job there, just like our third-party lenders do. David Whiston : Okay. Thanks. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we don't have any further questions. At this time, I'll hand the call back to Bill, for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you all for joining the call today and your questions and your support. As I said earlier, we're really excited about the opportunities in front of us. And as I always do, I want to thank all of our associates for everything that they do, how they take care of each other and our customers. They are really the reason for our success and why we remain such a positive disruptive force in the used car industry. So I wish all of our associates and all of you a happy holiday season, and we'll talk again next quarter. Thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. For the fourth quarter of FY \u201822, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, up 49% compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter, driven by growth in average selling prices and wholesale volume gains partially offset by a decline in used units sold. Net earnings was $159.8 million for the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.98, down 23% from a year ago. During our call in December, we shared that we were pleased with our sales performance at the start of the fourth quarter. However, we began to see pressure after the holidays that continued through the end of the quarter. In our retail business, total unit sales in the fourth quarter declined 5.2% and used unit comps were down 6.5% versus the fourth quarter last year. We believe several macro factors weighed on market-wide used car sales, including consumer confidence, vehicle affordability, the Omicron COVID surge and lapping stimulus benefits paid in the prior year period. While the fourth quarter used market was challenging, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments for fiscal 2022 and we believe we are well positioned for continued long-term success across our retail and wholesale business and CarMax Auto Finance. Our full year results reflect significant growth in sales, market share and earnings as well as a solid progress on our strategic initiatives. In fact, our retail market share growth this past year was the highest it\u2019s been during my tenure as CEO and is a reflection of our focus on delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry. Our market share data indicates that our nationwide share of 0 to 10-year-old vehicles grew 13% from 3.5% in calendar 2020 to 4.0% in 2021. Despite posting a decline in sales during our fiscal fourth quarter, comparing our results to published used vehicle SAAR data suggest that we continued to take share during the quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver profitable market share gains in any environment. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 343,000 cars in total during the fourth quarter, up 11% versus last year\u2019s period. For the fiscal year, we sold approximately 1.6 million retail and wholesale cars combined, up 38% year-over-year. We continue to be the nation\u2019s largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 324,000 cars from consumers during the quarter, up 69% versus last year\u2019s period. For the fiscal year, we bought approximately 1.4 million cars from consumers, up 95% year-over-year. Self-sufficiency continued to be strong during the fourth quarter, remaining above 70%. We reported fourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $2,195, up $109 per unit versus the prior year period. With used car prices remaining elevated, we chose to pass along some of our self-efficiency acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between covering inflationary cost, maintaining margin and keeping our vehicles more affordable. Our approach reflects our continuation of our commitment to doing what\u2019s right for the customer, which ultimately drives the growth of our business. Wholesale unit sales were up 43.8% from the fourth quarter last year and gross profit per unit was $1,191 compared to $990 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. Wholesale valuations remained historically high during the quarter, which supported margin relative to the fourth quarter last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $194 million, up from $188 million during the same period last year. In a few minutes, John will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions, but at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. Total gross profit was $711 million, up 11% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This increase was driven primarily by wholesale vehicle margin of $177 million, which was up 73%. The continued growth of the wholesale business is providing us with a strong gross profit lever. Used vehicle margin of $427 million was relatively flat over last year\u2019s fourth quarter, with the decrease in units largely offset by an increase in margin per unit. Other gross profit was $107 million, down 4% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This decrease reflected a $33 million decline in service profit primarily due to the deleverage driven by the reduction in sales and the staffing and efficiency impacts from the Omicron COVID surge in the fourth quarter. Our intent continues to be to operate service-as-a-profit center, which from quarter-to-quarter can be impacted by sales trends and staffing disruptions. Partially offsetting this decline was favorability in EPP and third-party finance fees as well as $20 million of margin contribution from admins. EPP grew by $6.3 million or 5% year-over-year for the quarter, with penetration stable at approximately 60%. This favorability was driven by an $11 million year-over-year net benefit from the recognition of profit sharing revenues and adjustments to our cancellation reserves. Recall from our second quarter call in September, one of our providers implemented a timing shift in their performance period for profit sharing revenues. All of our providers now utilize the same timing, which aligns recognition as applicable to our fourth quarter. Third-party finance fees improved by $4.7 million, with income of $1.8 million compared to a cost of $2.9 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter. On the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter increased to $621 million, up 23% from the prior year\u2019s quarter due to continued investment in our strategic initiatives and in marketing, the consolidation of Edmunds and growth costs related to the increase in appraisal buys, new stores and customer support at our customer experience centers or CECs. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 87.3% from 79% during the fourth quarter last year. This deleverage was primarily due to the decline in sales that occurred in the quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to three factors. First, a $43 million increase in total compensation and benefits driven by our continued strong ramp in staffing, including proactive staffing in anticipation of tax season and wage increases. Additionally, we had a $16 million increase in annual bonus-related compensation plus the inclusion of admin\u2019s payroll this quarter versus a year ago. Partially offsetting this increase was a $42 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Second, a $40 million increase in other overhead. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives as well as growth-related costs. Third, a $19 million increase in advertising expense through our ongoing plan to drive customer acquisition and amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omnichannel offerings. For the full year, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.7%, leveraging approximately 1 point over last year\u2019s percentage of 71.6%. Our approach to SG&A and costs heading into next year remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend and we continue to target areas of focus that we expect will deliver results over time. We expect to require an increase beyond the 5% to 8% range of gross profit growth to lever in FY \u201823. This is largely driven by the timing of strategic investments and growth-related costs as well as heightened inflationary pressures. While we expect to remain in investment mode over the next few years, we expect our leverage point to go back down after FY \u201823. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our core business, consider new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships or acquisitions and returned excess capital to our shareholders. In regard to our share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 872,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $102 million. For the full year, we have repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares for $561.6 million, and as of March 31, 2022, we had $721.7 million of authorizations remaining. As communicated today, our Board of Directors has expanded our share repurchase authority by $2 billion with no expiration timeline. The Board\u2019s authorization reflects CarMax\u2019s ongoing commitment to long-term shareholder value creation through growth and return of capital. For capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $500 million in FY \u201823. This increase in spend is driven by long-term growth capacity initiatives for our auction, sales and production facilities in addition to continued investments in technology. In FY \u201823, we plan to open 10 new locations, including our first 3 stores in the New York City metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax, and we remain committed to an appropriate level of investment on these differentiated assets. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique and good morning everyone. Our CarMax Auto Finance business delivered strong results once again. For the fourth quarter, CAF\u2019s penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 41% compared with 43.5% last year. Tier 2 increased to 23.7% of used unit sales compared with 21% last year, and Tier 3 accounted for 6.7% of sales compared with 9.5% a year ago. Year-over-year reduction in CAF\u2019s penetration is attributed to a larger percentage of customers coming in with outside financing. Our Tier 2 partners continue to provide highly competitive credit offers as they compete for additional volume within the Max channel. These strong offers, along with the decrease in conversion in the lower portion of the credit spectrum driven by higher average selling prices and corresponding monthly payments, contributed to the swap and penetration between Tiers 2 and 3. During this year\u2019s fourth quarter, CAF\u2019s net loans originated was nearly $2.1 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.2%, down from 8.5% a year ago and 8.3% in the third quarter. The difference in EPR is primarily a result of the credit mix of customers booking with CAF. CAF income for the quarter was $194 million, an increase of 3% or $6 million from the same period last year. Total interest margin increased $64 million, driven by $42 million in higher interest and fee income from our continued growth in receivables and $22 million in lower interest expense from the past ABS deals that continue to provide value over time. This improvement in CAF\u2019s margin and the growth in average managed receivables more than offset a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses, which was a more normalized $54.4 million in the current year\u2019s fourth quarter versus $4.6 million in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. In the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, the provision for loan losses benefited from the continued reduction in the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic. The current quarter\u2019s provision of $54 million resulted in an ending reserve balance of $433 million or 2.77% of managed receivables. This is largely consistent with the 2.75% at the end of the third quarter and includes a 3 basis point adjustment for additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume originated by CAF. I also want to take the opportunity to highlight a few of the accomplishments made since our last call regarding our online finance experience. As a reminder, nearly 2/3 of our customers begin their financing process on carmax.com, applying on any vehicle in our inventory or simply a requested dollar amount. Our unique finance-based shopping engine, available to most of our customers, allows for multiple lenders to decision a single customer or co-applicants on our entire inventory to provide a full suite of personalized decisions available at the consumer\u2019s fingertips. This tool is incorporated into the search page within carmax.com, allowing the user to sort and filter not only on the vehicles characteristics, but also on important finance terms such as monthly payment and down payment. During the month of March, we further enhanced this experience and are now testing a no-impact-to-your-credit-score feature, along with the streamlined application process that provides real-time credit decisions on our full inventory. We believe that our differentiated multi-lender platform, coupled with these and additional enhancements that are on the horizon, will further strengthen our digital shopping experience. Now, I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. As I mentioned earlier in this call, I am very proud of how we performed in fiscal 2022. We bought and sold more vehicles than ever before through our retail and wholesale platforms. We\u2019ve continued to innovate, to aggressively invest in core areas of our business and to pursue new growth opportunities. As a result of these efforts, we\u2019ve achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in our market share, and we believe we are well positioned to take even more share. We have continued to build out new and enhanced capabilities, and as those capabilities have come to market, we have continued to see positive returns. Some highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact are, first, enabling online self-progression capabilities currently available to approximately 90% of our customers with full availability for every customer anticipated by the end of this first quarter. Next, leveraging our online instant appraisal offering to buy a record number of cars directly from consumers, which enable us to nearly double our self-sufficiency as we drive \u2013 as well as drive sustainable wholesale unit growth. Also, transitioning CAF\u2019s legacy auto loan receivable servicing system to brand new technology, which provides CAF a modernized foundation for growth and allows us to enhance our customer experience. And finally, rolling out the finance-based shopping capabilities that Jon just described, our e-commerce engine, combined with our unparalleled nationwide physical footprint, is a key value to our customers and helps us provide what we believe is the best experience in the used car industry. Our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market and is a key differentiator, one that we will continue to enhance. In regard to our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from prior year\u2019s quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%. This is up from 17% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 51% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. In the fourth quarter, we bought approximately 162,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal. That represents about half of our total buys from consumers. This fiscal year, we bought approximately 707,000 cars through this channel, again, representing roughly half of our total buys from consumers. Going forward, we will continue to evolve our online and in-store capabilities to enable a more seamless experience for our associates and customers. I would like to highlight 4 key areas of focus for FY \u201823. First, as John mentioned earlier, we are deploying a more sophisticated version of our finance-based shopping capability that enables real-time decisions and offers our customers the ability to pre-qualify for a loan with no impact to their credit score. Second, adding self-service capabilities to enhance in-store interactions, including appraisals and express pickups. Third, growing vehicle acquisition through attracting new customers and pursuing partnerships as we expand our appraisal offering to dealers and other businesses. And finally, continuing to leverage data science, automation and AI to improve efficiencies and effectiveness across our buying organization, business offices and CEC. Again, we are very proud of the strong results for fiscal \u201822 as they are in large part due to our relentless focus to provide our customers the best experience in the industry. We are in a strong position moving forward, and we will continue to invest and innovate to achieve profitable market share growth. During our Analyst Day last May, we announced long-term targets of achieving 2 million combined retail and wholesale units sold and $33 billion of revenue in FY \u201826, up from $1.2 million and $19 billion, respectively, during FY \u201821. Though we don\u2019t anticipate updating our targets annually, our strong performance in FY \u201822 has given us a new perspective on these targets that we believe is appropriate to share at this time. We\u2019re revising our FY \u201826 targets to reflect a range of 2 million to 2.4 million combined units with revenue between $33 billion and $45 billion. These ranges reflect the macro factors we had earlier that could result in ongoing volatility in consumer demand and vehicle pricing. In regard to market share, I\u2019m excited for the future and confident that we will expand it beyond 5% by the end of calendar 2025. Last, but most importantly, I want to thank all of our associates for the work that they do. They are truly the keys to our success. Just yesterday, Fortune Magazine named CarMax as one of its 100 Best Companies to Work For for the 18th year in a row. I\u2019m incredibly proud of this recognition as it is due to our associates\u2019 commitment to supporting each other, our customers and our communities every day. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I\u2019m curious about the online instant appraisal tool. Just a number of questions about that. How would you assess your competitive positioning and the competitive landscape in that market? How are you different? Are you putting enough marketing spend behind that effort while you have this competitive advantage? And then Bill, I think you mentioned plans for fiscal 2023 to roll this out to other dealers. Maybe you could shed some light on that? Bill Nash : Sure. Good morning, Craig. There is a lot in that question. So first of all, I feel really great about our IO success. I think it\u2019s really been so successful because of a bunch of reasons. One, I think it\u2019s really the experience and the ease of use of the product. I think it also has the backing and the brand recognition of CarMax, and I mean, let\u2019s not forget, this is what we do. We\u2019ve been buying cars from consumers since 1993. We have started advertising, obviously, for it. If I look at the fourth quarter and think about our advertising spend, we break it down between kind of brand awareness and acquisition awareness. I would tell you. The acquisition awareness, we spent a little bit more on vehicle acquisition awareness this past quarter than we have in previous quarters, so we feel good about the advertising. Now I think, obviously, I think everybody in the marketplace is benefiting a little bit from higher valuations, but I think that\u2019s the minority of the bump that we\u2019ve seen, so we\u2019re excited about that. As far as my comments earlier, yes, look, first of all, we\u2019re going to continue to improve that experience for our consumers. But we\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019ve been testing and we will continue to roll this out to make it available to other dealers. It\u2019s an easy way to get rid of inventory that they are looking to get rid of as well as we will look for other partnerships where we can leverage this. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Sharon Zackfia : Thanks for all the color on the long-term plans. I\u2019m sure everyone is interested in kind of how you can pivot in the current consumer environment, particularly with used car prices where they are. And you talked a little bit about kind of passing on some better prices to consumers in this quarter, but I\u2019m wondering. First, I guess, if you have any kind of additional insight on how much stimulus might have benefited you in the year ago period, both in the fourth quarter and in March now that you\u2019ve lapped that? If there was any distinct Omicron impact that was isolated to the fourth quarter? I think that would be helpful to know. And then just given where gas prices are and used car prices, are you seeing any kind of falloff in demand for SUVs? How are you pivoting for that? And then are you shipping average age of your inventory somewhat older to try to make the price points more affordable? I know there is a lot there, but I think it\u2019s important to kind of cover all of that, sorry. It\u2019s like a 12-part, one-part question. Bill Nash : Yes. That\u2019s a creative way to get like 14 questions into the first one. But look, I\u2019m happy to take all of them. So let me start, first of all, just on your \u2013 the last two, the gas prices. Look, for the quarter, we really didn\u2019t see much of an impact on gas prices as far as a shift. If I look at gas guzzlers from a sales standpoint, very similar year-over-year. So I do think that\u2019s an area that we need to continue to monitor as we go forward. We have seen an uptick, for example, in things like EV searches, and Edmunds has seen that as well. But we\u2019ve certainly navigated that before and been very successful as consumers want something different. We\u2019re right there for them. So I\u2019m really not worried about that, and we will be able to pivot on that. Your question on average age of vehicles, we did \u2013 from a retail standpoint, we did see a shift to a little bit older car, which obviously is a little bit cheaper. I think the mix, if I\u2019m looking at 0 to, let\u2019s say, 0 to 4 year-over-year, I think there was about 10 points which changed from that bucket into the little bit higher, maybe the 5 to 7 bucket. So we have seen a little bit of shift there. And again, the beauty of our business is, as we see customers looking for different types of inventory, we make sure we get that inventory out there. So we feel good about that. As far as just commentary around the comps, look, I highlighted a whole bunch of different things that are macro factors that I think are weighing on the overall used car industry. If I had to rank in order of magnitude, and again, this is \u2013 it\u2019s hard to exactly quantify each one. But I would probably say that the high prices are at the top of the list, followed by the COVID surge. We did see a COVID surge in January. And then I think coming out of the COVID surge, I think it kind of transitioned into this whole lower consumer confidence. And then I also think the lapping of the federal stimulus. There was some stimulus came out last December, January time frame, primarily more in January, and then there was even more stimulus coming out in March. So I think \u2013 that certainly weighed in on the quarter. And I think it\u2019s also probably just adding to the softness as we look into the first quarter as well. How did I do it? Did I get all your questions? Sharon Zackfia : Yes, I think so. I will get back in the queue. Thank you. Bill Nash : Alright. Thanks, Sharon. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the SG&A run rate, the $130 million in overhead cost, is that kind of like a good baseline to assume for that particular line item going forward? I\u2019m just curious how does that toggle with any changes on the volume side, given things are a little weaker in the near-term? And then maybe if you could comment on CAF, given like the somewhat worsening affordability environment. How confident are you in terms of being able to pass through any benchmark rate increases or widening in ABS market? How confident you \u2013 in terms of you being able to pass that through to the consumer in this kind of environment? And if you\u2019re not able to do that, how should we think about the implications to the CAF business? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. I\u2019ll let Enrique talk about the SG&A. And then the CAF business, we will let Jon answer that, so. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. So, Rajat, I want to make sure I understood your question. Are you talking specifically about other overhead or just over SG&A as a whole? Rajat Gupta : Other overhead. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. So other overhead this quarter really was it\u2019s a continuation of our investment in our technology spend and also costs related to growth. So you got to keep in mind the tremendous amount of cars that we\u2019re buying through the A lane, to the appraisal lane, as well as an increase in our wholesale business. So I would say that was certainly up this quarter. I would expect it to continue to be up. I think taking a step back, though, in taking a look at overall SG&A and all its components. Heading into next year, we do expect, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to need in excess of the 5% to 8% growth in growth profit in order to lever, and that really has to do with the timing of our investments this year. We were successful in staffing the business up. As you recall at the beginning of the year, we had some staffing challenges and we ramped up that staffing throughout the year, and that will comp into next year. So really, when we look at that higher and 5% to 8% gross profit for next year, it\u2019s driven primarily by that timing of that staffing investments that we need to continue to grow this business. Jon Daniels : Yes. Rajat, I can take the affordability question. Appreciate that question. Yes, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before in the kind of the non-CAF customer, lower credit spectrum customer, certainly, we feel affordability is maybe often price them out of the market. You can see that probably reflected in our Tier 3 percentage of sales. But if you look at the CAF customer, I think there is impact there as well. If I look at kind of the micro aspect here, customer last year was coming in purchasing a $20,000 car, maybe putting $1,000 down. Now they are coming in and they are financing $19,000 in that case, they are coming in and they are borrowing $28,000 and they \u2013 if they saw that same $1,000 down, they are asking for $27,000. CAF has a decision to make, as all lenders do, are they going to let that person borrow that much more money? So there is an affordability question there. I think what we are seeing is, in the case of CAF, and we will speak to our penetration this quarter CAF was not necessarily just allowing someone to borrow that $27,000. Potentially, their income didn\u2019t increase at the same level as their requested amount. So there are other lenders out there that maybe were willing to provide that larger dollar amount, so that did affect our penetration. People are taking longer terms out there. Right now, you see a much higher prevalence of used car loans higher than 72 months. It\u2019s clear, it\u2019s marked year-over-year. CAF actually does not provide a loan greater than 72 months, even though people are trying to manage that affordability through term. That may or may not be the right decision for them, but CAF is exacerbating that. So I think there is a couple of things that affect the penetration and are clear impacts of affordability for the customer. The last thing to your point on rates, we clearly have seen a signaling that rates are going to go up. They have gone up initially. They are going to probably continue to go up this year. The back half of this quarter, CAF actually did do some price testing up. We\u2019ve often shared where we will price test down or up randomly. We did a movement up this quarter. We did see that clearly impact our penetration, but we think it\u2019s the right thing to do as we manage our margin. We think as prices go up, we will continue to do that testing, and we think other lenders will follow in kind or be compressed. So we will pass that along as we see fit. We want to remain highly competitive in the marketplace, but yes, we want to make sure that we\u2019re managing margin as well. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And Rajat, just to expand a little bit on that SG&A. I think it\u2019s important to remember as well that we\u2019re focused on capturing the opportunities in our transforming and fragmented industry, right? So whether it\u2019s the right time to invest for us, and whether there is periods of strong industry performance or more challenged industry performance like we faced in the fourth quarter, our goal is to take profitable market share, which as Bill talked about in his prepared remarks, we do believe in the fourth quarter, despite sales being down that we still have market share in our segment. And again, that is our objective as we continue to move forward, which means we\u2019re going to continue to invest. It\u2019s just a huge opportunity for us, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to continue. Operator : I\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Brian Nagel. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : So the question that we wanted to ask was on the nature of the deceleration in the used car business from fiscal Q3 to fiscal Q4. You talked about the factors previously. How should we think about the factor of declining consumer confidence? When did it come about in Q4? And how should we consider this dynamic into fiscal Q3? Bill Nash : Yes. I think, as I said earlier, consumer confidence was obviously one of the factors. I think we actually \u2013 right after we saw the COVID surge, I think as we\u2019re kind of transitioning out of that, we started to see kind of just lack of consumer confidence. And I think that\u2019s a very similar situation that we\u2019re in right now, just for the reasons that we talked about. From an affordability standpoint, you\u2019ve got interest rates going up. Inflation, you\u2019ve got the Ukraine-Russia war. There is just a lot weighing on the consumer right now. So as far as when that turns around, I don\u2019t know. But again, I think to Enrique\u2019s point earlier, I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to manage this. We\u2019ve managed through cycles like this before, and we think we\u2019re in a position to do it in a way that we can continue to gain market share. Operator : We will go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Healy : Great. Bill, I just wanted to ask kind of a big picture question. You\u2019re talking about affordability kind of being a headwind to the business, which makes sense. Which makes us all kind of realized that with higher rates, maybe values need to come lower. So maybe you could give us your thoughts in terms of the relationship between unit and ASP, and maybe how you think ASPs and the used car market kind of maybe fluctuate over the next 6 to 12 months? And with that, is there still a lot of confidence that you guys are going to protect GP potentially at the expense of same-store sales? And is the $2,100 GP kind of benchmark, in your view, achievable even in a kind of softening used car market where maybe values and what you have in inventory maybe are pressured a little bit? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. First of all, the affordability, while you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a headwind for retail, it\u2019s actually good for wholesale, as you saw our wholesale margins. And I think that\u2019s one of the benefits of having the diversified business because as you saw, our GPU for wholesale was up. I think the unit ASP, if you\u2019d ask me, probably 3 or 4 months ago, I would have said I was hoping later this year, we will see some relief. I\u2019m just not sure. Especially given the war in Ukraine and Russia, I\u2019m not sure new car supply is going to come around later this year, that\u2019s to be determined. I think that\u2019s a big factor that will help mitigate just some of the overall price inflation in both new and used cars. But what I will tell you is, though, to your question about GPU, I think that we\u2019re in a great spot. I mean, if you look at the benefit we\u2019ve got with self-sufficiency, and I talked a little bit about that, we \u2013 everybody is seeing inflationary pressure as well. The nice thing is we have a lever that\u2019s offsetting those inflationary pressures. So if you didn\u2019t have a lever offsetting inflationary pressures, that\u2019s obviously going to be either cutting into your margin or it\u2019s going to be raising your average selling prices. And then we still have benefit left over beyond that to pass along to the retail consumers. And I think our self-sufficiency benefits are still kind of maturing. I think there is more potential there and how we manage that and how we do our offers, that kind of thing. So as I think about the future, even if you get into a depreciating environment, which we have shown over time in a depreciating environment, we are still able to maintain very consistent GPUs. I think with self-sufficiency, I think with our diversified business which the CAF profit that can be generated wholesale \u2013 additional wholesale profit that can be generated I think we can maintain very good margins per unit as well as having great retail front prices. So I think we\u2019re well positioned for however the market, if it\u2019s going forward. John Healy : Great. Thank you, guys. Bill Nash : Thanks, John. Operator : We will go next to Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Hey, thanks, guys. Wanted to ask one, just on the tax refund season, I mean, I think they started earlier this year and total dollars paid are actually up. Enrique, I think you mentioned you hired proactively ahead of tax season. So I\u2019m curious, did you guys see the expected pickup maybe in transit as those got paid out? And have the trends you\u2019ve seen as tax refunds got paid out changed your opinion of the underlying health of the consumer kind of as you look for the rest of fiscal \u201823 ahead of us? Bill Nash : Yes, Daniel. I think when I look at the tax season this year, I think it\u2019s very representative of what we saw last year. Now remember, last year, it was a late tax season in comparison to what we normally see. So this year was \u2013 timing was very similar last year. I do think the refunds are a little bit higher this year versus last year. But I think the other complicating factor that you don\u2019t have this year that you had last year was the stimulus that was paid out in January and March, so it\u2019s really hard to decouple all that. I would just go back to my comments on the consumer confidence earlier, which is \u2013 which, I think, is \u2013 regardless of the kind of the tax season, I just think the consumer isn\u2019t as strong a position as they were a year ago. Operator : We will go next to Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hey there. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, if I could, on the capacity front. If you could just bring us up to speed now in terms of some of the incremental hires that you were looking to do and the ability to recondition the vehicles in light of some COVID disruptions, etcetera. Do you feel that you all are kind of appropriately staffed now, able to get kind of the full recon work through that you would have hoped for? So, that was kind of the first question. Bill Nash : Yes. So, we feel great about both our capacity, production capacity and our staffing at this point. Pretty much the whole year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, as I talked about trying to get staffing ramped up, I talked about lower inventory. And coming out of the third quarter, I had made comments. Look, we are well on our way to getting inventory to where we need to be. I don\u2019t think inventory was necessarily a big topic for the fourth quarter. When I look at our inventory levels, I always look at it on a kind of a per average store, and have always been historically, on average, it\u2019s about 320. We are not quite at the 320. But I would tell you, I don\u2019t think it was a big story. I do feel like we have got the capacity we need. We obviously can \u2013 right, currently, we have \u2013 we can build more than 1 million cars a year. And the capital expenditures that Enrique talked about earlier, that\u2019s all part of our natural planning process. As we look out to the future, we already have some production facilities we are working on, but these are additional production facilities. As well as just given the success of our wholesale business, we want to make sure that we can accommodate all the space. So really, it\u2019s just us doing business as we normally do it. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. From a CapEx perspective, we are really just matching our capacity to the longer term demand. And like Bill said, it\u2019s just natural kind of steps we are taking, just being very thoughtful in our approach to capacity expansion to make sure that over time, we can meet the longer term targets that we have set out there. Bill Nash : Yes. I think the only difference in the capital expenditures, which Enrique has called out on a couple of different calls now, is just the stepped-up investment in technology. Just as a bigger percent of our overall CapEx spend. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, it\u2019s actually fairly interesting. And I talked about this on Analyst Day, but if you go back a few years, about 15% of our CapEx spend was on technology. And now that we have been transforming our business, as we look to this year and next year, we are looking at about 30% of our overall CapEx spend is related to technology, so certainly, not in the direction of becoming omni-channel retailer. Michael Montani : And then one of your major competitors did an acquisition in the wholesale channel recently. And I guess what I wanted to do is build on the comment you just made. So, do you feel that given the step-up in CapEx spend towards tech, and then given some of the alternative profit opportunities you have, do you think that there is enough in-house, or is there potentially an opportunity set to kind of bolster the core capabilities inorganically? Bill Nash : Are you talking about from a production capacity? Michael Montani : I think one is just on the wholesale business, right? You guys have done a great job this past year there. Is there an opportunity to potentially grow that platform even faster inorganically? And then also as it relates to the tech side, given the stepped-up investment in CapEx, is that kind of adequate, or potentially, is there some inorganic capabilities that you might be targeting as well? Bill Nash : Yes. No. Look, we feel great about the auction business. As you know, we continue to run that 100% virtual right now. When you think about the CapEx, your auction expense is a lot less than your overall production expense. Because production, you are building out facilities, they are expensive. Auctions you just essentially need space at this point. I mean there is some build out on some larger auction facilities, but \u2013 to hold this inventory. But we feel great about the plans and are very comfortable with how we have been operating, and the fact that we can continue to grow the wholesale business, really, at a quicker pace than just kind of along with the normal growth that it sees when it\u2019s growing as we sell more retail cars. Operator : We will go next to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. There has been a fair amount of talk about market share on this call. And I know you don\u2019t measure market share on a quarterly basis, but in the fiscal fourth quarter, according to CAF, the used vehicle retail saw a decline 4%. Your unit sales on a retail basis declined more than that, so you would have lost market share. Can you please give us some sense as to, is that because you are protecting GPU, or are there other reasons why you might have lost market share in quarter? Bill Nash : Yes, Seth. When we look at market share and even in the fourth quarter, we had great market share growth, and we go off of Pulp data, which is title data. The reason we only look on an annual basis is because it was really like a two-month to three-month lag there. So, we are very confident that we gained not only market share for the whole year, but we gained not only market share for the whole year, but we gained it for the fourth quarter. And as my comment said earlier, we feel really, really good about market share gains in the first quarter despite what\u2019s going on in the macro factors. And when I look at the market share, it doesn\u2019t matter if you break it down zero to 4-year-old cars, 5 years to 7 years, 8 years to 10 years, we got double-digit growth in all those buckets. So, we feel great about it. And the other thing I would point out is that market share growth is primarily \u2013 it\u2019s coming through comps. It\u2019s not like we have opened a whole bunch of new markets, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the market share, which, again, we are excited about. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the CAF business, if you don\u2019t mind. Your loan loss provision was in a normal range, I guess you framed it, Jon. And as you think about the credit environment now and then going forward, we have seen deterioration. But from your perspective, you don\u2019t expect any further deterioration, so there is no need to further increase your loan loss redos going forward? Jon Daniels : Yes. Fair comments, Seth. Yes. No, I would say just point to our reserve-to-receivable ratio steady from last quarter to this quarter, we mentioned we felt like we were kind of returned to pre-pandemic levels. We think we are there. We feel really good about our reserve right now, and we have a good handle on the business. . So, if all things perform as we expect, really, the focal point on the future provision will be on the new originations. And then obviously, there is a mix of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 and the volume we originate, but I think we are pretty steady and in a good spot. Operator : We will move next to Chris Bottiglieri of BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So, first question is on the EPP, obviously, that kind of true up given the change in accrual status. How do we think that for next year? Should we just take like a fourth quarter average and that\u2019s kind of like the new run rate, or is it going to be kind of like this year where it\u2019s Q4 weighted on EPP? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think there are different considerations in EPP, right. The kind of the core business, which is driven by sales and an attach rate from our ESP and EPP products. And then there is a year-end profit sharing that we have with our partners. So, I think on the prior year, I think it\u2019s growing our business, growing our penetration, that will continue to grow. And then the consideration in the fourth quarter this year was that we had more profit sharing revenue than we did last year in the fourth quarter, just our profit sharing was higher. And so given the timing of when we recognize that. If you recall, last year, we actually had one of our partners in profit-sharing revenue that was in the second quarter. They were recognized on a quarterly basis. They have moved in fiscal year \u201822 to an annual basis, so now all of our recognition of profit sharing is in the fourth quarter, which is why we saw a little bit higher this year of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. But taking a look at our business, again, if you take a look at the core sales, you take a look at EPP attachment rates, which has been going really well. We are stable at about 60%, and we would expect that to continue moving forward as well. Bill Nash : Yes. The only other thing I would add to that, Chris, is our goal isn\u2019t to generate a bunch of profit sharing. I mean we want to have these things priced fairly for the consumer. You got some profit sharing, just \u2013 I think it was more driven by people just lack of driving, things like that. But our goal is not to necessarily drive a big revenue recognition at the end of the year. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. A bigger picture question on customer sourcing. So, you talked about the instant appraisal business and growth in customer sourcing, I know it\u2019s difficult to tease out. But based on like the age profile of the vehicle that you are buying from those, how much of this is incremental purchases could come from a private party market as a statement of TAM versus do you think you are coming from other dealers, or indirectly, the cars that would have gone to auction or would have been traded in retail? Is there a way to make sense internally for what \u2013 like how much of the payment growing versus taking share? And lastly, just a perspective on buyer rates, like once you appraise a car, what\u2019s the buy rate is like today versus where it was pre-COVID? Bill Nash : Okay. So, Chris, just on kind of incremental share, we are in the process of developing kind of a buy share that looks at vehicles that originally were with the consumer. The last person that they were was essentially with the consumer, and so we are working on a metric there. We feel great about \u2013 we have certainly increased that by share. We know that, and now we are just trying to be able to quantify it more. So, that\u2019s something we are looking at. But we certainly are comfortable that the bulk of this are coming from other consumers. As far as the buy rate, Historically, the way we talked about buy rate before instant offer was how many people come into the store and ended up getting an appraisal, and then what did we \u2013 what percent of those cars would we actually buy. Then we added the instant online appraisal in the way we buy \u2013 we measure buy rate now is you take \u2013 because we are issuing probably a couple to 3 million instant offers in a quarter, and there is a lot of folks who just kind of shop and to see what their vehicle is worth. So, the way we calculate buy right now is the instant offers when they show up at the store, how much of those actually convert in addition to the traditional way that we looked at it. And we are in the 40% on buy rate. If you look at it the more traditional way that we used to look at it, it\u2019s probably in the low-30%ish, 30%ish. So hopefully, that\u2019s the color that you needed. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, far more complex. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to David Whiston at Morningstar. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning, on CAF penetration, more three-day payoffs. If you were to say fiscal \u201817 or so, it is down, and I am just curious. It looks like, obviously, Tier 2 is taking more business. And is that just an essential thing on your part, or is there something else driving that decline? And then by roughly mid-decade, where do you want your penetration, either gross or net, to be? Jon Daniels : Yes. I appreciate the question, David. Yes, I mentioned in our earlier comments around affordability, let\u2019s just talk about penetration and appreciate you going back to pre-pandemic levels. Historically, Q4 is not going to be one of the highest CAF penetration quarters, obviously being wedged up against tax time. But that being said, it is down, we are losing penetration to outside financing. I mentioned previously, we really believe this is an affordability aspect. People are coming in looking to borrow more money given the ASPs that are out there. As a lender, we have a decision to make, which is, are we going to ask for more money down. We are going to let them borrow that full amount. In some cases, we are not letting them borrow that full amount that they are asking for given the higher ASP, and perhaps there is another lender externally that\u2019s willing to provide that full amount, even though the income maybe not have gone up at the same level. So, we think we are losing in that case. I also mentioned around the longer terms. People are clearly managing affordability to extending that term. That is far more impactful to lowering the monthly payment than any rate adjustment, so we do not provide a greater than a 72-month term on a used loan right now. CAF does not actually impacted CarMax. None of our lenders do. So, we think there are people out there that are absolutely providing that. That\u2019s been shown in the data. So, I think those two things are contributing to penetration. I also mentioned we did price testing up which, again, trying to be in line with where interest rates are headed to manage our margins. So, we did see some impacts there. So, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s changing the actual penetration for this quarter. To your question of where do we want it to be, I think we probably think more about it as we want to be highly competitive. There are ebbs and flows all the time based on what external folks do, but we want to remain highly competitive and provide our higher-end customers an opportunity to finance internally. But that\u2019s what we love about our platform. You can do a three-day payoff. We do have other lenders pick up stuff if we don\u2019t want to extend the full amounts, and we can still sell the car in CarMax. So, I don\u2019t think we are targeting a penetration, and I would expect it to ebb and flow over time, especially as prices come down. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And I think approaching our CAF business that way is really what leads us to have a really strong portfolio of receivables out there and a really strong and consistent performing business in CAF. Bill Nash : Well, and I think it\u2019s also the reason that you want to have also other lenders so that if we keep our portfolio in paper very, very consistent, having other lenders there in CarMax\u2019s camp is a great thing. David Whiston : And let me just clarify something you said. Did you say not only capital, the Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners do not do over 72 months? Jon Daniels : Right now in the CarMax stores or in the CarMax business, we do not offer a used loan greater than 72 months. It\u2019s something that we may or may not consider in the future. But right now, that is not what we are doing across CAF or our other lenders. David Whiston : Okay. And do you think inevitably you have going to have to over 72 months? Jon Daniels : We have chosen not to. Again, we are trying to make the right decision for the customer. We are not necessarily convinced that 84 months is best on a used car, so we will see what the market dictates. And we obviously know that prices are increasing and terms are increasing, but we also expect prices to probably normalize as well, and it might not be necessary. But again, we want to make the best decision for the customer, and we feel like we are still able to sell vehicles without providing that today. David Whiston : Alright. Thank you, guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Next, we will go to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon, your line is open. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. I just had a quick follow-up. I know that you have planned more investments in marketing, but CAF really floated up in the fourth quarter. I think it ended up at around $350 million for the full year. Is $350 million like a right run rate? And I am wondering how you think about the guardrails around marketing in an environment where the consumer just may be incredibly distracted? Bill Nash : Yes. No, great question, Sharon. And look, I think back on kind of pre-pandemic, if I look at our overall advertising spend, we are spending \u2013 as we said we would, we said we are going to spend more. We are spending about 70% more than pre-pandemic, which if you look at it on a unit basis, it\u2019s probably about a 55% or so increase on a per unit basis. I think we kind of came right in the range of where we talked about being this year when we started out this year, in that mid-$300 per unit. And I would tell you, I think we are at a point where there are certain things we want to make sure that we advertise and get out there, especially as we have new functionality. And I can\u2019t see us necessarily taking a step back on our advertising. Now, to your question, do you continue to step up, that\u2019s where we will figure out what\u2019s going on in the dynamics, where is the consumer right now, to figure out if we go beyond that. But I think a good way to think about it, is the spend on a per unit basis this year will be similar to what it was for last year. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks so much for taking the follow-up. I just want to follow-up on the instant offer with consumers. Right now, consumers having positive equity in their cars, I would think that would make it easier to buy from them just because they are making money on each one. But as we return to negative equity in vehicles over the coming years, do you think that will make it harder for you guys to customer source, or how do you anticipate that impacting your ability to source and kind of have success with instant offer as we return to negative equity? Can you just roll that into financing or how do you handle that? Bill Nash : Yes. So Daniel, I mean surprisingly, there are still folks that have negative equity out there today, albeit it\u2019s down just because the prices are up hot. But that\u2019s an environment that we have lived in for the last almost 30 years. We have consumers coming in with negative equity. Now you have got, obviously, is this price appreciation, is there a risk down the road that some customers, it may be harder for them because they can\u2019t come up with a big enough down payment or whatever. But again, the way I think about it is \u2013 and Jon talked a little bit about this. If you look at loan-to-value, loan-to-values have actually gone down. People are putting more down payments down, so I think that\u2019s a good sign. I think the other thing is all these customers are buying today, it\u2019s not like they are going to all decide to trade in a year from now or 2 years from now or 3 years from now. They are going to be sprinkled throughout time, and we will manage the business just like we have in the past with other customers that have negative equity. So, we feel like we will be able to manage it both from a sales standpoint, but also to your point, on the buy standpoint as well. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we don\u2019t have any further questions. At this time, I will hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jess. Well, listen, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today and your questions and your support. I look back, FY \u201822 was a great year. It is great sales. It\u2019s great earnings, it\u2019s great market share. We have been making investments and those investments are paying off, and we are really excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we continue to be that positive and disruptive force within the used car industry. And again, I want to thank all of our associates because they are the reason for our success. Appreciate everything that they do on a daily basis, and we will talk again next quarter. Thank you again for your time. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 CarMax earnings release conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. For the first quarter of FY'23, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $9.3 billion, up 21% compared with last year's first quarter, driven by growth in average selling prices and wholesale volume gains, partially offset by a decline in retail used units sold. Across our retail, wholesale channels, we sold approximately 427,000 cars in total during the first quarter, down 5.5% versus last year's period. In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter declined 11% and used unit comps were down 12.7% versus the first quarter last year. Our performance was driven by the same macro factors that led to a market-wide decline in used auto sales during the quarter, including lapping material stimulus benefits paid in the prior year, widespread inflationary pressures including challenges to vehicle affordability and lower consumer confidence. We began the first quarter with a double-digit decline in comp sales during March, continuing the fourth quarter performance we discussed on our last earnings call. Comps then improved sequentially with May ending in a low single-digit decline. While we don't intend to talk about it each quarter, market share data provides additional context to our performance and indicates that our relative performance remained strong. Based on external data, we gained share each month from January through April, the latest periods for which title data is available. We believe the share gain reflects the strength of our business model and omnichannel platform, which gives us the ability to successfully manage through cycles like this one. In short, we remain focused on delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry and we believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable market share gains in any environment. We reported first quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $2,339, up $134 per unit versus the prior year period. We continue to focus on striking the right balance between covering cost increases, maintaining margin and passing along efficiencies to consumers to support vehicle affordability. Wholesale units were up 2.7% versus the first quarter last year, despite a calendar shift, which negatively impacted auction volume compared with the prior year. Wholesale volume was also pressured by our decision to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. We estimate that without these two factors, our wholesale unit growth would have been above 10%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,029 in line with $1,025 a year ago. We are pleased that we continue to drive wholesale unit growth, even as we lapped last year's nationwide launch of our instant online appraisal offering on carmax.com and in the face of the industry-wide decline in used sales. We believe our wholesale business provides an incremental growth lever and is a valuable component of our diversified business model. We bought approximately 362,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the first quarter, up 6% versus last year's period. We continue to be the nation's largest buyer of vehicles from consumers purchasing approximately 345,000 cars in the quarter, up 3% versus last year's record results. This enabled our self-sufficiency to remain above 70% during the quarter. We also sourced approximately 17,000 vehicles through our Max offer, our digital appraisal product for dealers that we mentioned during our last call. This is up 183% versus last year's period. As a reminder, buying directly from consumers and dealers lowers our acquisition cost, enhances our inventory selection and provides profitable incremental wholesale volume. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $204 million, down from $242 million during the same period last year as the provision for loan losses normalized versus last year's favorable adjustment. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF's contribution in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $1.56, down from $2.63 a year ago. While the decline in used sales was the key contributor, the comparison was also impacted by the following two items. First, as Jon will discuss, an $82 million year-over-year swing in the provision for loan losses, reflecting a more normalized environment. Second, earnings in last year's first quarter reflected a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. Total gross profit was $875 million, down 5% from last year's first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the 11% drop in total used unit sales, which was partially offset by the increase in retail gross profit per unit and the continued growth in wholesale units. Wholesale vehicle margin was $192 million, up 3% despite the headwinds in the quarter that Bill noted. Other gross profit was $120 million, down 15% from last year's first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effects of lower retail unit sales on service and EPP profits. Service results declined $31 million as lower sales and secondarily impacts from inflationary pressures drove a deleverage in results. EPP gross profit decreased by $18 million or 13%, slightly more than the retail unit sales rate decline. While penetration was stable at approximately 61%, this year's first quarter also reflected a $2.3 million unfavorable shift in the return reserve adjustments versus last year's period. Partially offsetting this decline in other gross profit was favorability in third-party finance income, which improved by $8 million, with income of $3.4 million compared to a cost of $4.6 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year's first quarter. First quarter also benefited from $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $657 million, up 19% from the prior year's quarter due to an increase in staffing costs and marketing, the continued investment in our strategic initiatives, growth costs related to the increase in appraisal buys and used stores and the consolidation of Edmunds. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 75% from 59.9% during the first quarter last year. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to three factors. First, a $61 million increase in compensation and benefits, excluding share-based compensation, driven by the annualization of the strong growth in staffing we experienced in the back half of last year, the inclusion of Edmunds payroll this quarter versus a year ago, wage pressures and the ramp in field staffing in anticipation of a stronger tax season. Partially offsetting this increase was a $16 million decrease in share-based compensation. Second, a $26 million increase in other overheads. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives, as well as growth-related costs. Third, a $16 million increase in advertising expense. This increase was primarily due to last year's lower level of spend in the first quarter given our tight inventory position and robust customer demand. In addition, this quarter spend had anticipated a stronger tax season. We've navigated many challenging consumer cycles throughout our history and remain committed to operating efficiently and effectively in every macro environment. We have already begun to better align staffing in our stores and CDCs to consumer demand as part of our ability to quickly adapt our business. From a capital structure perspective, we remain in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. We also generated sufficient cash to both pay down our revolver by more than $580 million and increase the pace of our share repurchase program relative to the back half of fiscal year '22. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $158 million. First quarter also marked our entry into the New York City metro market. We opened a store in Edison, New Jersey and in the second quarter, we expect to open stores in Wayne, New Jersey at East Meadow, New York. We anticipate adding two more stores in this market next year. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. Our CarMax Auto Finance business delivered solid results again this quarter despite the volatile broader lending environment. During the first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was over $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, which was in line with year ago, but has significantly increased from 8.2% in the previous quarter. The majority of this quarter-over-quarter change came from increased rates charged to consumers rather than from the mix of credit. As the Fed clearly signaled interest rate hikes beginning of the calendar year, CAF was able to quickly test and methodically adjust consumer rates to carefully manage sales, finance margin and penetration. As a result of these proactive rate changes, CAF's penetration in the first quarter, net of 3-day payoffs was 39.3% compared with 43.7% last year. Of importance, CAF saw it\u2019s penetration level improved during the quarter as we observed banks and credit unions raising their own consumer rates during this period. Our Tier 2 partners continue to compete for the attractive CarMax business resulting in a penetration rate of 25.2% compared with 22.8% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 7.1% of used unit sales compared with 10% year ago. And we believe this is an indication that these customers have been impacted the most by challenges to vehicle affordability. CAF income for the quarter was $204 million, a decrease of 15% or $37 million from the same period last year. I want to take a moment to clarify the year over year swing in our loan loss provision. You will recall that last year CAF recognized $24 million of income in Q1 related to the loan loss provision, as we continue to adjust our reserve based on favorable loss performance versus expectations set at the start of the COVID pandemic. CAF's loan loss provision this quarter was $58 million, reflecting a more normalized dollar amount, given the loss performance observed within the quarter. Significantly offsetting the provision headwind was our total interest margin, which grew $53 million year-over-year, including a $36 million increase and interest in fee income and a $17 million reduction in interest expense. The lower interest expense was supported by a $9 million benefit from our hedging strategy. The current quarter's provision of $58 million resulted in an ending reserve balance of $458 million or 2.85% of managed receivables. This is a slight increase from the 2.77% at the end of the fourth quarter and included a 5 basis point adjustment for the growth in Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume originated by CAF. We remain confident in both the resiliency of the CAF consumer and our ability to serve them well. While delinquency rates have increased, our Tier 1 credit losses remain comfortably within our historical operating range of 2% to 2.5%. At this point, I would like to also provide an update on our industry-leading online finance experience. As a reminder, our unique finance based shopping engine or FBS allows for multiple lenders to decision a single customer or co-applicants on our entire retail inventory, providing a full suite of personalized decisions available at the consumers' fingertips within carmax.com. During the month of March, we further enhanced this experience by testing a no impact your credit score pre-qualification feature along with a streamlined application process that provides real-time credit decisions on our full inventory. We are extremely excited about the results thus far. It is currently available to approximately 25% of our online customers and we anticipate scaling nationwide during the rest of the year. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great, thank you, Jon, and thank you, Enrique. For the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building a leading e-commerce platform that integrates buying and selling cars with our best-in-class store experience. I'm pleased to share that during the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone, as we have now enabled online self-progression capabilities for all of our retail customers. Our journey to this point required a massive organizational transformation and I want to thank all of our associates for their tremendous support throughout as we work together to create our omnichannel experience for our customers. In regard to our first quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from 8% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 54% of retail unit sales were Omni sales this quarter, down slightly from 56% in the prior year's quarter. Online omni and in-person sales can vary from quarter to quarter depending on consumer preferences and how they choose to interact with us. While we expect our online and omni sales to grow over time, our goal is to provide the best experience whether that's in-store, online or a seamless combination of the two. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%. This is up from 24% in last year's first quarter. Our e-commerce engine combined with our unparalleled nationwide physical footprint is a competitive advantage. Our ability to deliver integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market relative to others in our industry and is a key differentiator. We're now going to turn our efforts to further improving the experience for our customers and our associates by focusing on the seamlessness of our online and in-store offerings. Some of our key areas of focus include, first, as Jon just mentioned, we're deploying a more sophisticated version of our finance day shopping product. As interest rates rise, consumers' ability to confidently secure financing is more important than ever. The expansion of our best-in-class pre-qualification product once fully deployed will provide frictionless and seamless access to multi-lender credit terms on every car within our retail inventory on every cart within our retail inventory whether the consumer chooses to browse and purchase from the comfort of their home, walk the lot on their own with their mobile device or shop alongside one of our exceptional sales consultants. Second area of focus is continuing to leverage data science, automation and AI to improve efficiency and effectiveness across our buying organizations, business offices and customer experience centers. Finally, we will continue to use Max offer to acquire vehicles and build on our market leading position as a buyer of cars. With Max offer, we can utilize the Edmunds sales team to open new markets and sign up new dealers for the service. It's another example of our ongoing focus on innovating and finding new opportunities in the white space adjacent to our existing capabilities. We are currently live in over 30 markets and anticipate launching additional markets throughout FY'23. Staying on Edmunds for a moment, I want to acknowledge that as of June 1, we reached the one-year anniversary of this acquisition. We are glad to have all of the talented Edmunds associates on our team and have been very pleased with the value that's been created so far. We are equally excited about our path forward as we continue to build out together our vehicle and customer acquisition programs. Before closing, I want to acknowledge, there is uncertainty in the market and in regard to consumer behavior, we believe that our fundamentals are strong and that our diversified business model enables us to gain profitable market share in any environment. Multiple opportunities exist to grow the business as we roll forward and we're excited about the future. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Orlando? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] All right, and we will take our first question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Can you hear me? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel : I'm sorry about that. I think transmission problem. Congrats on the continued progress. So the question I want to ask in this from a bigger picture perspective as we look at the sales trends here, Bill, in your prepared comments you mentioned again some of the same factors, obviously the difficult comparisons last year again stimulus and then elevated prices confidence and such. But as we're progressing now into '22, are you seeing more clearly kind of how the consumer really is -- how the consumer is behaving, the underlying health of the consumer, and what's really driving the business at this point, particularly as you mentioned the, I guess, a strengthening trend through fiscal Q1 is the health of the consumer getting better, is that more of a function of comparisons? Bill Nash : Yes, Brian, look, I think overall the consumer is absolutely a little softer, just because of all the things I've talked about it. I think it's hard to quantify if you think about lapping over stimulus, vehicle affordability, the general inflationary pressures, rising interest rates. If you think about those, it's hard to quantify the impact of each one. Now, I would tell you the further we've gotten from lapping the stimulus, obviously, the better we performed as I noted in my opening remarks, we got sequentially better on comps throughout the quarter, which is encouraging. But that being said, I think the consumer is softer, but there is still some demand out there and I think that's what we're trying to really maximize on and we're taking several steps to take advantage of that. It's one of the reasons why we're -- we continue to take efficiencies and pass what we can along to consumers to make the vehicle a bit more affordable. In my opening remarks, I talked about selling a little bit more of older vehicles, making the vehicles a little bit more affordable because we know some of the consumers are looking for that. In fact, Brian, you followed us long enough to know that we used to have what we called a ValueMax, which was really 6 years old vehicle, older than 6 or more than 60,000 miles, typically that -- what that type of inventory runs, let's call it, and I gave in year 22% to 25% of our sales. Well, for this quarter, it was more like 35% of our sales. So there is some demand for that. And I think the other thing I would point out is it's the reason why we also have the lending platform that we do that we have great third-party lenders and CAF just to make sure that we can get the most competitive interest rate for our customers.. So I think those are the things that we're doing to kind of work through this. And while the consumer is softer, there is still some demand out there. Brian Nagel : No, that's very helpful. But if I could just slip one follow up into that. So, are you seeing, as you look at maybe across the different cohorts of your business, higher-priced vehicles, lower-priced vehicles, are you seeing now more significant demand dynamic across those cohorts? Bill Nash : On the vehicle prices? Brian Nagel : Yes, just to get an idea of that -- okay. Bill Nash : What's interesting about it, Brian, is if you look back a year ago, 70% of our inventory was under $25,000. Fast forward to today, it's more like 43% to 45% and that's really a result of inflationary pressures, which again is one of the reasons why we're focused on getting more affordable inventory out there. So that's what our big push is right now. Now realizing some folks are interested in a higher model car and or an older car, but again, that's what our focus is right now. Brian Nagel : Got it. I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : Next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thank you. Why don't we try to follow up on that first question maybe in a little bit different way. When I think about, Bill what you kind of talked about what's going on in the business, you re-merchandised, you've got investments into the sales and labor force, obviously, those mature at different rates. But if you look at kind of going from low double-digit declines in, say, March or April to low single-digit declines now in comps. What would you attribute the improvement to? Is it conversion? Is it the people in the stores? Is it that consumer might have paused and now they're realizing they have to make a transaction? Would just love to kind of hear how you and the team are attributing the sequential improvement and maybe to what initiatives are they more consumer-related? Bill Nash : Yes, it's a good question, John. I mean obviously, I'd love to tell you that it's because of our continued focus on improving the experience, getting the right inventory and they're improving prices and all that, while I do think that's a factor. I don't think you can ignore the fact that a year ago in March, the biggest stimulus checks hit the ground. And when you think about it, tax season this year versus last year would have looked very similar. The only difference though is last year $1,400 check went out to consumers during tax season and that did not happen this year. So, that absolutely had an impact. So I'm not going to sit here and say it's all us that's driving, I think there are some macro factors that are allowing it to improve the further you get away from that stimulus. Enrique Mayor-Mora: I think as well, like, our success in buying cars directly from consumers as reflected in our self-sufficiency rate really allows us to buy those older cars. And as Bill talked about, our percent of sales coming from older cars were not because the consumer demand is there. Those cars are not easy to buy in auction. So it's really a nod to our ability to buy cars directly from consumers. John Healy : Great. And then just one follow-up question. I think you mentioned the auction calendar working against the wholesale business this quarter. Will that revert? Will we pick that up in Q2? I was just curious how the timing impact might or that there might be a benefit quarter here as we look out for the remainder of the year. Bill Nash : Yes. No, great question. First of all, we're very pleased with the auction performance, wholesale performance, in general. We're pleased with the fact that we actually grew it. The dynamic was that we had one less Monday sale and swapped it for Tuesday and Monday is a bigger auction volume day than a Tuesday and that actually we got the benefit of that at some point last year. So that will not be a pickup. The other thing that I cited though was that we have made the decision to pull some what we normally run through the auctions and build those cars to retail and absent those two things. If you pull them out, the wholesale would have grown by more than 10% which, again, we're excited about. John Healy : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : Up next, we'll hear from Ms. Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. So as you think about offering some more value-oriented cars, have you also considered kind of swaying from the, I guess, I would say fully reconditioned status that you've historically had and maybe leading from the scratches or whatever and marking it as is to further enhance the value proposition, I know that's been something you've been leery of in the past from a brand perspective. And then secondarily, obviously, there is a lot of concern that things are going to get worse before they get better, I mean how are you positioning from a controllable standpoint in the event that there is another leg down. I mean how should we think about SG&A, and what you can cut if you need to cut it? Bill Nash : Yes, I'll tackle both because I'm sure Enrique will have some comments on the kind of the concerns going forward. From your first question, as far as the older inventory. Sharon, if we're going to make it a CarMax car, it's going to be a CarMax car. And you know, you take these older cars, not all of them can make the cut. And we\u2019ll end up trying to run through some through retail, they won't make it, but we're bringing them up to the CarMax standards. So I think that answers your first question. The other thing I would just point out there is those cars, and we've talked about this, but we haven't talked about it for a while, those cars are generally more profitable. So, they also provide us a tailwind when you think about margin management, pricing inventory that kind of thing. So we'll continue to do that, we'll continue to bring up to CarMax standards and not go with a lower standard. As far as the concerns about what may manifest in the future with the consumer, where the consumer is going, Sharon, we've been through this several times in the past and whether it's \u201908, \u201809 recession, whether it's the depths of COVID, we've been able to navigate it profitably both times and we have lots of levers, we've shown that we've been able to pull those levers whether they're expense levers and you think about, you can slow down some of your growth, you can slow down some of your initiatives, you can pull back on advertising, your variable will adjust or if it's just you know if you want to secure cash, you can modify your stock buyback, you can start on some of your capital expenditures or delayed. So these are just some of the levers that you know that we pulled in the past and we're going to continue to monitor the conditions. But I'd tell you that it here today, yes, the consumer soft, but now is not the time. I don't think to be pulling back on our initiatives because the initiatives what are going to really help us grow in the future. But that being said, we're certainly aware of the outside factors and we'll continue to monitor. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, I would just add to that by saying, we're going to be -- our objective really is to ensure that our expenses are in line with customer demand while at the same time making sure that we're investing in the key areas of that are going to enable us to grow profitability and market share over time. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with a view of that, we've already begun to kind of align our cost structure to current demand through scheduling, through natural attrition. So we've already done those and look if a recession comes, we're confident in our ability to weather it as we're coming at it from a position of strength. We're profitable. We have a strong balance sheet and we generate cash. So we feel, again, as Bill mentioned, we've been through these cycles before and we feel confident we can manage through it effectively while growing our market share as well. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Nice execution on the retail gross profit per unit. Can you help us unpack that a little bit versus the prior quarter, what drove the sequential uptick there? Is it reconditioning saving? Is it just the sourcing mix? Is it pricing related? Curious if you could bucket those if possible and I have a follow-up. Bill Nash : Yes, thanks for the question, Rajat. Yes, the way I think about it and I talked about this in the opening remarks, we're really trying to walk upon balance here. We have some efficiencies, historically we've always passed our efficiencies along and the big efficiencies that we're working with right now are the fact that we've got self-sufficiency still at a high, but we also have this new dynamic where we're signed to more older cars. And as I talked about earlier, these older cars generally carry more margin. So that's also an opportunity to manage our margin and pass along efficiencies to the consumers. And this quarter, obviously, it's a little higher than last year and even our five-year average. And that's because with these efficiencies, we continue to pass along the price savings, but we also took a little bit more to the bottom line and we monitor sales elasticity, competitors' inventory levels that kind of things. And we'll continue to do that going forward, but we feel really good about our margin position right now and bearing the other big changes and keep an eye on the testing, we feel good about the margins going forward as well. Rajat Gupta : Got it, got it. Relatedly, on the topic you're shifting to SG&A, I mean is there any of the slight change in the sourcing mix or trying to maintain that GPU coming in some way at the expense of more cost on the SG&A side. Now, you're not roughly $2,700 per unit and this is the seasonally strongest quarter typically every year, so curious like what takes us down further as the year progresses? What are the areas of opportunity? If you could just give us some puts and takes on that front on how the SG&A per unit should progress going forward? Bill Nash : Yes, I'll pass to Enrique in just a second, but just to be clear, like these, the margin improvements are not coming at the expense of SG&A and the way we think about margin when we were building the cars we've absolutely seen inflationary pressures in the build of cars, which goes to the COGS. But we're also working very hard to offset those. So not only we are passing along some savings to the consumer through some of these efficiencies, but I also feel like because we're offsetting these costs that's also passing along to consumers, because some competitors won't have levers and if the costs go up, which everyone seeing whether it's gas, it's parts, it's labor, if they don't have levers to pull, their prices are going up. So I think about that is also an efficiency on price as well. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. And I would say just to build on that. There is some pressure on SG&A from the amount of buys, right. So we've had tremendous success around the amount of buys there, we have to staff up to make sure we can accommodate that and ebbs and flows through to our self efficiency rate. So there is some pressure on SG&A, but what I'd tell you the story in Q1, an important story on the deleverage is really driven by a couple of things, right, year-over-year, when you look at the deleverage. Number one is like were are understaffed last year in the first quarter, you recall going back to the pandemic, coming out of the pandemic, we were understaffed. And we spent the back half of last year understaffed -- or staffing up. As the last year was understaffed, we also spent less on a per unit in marketing last year in the first quarter, because our inventory was fairly limited. So we spent a little bit less than we had very strong demand, so we're comping over those 2 things in the first quarter, which put a fair bit of pressure on that leverage rate. I think the second thing, as well as in anticipation of a stronger tax season performance, we have staffed up in our stores and in our CDCs and we had to spend more in marketing, now those sales didn't come, but as I've talked about, we're fairly nimble and we can manage those back down, which is what we've already begun to do when it comes to staffing in the CDCs and in our stores. And again we're doing that through just attrition and through better scheduling. But we can manage that down, but I think it's important to understand the Q1 deleverage what drove it. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Great, thanks for the color. I'll jump back in queue. Bill Nash : Thank you, Rajat. Operator : Alright, up next, we'll hear from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking for our question. I wanted to ask on the competitive environment for CAF right now. I think last quarter we talked about how some of the other lenders were extending terms to 84 months. They weren't passing through higher cost of funds. It feels like you mentioned in your prepared remarks, if they were starting to pass through some of those higher cost of funds during the quarter. But just curious how the competitive backdrop is changing and obviously CAF penetration went down in the quarter. I mean, was that intentional on your part walking away from business? Or can you tell us what drove that? Thanks. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, I appreciate the question, Daniel. Yes, thanks for the recognition in the prepared remarks, we did state. I think the story or the headline for penetration this quarter was really about cash pricing moves. We're not walking away from business at all. If you look at the average APR, we charge for our customers last quarter, it was 8.2% this quarter, it\u2019s 9% largely coming from us passing along our increased costs under the consumer, it's always a delicate balance, you're trying to figure out managing, making sure you're highly competitive to your customer. Remember we're competing directly with predominantly credit unions and to some degree external banks. We install that -- what we observe, we just want a little sooner than they did are kind of trough of penetration in the quarter was more in that February-March timeframe and we watched our competition, we have sort of them raise rates throughout the quarter, we were just a little sooner and therefore our penetration came back the cadence within the quarter. So I think it will continue to be that way again trying to manage our penetration, our net interest margin capture and obviously making sure extremely competitive for our customers. So it's a delicate balance it will continue one, but we'll continue to watch what our competitors do and what the Fed does. Bill Nash : And Jon -- well our penetration went down those consumers that brought their own financing went up. Jon Daniels : Great. That's generally the offset. So in our space usually a customer sees the car, they want it, making either choose the financing from CAF, or again that's what's great about our program is they can go externally not feel like they have to walk away from the car, and that's generally what they do. So they just chose to do that this quarter. Daniel Imbro : Got it. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks so much guys. Bill Nash : Thanks, Daniel. Operator : All right. Up next, we'll take a question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Nathan Friedman : Yes, hi, this is Nathan Friedman on for Seth. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I wanted to ask was regarding retail gross profit per unit, are you expecting this level of GPU going forward given the current used car pricing environment and a return to normalized or possibly accelerated depreciation through the duration of the year? And how should we be thinking about that? Bill Nash : Yes, Nathan. As I said earlier, we feel good about our margins. We've got some tailwinds there. I would tell you, we've navigated through times of depreciation before and I think we excel at it. And in those times of depreciation before, we've been able to maintain our margins. So I would expect that to be similar. I think the only times where our margins have come under pressure a little bit is when you see rapid, rapid depreciation of a very short period of time. But even then it's short-lived. So we feel very comfortable about our ability to continue to maintain margins. But again, we're going to also like I said earlier, we'll be testing a lot of different things and making sure that we have an outward eye on where the consumer is and sales elasticity competitors and all that. Nathan Friedman : Got it. Thanks for that. And my second question is focused on your strong net interest margin performance this quarter and the sequential increase here, despite your last ABS securitizations margins experiencing pretty large sequential margin declines. Can you provide more detail or quantify how much benefit you experienced from your hedging strategy this quarter? And how you're envisioning net interest margins going forward? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, we -- Enrique and I\u2019ll probably tag team on that, first just to talk about the net interest margin growth that we saw during the quarter. Again the key to remember is our business model in our accounting processes we earn over time rather than a gain on sale model, so the assets that are providing our net interest margin in this quarter coming from a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, where spreads are incredibly healthy. So obviously what we bring on this quarter, and most recent ABS transaction, it's really going to offset what we're rolling off of the portfolio. So it just so happens that timing is such that such strong margin assets still remain in our portfolio and will for some time. And eventually if we can keep our margin high, we'll continue to keep manage that well, then the fall off, will be -- may be minimized or at least slow on the downturn. With regard to hedging strategy, I'll let but Enrique talk to that. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. And as Jon mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had and we experienced in the quarter a $9 million gain from a hedge benefit just to maybe explain that a little bit more. The vast majority of our receivables are funded through the securitization market and we have an accounting hedge on all of those. But we also have alternative funding vehicles as we've been talking about for a few years, right? With our banking partners a portion of those receivables have a cash flow hedge, but not an accounting hedge. And that's really due to our desire to maintain flexibility in the funding profile. So those receivables, they don't have an accounting hedge, get mark-to-market every quarter. So, we benefited this quarter given the recent sharp and material change in interest rates, but moving forward we\u2019d only expect us to be material to any degree in periods again with our sharp and material changes in the interest rate. Nathan Friedman : Well. That\u2019s good. Thank you for the time and best of luck. Jon Daniels : Thank you. Operator : All right. And up next, we will take a question from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to go back to the shift towards older vehicles. And Bill, I mean as we look at the next few years, the zero to six year old car population is likely to shrink pretty dramatically or not really recover much if that is what we're seeing on new vehicle sales side, I mean, the vehicles just don't exist in reality. So as you look at going older to beyond six years, it just seems like there's a real opportunity in the seven to 10 year old vehicles. Our high-quality products is very different than they were 10 to 20-years ago, so you can wrap them pretty well to the consumers, so they're good products for you to rep in sell. So just curious, as we think about this idea there and like you said you went from 25% Valuemax or Valuemax like vehicles to 35% this quarter. Could that be significantly higher over time? And just the kind of thing that could be not just sort of a move to offset some of the shortage of supply on zero to six year side, but somehting you\u2019d be more structural and if you think five to 10 years down the line could dramatically increase your addressable market for each store or in total? Bill Nash : Yes. Good morning, John. Yes, it's a great question. The beauty of our business is whatever the consumers are looking for, we'll put out there. Now obviously, it\u2019s a little harder to find some of these vehicles and build them. We've been through a similar situation. If you go back to \u201908 and \u201909 the recession when the new car SAAR dropped dramatically. It was actually more pronounced back then, I think what that did to like a 10-year supply of newer type cars, because you know the SAAR was down to really low double-digits. I think at one point, if not even below that. So there was this bubble that had to work itself through. And I would expect to see a similar level, but not nearly to the magnitude that we saw back in \u201808 or \u201909. I would tell you, the great thing that's different then -- back then, we are able to navigate them, but the great thing that we have now that we didn't is just our self-sufficiency and when I think about that type of inventory our best source of that is from consumers and so the fact that our self-sufficiency is so high. It just gives us a lot of that inventory, you know, I talked a little bit about those over six, but it really doesn't matter if you break it down zero to four, you know, that's generally like a year ago at 66% of our sales or so this quarter is about 50% five to seven year old vehicles again it's 20% to 25%, now it's 30% to 35%, 8%-plus, it\u2019s like 15%, it across the board. And we have a better source of inventory now, so we're excited about the opportunity going forward. John Murphy : Okay. And then maybe just to follow-up on that, on the -- I mean, it\u2019s seems like on the acquisition side, it\u2019s -- you\u2019re doing a good job on self-sufficiency side. But if we think about that consumer buying that vehicle. It sounds like, they actually have a higher propensity than the younger vehicles to actually purchase online. I mean, when you are looking at your omnichannel efforts and actually conversion based on the age groups. I mean, is that true that basically this seve plus year old vehicle is actually -- that buyer is actually more apt to buy online then sort of the one to three year old bucket. I mean, I'm just curious what you're seeing there? Bill Nash : Yes, John. To be honest, off the top my head, I don't know if that's necessarily true, I mean what we're seeing from an online sales perspective is it's a wide swath of consumers looking for different merchandise. So I don't think that's necessarily true that it's the older stuff that selling online. There is some of it, I don't think it's disproportionate. John Murphy : Okay. All right, thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you, John. Operator : All right. Up next, we'll hear from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Great, thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Just wanted to ask first if I could, if you all could share some incremental color around the buying trends you're seeing. I don't know if you can segment it out by income cohort, kind of, 40k and below versus 100k plus households. But, but just talk about maybe what you saw there in the quarter? And then how that has evolved, if the sales have, kind of, stabilized it down low single-digit? Bill Nash : Mike, I don't have the cohort that you're looking for as far as household income the both our online, in-store appraisal lane has really resonated broadly with all consumers. I would say, interestingly, for the quarter we bought it may not be a total surprise we bought more what I would call larger SUV pickup trucks from consumers that may be because of gas prices, but on the flip side, we also sold more of that there were consumers, you know, I think if you pay the right and you have a price right that they\u2019ll sell and we actually -- we saw that. But I don't have the data in front of me to tell you. Okay, household income, what does that look like on a sale. But I will tell you, it's the product that we have out there has really appealed across the spectrum. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I guess what I would add to that just some of the credit perspective trying to align maybe household income with the credit quality of the customer coming through the door. I think we mentioned before, I think there is demand out there. You see the lower credit quality customer who is still shopping still applying for credit, they just seem to be maybe priced out of the markets at times, because of the price of the vehicle and ultimately the monthly payments. So I think the demand is there, I think as inventory comes down they're going to be able to get there. So again provided there is some correlation between that consumer and the lower income consumer. I think the demand is there. Michael Montani : And if I could just follow-up on the profit front, earlier this year you all had mentioned the gross profit dollars, we need to grow, kind of, high single-digits to leverage, given some of the investments underway. So just wanted to think about that into the back half of the year. Does add expense kind of step up here given the multi-channel has been initially rolled out, head count it sounds like it could moderate a bit? So, just help us to understand kind of how to think about the pace of SG&A dollars for the back half? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. And so what we have said last call, as we expect in fiscal year \u201923 actually we're going to need an excess of that historical range of high single-digit, right. So we need more than that to leverage this coming year, because what I talked about earlier, largely that annualization of the success in staffing and again Q1 really is the quarter where we see most of that impact. We are committed to ensuring that our expenses are in line with customer demand. And again, I talked about that we've already -- the steps we've already undertaken. So for Q1 really from a year-over-year leverage perspective, it is our toughest quarter. Michael Montani : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : All right. Up next, we will take a question from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question as well. I wanted to dig into your sourcing mode and really understand your Maxoffer tool a little bit better. Can you give us a feel for the economics of that tool? And why do dealers choose to use it given you're also competitors in that local market? And then, are those cars as profitable as cars you sourced directly from the consumer or from auctions? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, Craig. Yes, we're -- like I said earlier, we're excited about Maxoffer, it\u2019s been a product that we've been working on, it took a little bit of a back seat to the IO, but we're leveraging similar algorithms. When I think about the profitability, obviously, the -- well first of all the Maxoffer buys are absolutely more profitable than buying offsite. As I rank on that, I think the most profitable or certainly the IOs that are consumers to bring us the cars for obvious reasons we're not saying logistics that kind of thing. But for the Maxoffer they're not as profitable as a consumer, but there's still more profitable than buying offsite, which again makes sense, because we're not having to pay buy fess. As far as why dealers, we choose to use it, but there is lots of deals out there have inventory that they're not interested in, or they have appraisals that they're looking at that they really don't know how to value it. And so this is a service that can be provided at no cost with a backing on it and it's proven to resonate. Like I said in the call, we're little over 30 -- in 30 markets, we have plenty of opportunity -- continue to expand it. Edmunds has 1,000s of dealers that they work with our auctions. We have 1,000s of dealers, so we think there's a lot of potential here. Craig Kennison : Can you shed any light on the fee structure? Are you getting a fee or they getting a fee? Enrique Mayor-Mora: So we do -- they actually we make it a little bit what we make it worth our time, so they actually do make some money on these, and that's kind of how we work it. Craig Kennison : Perfect, thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : All right. Our next question will come from Evan Silverberg with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Silverberg : Good morning all. Evan Silverberg on for Adam Jonas. Recognizing there were some color in the prepared remarks on comps per month year-over-year. Curious if you could give any additional color on an absolute basis? How sales trended throughout the quarter? And what you're thinking in terms of exit rate into 2Q? Bill Nash : Yes. And like I said in my opening remarks, they got better progressively throughout the quarter from double-digits to low single-digit negative comp for the end of the quarter. So we've been pleased with that, that trend. And obviously we'll talk about June in second quarter at that time, but again we've -- we feel pleased as we exited the quarter. Evan Silverberg : And even within the quarter are you seeing any trends within the tiers of the consumer or you think it's pretty steady throughout the different classes? Bill Nash : No. I think it's pretty steady through the different ones, as Jon pointed out earlier, I think that, that lower FICO customer is probably being impacted the most by vehicle affordability. But again that, that's the way it started out at the beginning of the quarter and that's the way it ended the quarter. So I think it's fairly consistent throughout the quarter. Evan Silverberg : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : All right. Our next question will come from David Whiston with Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks, good morning. It's great to see free cash flow generation along with buybacks in the debt pay down. I was just curious on the roughly now I think about $1 billion then due two years from now. Is your goal to just get rid of that revolver through internal free cash flow generation before that time? Are you willing to do an five year, 10-year bond offering at some point? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Well we would. As you said, I mean, we are very pleased with our cash flow performance in the quarter. You know, despite a challenging sales quarter certainly where our business model is able to generate cash and we're really pleased that allowed us to pay down a fair chunk on our revolver, almost $600 million and accelerate our share repurchase program. So in terms of what we're going to do moving forward, I think the way to think about it is, will be nimble to the environment, we\u2019re going to do what's right for our shareholders. And while taking a look at how we're performing and kind of what the options are for us. I think the way to think about it is we intend on managing within our capital structure at 30% to 45% adjusted debt-to-cap, and that's how we kind of manage the business we do that by taking on debt, we\u2019re pulling down debt and also by our share repurchase program. So those are the levers that we use. So moving forward, you know, we\u2019ll end up managing to that rate. David Whiston : Okay. And on the free cash flow generation, it looks like you've got a lot of help from inventory reductions, which you hadn't gotten that help in working capital in the past several quarters. Just curious, was your inventory decline here intentional to get some free cash flow generation? Or is it perhaps a function of buying more older vehicles? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, it was a little bit more seasonal, you have this time of year in the first quarter and leading into the first half of the year, we ramped down their inventory, as we work through tax season. It's a little bit of that. We also saw quarter-to-quarter just the average cost of our inventory went down a little bit too. So we did see that, and that helped us a little bit as well. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Operator : All right. And moving on, we'll hear from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a follow-up question on kind, of CAF funding cost. So sort of I guess a few things like the interest rate hedge question, are you seeing that interest rates stay at these levels at the $9 million hedging benefit would unwind and trying to understand, like how long you said just last for? And then separately for the warehouse facility, kind of, in the K, like what's the benchmark rate for the warehouse facility is that like LIBOR or whatevere replace LIBOR or SIP number that\u2019s called? And then, sorry, one last follow-on to this bigger picture, so I could tell you probably passed on that 50 bps of rate some of the customer. How much of that 300 basis point increase in benchmark rates do you ultimately think you\u2019ll pass-through? And that's it from me. Jon Daniels : I'll take the last one first, actually, yes, as you mentioned, we certainly have past along rates consumers. As I said previously, it's going to constantly be a test that assess right you recognize of what we're trying to manage penetration, margin, customer experience all of those things. So we're going to watch it very carefully. What I was very pleased with this quarter was and it wasn't just a single move and then forget it, and then absorbed it, it was identified pockets of populations that we think are less elastic more elastic test, adjust, you know, look at what our competition is doing, and that's generally how we operate. So again we are not looking to absolutely lead the market in past in that great along. We want to make sure we remain highly competitive. Again, fortunately, we have that three day payoff option. The customers may take advantage of to make sure we still sell the car. So I can't speculate exactly a much will pass along, but you understand how we're managing it. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, and for the other two questions. In terms of the cost basis in our warehouses, it really is LIBOR and more and more SOFR as that, that tool kind of matures somewhat. In terms of the hedging question, very specifically the $9 million, but we do not have an accounting hedge. We have a cash flow hedge. Again, that really is going to change it will be benefit like it was this quarter, it could be a detriment only when interest rates are going to shape -- change sharply and materially, that's when they're going to change, because we have that hedge. The hedges over the life of the loan that we have, right? But again, it's only really going to change from quarter-to-quarter. When there\u2019s a sharp and material change in those interest rates and that's why we see a benefit or [Technical Difficulty]. And again and that\u2019s on as I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of our receivables are due to securitization market will not be impacted on the quarter-to-quarter basis with that, it's really to -- very small and much smaller pool of receivables that we have to our banking partners to alternative funding we'll see that. But again, if we don't -- that those interest rates still change sharply or materially you're really not going to be anything impactful quarter-to-quarter. Chris Bottiglieri : That\u2019s okay. And then bigger picture question, the GPUs, I mean, this feels like a two to three standard deviation move in the GPU, like you usually are pretty methodical about kind of past the amount of the consumer taking market share. Just kind of your taking that GPU in kind of letting your ASP\u2019s in output. So I guess it cut us down like, when I could tell you're comfortable running at this higher GPU level like what's philosophically changing that's causing you to kind of shift towards GPU and maybe less than market share or help maybe I'm wrong here in understanding correctly, how would you frame it? Bill Nash : No, I think you're right, it is lumpy in any given quarter you can make $50 to $80 difference, this is always little bit more than and it was a conscious decision. But again, the way we approach is we really look for efficiencies first and foremost. And if we find the efficiencies then you have the decision to make. If you take a little bit more to margin you have to look at a lot of factors in order to determine that. And how much do you put towards the price and just based on all the factors that we took some of these efficiency. So it's really not on the backs of the consumer, what they're paying before, we're actually passing some of the efficiencies, some of these additional ones from the older vehicles and the sub-sufficiency we continue to pass them and then we took a little bit more this quarter. So it was a conscious decision as far as going forward, we'll continue to monitor things and what competitors are doing and the elasticity and make decisions as we always do during the quarter. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And we've been able to do that while growing our market share within the quarter, right. So [Multiple Speakers] in our market share. Bill Nash : Yes. Chris Bottiglieri : Thank you. Operator : All right. And we'll take a follow-up from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead. Chris Pierce : Hey, good morning. You guys have talked about better aligning expenses. We\u2019ve also talked about growing market share? And then just -- that last question, if GPU comfort you have at this higher level. Just curious how to think about advertising going forward. Can you kind of get a hobbled competitor out there? But I know the end market isn't really on fire either. So I'm kind of curious how you're thinking about advertising and advertising per vehicle going forward? Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you for the question, Chris. Look, I think our stance on advertising is still what we've been as we've said for this upcoming year. We expected to have a step up, I mean, keep in mind, if you go back pre-COVID, I think Enrique we're 70% up in -- Enrique Mayor-Mora: In total dollars and then on a per unit basis, most up 60%. Bill Nash : Yes. So when I think about advertising, we had a lot of good things to say. It's even though obviously consumer soft, there's a lot of advertising dollars being put in by everybody. And I think way that we will continue to go forward is with the guidance that we originally gave, which was really more in the ballpark of let's call it the $350 per unit, a little bit higher this quarter, but I think that's a good -- kind of a good thing to -- good way to think about it as we go forward. And then we've got lots of new capabilities, when you think about online self progression, we do anticipate at some point later in the year that we'll start to advertise that. And we do that, we'll shift some dollars around, we're always moving things between acquisition and awareness and whether it's appraisal awareness, whether it's consumer, retail, consumer awareness, we're always moving things around on any given quarter. So I would look for some new messaging later on this year. Chris Pierce : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : All right. Well, great. Well, thank you all for joining the call today and as always for your questions and your support. As always do, I want to thank our associates for everything they do and their commitment to making a positive impact on the customers and each others and our communities. And even particularly the environment, we just recently published our 2022 responsibility report, if you haven't had a chance look at it, I would highly encourage you to take a look at it. We're really proud of the values that we live every day and our ongoing commitment to all of our stakeholders to drive long-term sustainable value creation. So again, thank you for your time today and we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. We thank you again for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great, thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I get started, I want to share that my thoughts are with our associates, their families, and communities that are being impacted by Hurricane Ian. We have a significant number of stores in the storm's path. And as always, the safety of our associates is our top priority. We've taken steps to support our associates and our communities, and we will continue to monitor the situation and take actions to provide assistance as needed. Now to our results, this quarter reflects wide-spread pressure the used car industry is facing. Macro factors, including vehicle affordability that stems from persistent and broad inflation, climbing interest rates, and low consumer confidence, all led to a market-wide decline in used auto sales. In addition, wholesale values were affected by steep depreciation in the quarter. Despite the impact of these factors on our results, we continued to grow market share. We also continue to make progress on the key initiatives that will further strengthen our competitive differentiation over time. We have weathered a number of difficult cycles in our history. And, each time, we have successfully managed through them, and have leveraged key learnings to further strengthen our operating model. We remain on track to achieve our long-term strategy and goals. For the second quarter of FY'23, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.1 billion , up 2% compared with last year's second quarter, driven by growth in average selling prices, partially offset by lower retail and wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter declined 6.4%, and used unit comps were down 8.3% versus the second quarter last year. Our performance was impacted by the macro factors that I mentioned previously. We believe the industry sales were also impacted by shift in consumer spending prioritization from large purchases to smaller discretionary items. In response to the current environment and consumer demand, we have continued to offer a higher mix of lower-priced vehicles. We began the second quarter with a low single-digit decline in comp sales, during the June, that reflected the continuation of softer, although improving sales, which we discussed on our last earnings call. Comps then fell sharply at the beginning of July, with August ending in mid-teen decline. Last quarter, we reported market share data. We will do that again this quarter as the data provides additional context and highlights our performance relative to the industry. Based on external data, we continue to gain share through July, to latest period for which title data is available. We reported second quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $22.82, up $97 per unit versus the prior-year period, a reflection of our ability to manage used margin in any environment. We continue to focus on striking the right balance between covering cost increases, managing margin, and passing along efficiencies to consumers to support vehicle affordability. Wholesale unit sales were down 15.1% versus the second quarter last year, partially as a result of our deliberate decision to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. We estimate that without this shift, our wholesale units would have been down less than 10%. Performance was also impacted by depreciation of about $2,500 and as -- and as we intentionally [slowed-bys] [Ph] in reaction to rapidly-changing market conditions. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $881, down from $1,005 a year ago, and reflected softening market conditions as well as their decision to retail a higher mix of older used vehicles. Our ability to source these vehicles from consumers is a competitive advantage. But relative to younger vehicles, more of them fall out during the reconditioning process as they are not able to meet our standards for consumer sales. When that happens, we wholesale those vehicles, often at lower-than-normal margins. In the third quarter, we have been focused on aligning our offers to current conditions and adjusted inventory to more efficiently incorporate older vehicles. [Fine] [Ph] vehicles at appropriate prices for market conditions is one of our core competencies. We bought approximately 343,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the second quarter. While down 8% versus last year's period, this was up approximately 50% from the second quarter of FY'21, and reflects customers' responsiveness to both our nation-wide online instant offer tool and our offers. We purchased approximately 323,000 cars from consumers in the quarter, down 11% versus last year's record results. We also sourced approximately 20,000 vehicles through MaxOffer, our digital appraisal product for dealers. This was up 130% versus last year's period, and up 18% compared to this year's first quarter. Our sales efficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We remain focused on providing the most customer-centric experience in the industry, with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates buying and selling cars with our best-in-class store experience. In regard to our second quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from 9% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 53% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, down, slightly, from 55% in the prior year's quarter. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so, 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%. This is up from 28% in last year's second quarter. CarMax Auto Financer Cap delivered income of $183 million, down from $200 million during the same period last year. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic. We will continue to provide strong credit offers to our customers as we move rates with the market. Jon will provide more detail in customer financing, the loan loss provision, and cap contributions in a few minutes. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance as well as the steps we are taking to further align our expenses to the current sales environment. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.79, down from $1.72 a year ago. Total gross profit was $737 million, down 9.6% from last year's second quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by wholesale vehicle margin of $141 million, which was down 26%. The year-over-year decrease was driven by both lower volume and margin per unit. As Bill noted, we faced sharp depreciation throughout the quarter, and have been adjusting accordingly to better position ourselves to manage through the current environment. Total used vehicle margin was down slightly, at $495 million, a decrease of 2%. Total used unit volume, of negative 6.4%, was largely offset by higher margin per unit. Other gross profit was $102 million, down 15% from last year's second quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effect of lower retail unit sales on service. Service results declined $13 million as lower sales and, secondarily, impacts from inflationary pressures drove a deleverage in results. EPP fell by 3% or $3 million, reflecting the combined effects of stronger margins, stable penetration at approximately 60%, and a decline in retail unit sales. Third-party finance fees were flat over last year's second quarter as lower volume in fee-generating Tier 2 were offset by lower Tier 3 volume, for which we pay a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $666 million. Up 16% from the prior year's quarter reflecting a slowdown from the year-over-year increase during the first quarter. Approximately three points of the increase this quarter reflects a change in an accounting estimate in the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 90.4% from 70.4% during the second quarter last year. A key contributor of deleverage was a 9.6% decrease in total gross margin dollars compared to last year's quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was mainly due to two factors. First, a $50 million increase in other overhead. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms, strategic and growth initiatives, a $14 million onetime impact from a prior year change in an accounting estimate related to non-CAF uncollectible receivables, and a variety of other smaller cost headwinds. Second, a $34 million increase in compensation and benefits excluding share-based compensation. Primarily driven by the annualization of the strong growth in staffing we experienced in the back half of last year as well as wage pressures. Partially offsetting this increase was a $4 million decrease in share-based compensation. During our first quarter earnings call, we discussed how we have actively taken steps to better align our staffing expenses in our stores and customer experience centers or CECs to the sales levels we were experiencing at the time. However, as Bill noted, sales declined sharply in the second quarter versus our expectations, starting in July. Accordingly, during the second quarter we pulled additional levers to further align our expenses to our sales levels. We expect these savings will materialize more fully in the coming quarters. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs, pausing on a portion of the hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices as well as better aligning marketing spend to sales. In regard to marketing, our intent is to continue to maintain a strong level investment on a per unit basis that is at least consistent with the full-year FY '22 levels. For the second quarter, total marketing dollars were flat year-over-year but reflected a robust investment on a per unit basis. As part of our omni channel journey, we have reduced the variable cost component of our operating structure. Given the macro-environment, our near-term priority will be on allocating resources towards those initiatives that will further drive efficiency and effectiveness across our fixed cost. At the same time, we will continue to selectively invest in customer facing initiatives that will enhance our omni channel experience and support our long-term growth. From a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 38% to 45%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares from $163 million. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. Once again, the CarMax auto finance business delivered solid results while transitioning from a lending environment that has seen historically low levels of credit loss and extremely favorable funding cost. During the second quarter, CAF's net loans originated was over $2.3 billion. CAF's penetration in the second quarter net of three day payoffs was 41.2% compared with 43% last year and 39.3% in Q1. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9.4%, which was higher than the 8.5% in last year's second quarter and the 9% seen in Q1. This rate increase combined with the quarter-over-quarter increase in penetration affects CAF's ability to strategically pass along a portion of the added funding cost to consumers while still providing highly competitive offers. Our lending partners continue to complement each other in also providing attractive credit offers. Our Tier 2 penetration rate was consistent with last year, 21.6%. And Tier 3 accounted for 6% of used unit sales compared with 7.2% year ago. Although the lower credit consumer continuous to show demand by actively shopping and applying for credit, they continue to be challenged with affordability and being able to complete the purchase. CAF income for the quarter was $183 million, a decrease of 8.6% or $17 million from the same period last year. Last year, our loan loss provision of $35 million was a significant tailwind as the overall performance of the consumer remained remarkably strong. This quarter's $76 million provision resulted in ending reserve balance of $478 million or 2.92% of managed receivables, up from 2.85% last quarter. The seven basis point adjustment is once again predominantly attributed to the proportionately higher quarterly volume of Tier 2 and Tier 3 loan originations compared to the pre-existing $16 billion portfolio. Of note, as the macroeconomic conditions posed a challenge to the credit consumer, we remain confident in our ability to leverage our vast experience and robust credit platform to ensure our Tier 1 credit losses remain comfortably within our targeted operating range of 2% to 2.5%. As was seen last quarter, our provision headwind was significantly offset by our total interest margin, which grew $31 million year-over-year, our margin of 7.29% was up 11 basis points from last year's second quarter, and it was supported by a $9.4 million benefit from our hedging strategy. Regarding our industry-leading online finance experience, during the quarter, we significantly expanded our pre-qualification product launched in March. As a reminder, this unique multi-lender product results in no impact your credit score, and generates customized real time credit decisions on our full inventory. As of the end of the second quarter, this product was available to over 50% of our consumers, and is expected to go nationwide during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. Given the realities of the macro environment, we will further sharpen our focus on driving additional operational efficiencies as we continue to navigate the near-term pressures facing the used car industry. At the same time, we will remain focused on continuing our work to achieve our long-term goals, including further improving our omni channel experience for both our customers and associates, as well as growing our diversified business model. Some of our key initiatives include first, we're leveraging data science, automation and AI to improve efficiency and effectiveness within our customer experience centers. During the second quarter, we expanded our Associate Facing Guided Action software, from chat to phone calls, and develop additional work streams for our consumer facing digital assistant. Over time, we anticipate these tools will enable us to reduce associate time spent per customer as we enhance our ability to provide live interactions at the highest value moments. Second, as Jon mentioned, we continue to scale our industry leading finance base shopping experience. This best-in-class pre-qualification product leverages a streamlined, simple application and generates multi-lender credit terms on cards within our retail inventory in just minutes. With this tool, customers have all the information they need to quickly understand APRs and monthly payments across different contract terms, and effortlessly compare vehicles to ultimately secure the right financing options for them. Third, we're expanding Max offer to acquire vehicles and build on our market leading position as a buyer of cars. As a reminder, buying directly from consumers and dealers lowers our acquisition costs, enhances our inventory selections, and provides profitable incremental wholesale volume. We're currently live in over 40 markets and anticipate launching additional markets later this year. Finally, we're upgrading our auction experience to be even more user friendly. We're testing a modernized vehicle detail page to be mobile friendly and efficiently display the most relevant information dealers need to preview our wholesale inventory, similar to how customers shop our retail inventory. We're also testing AI capabilities to enhance our online vehicle condition reporting. In addition, we have rolled out self-service checkout capabilities nationwide. These tools will enable us to drive incremental operational efficiencies as we continue to scale our wholesale volume, all while providing an even better experience to our wholesale dealers. As I close, I want to reiterate that while the market conditions and consumer behaviors remain challenging, we believe that these pressures are transitory and that our foundation remains strong. We're well-positioned to navigate this environment as we have during challenging times in the past and remain excited about the future of our diversified business. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Samira? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Okay, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sure there will be several macro questions, but I'd like to ask about your sourcing tool. I'm a little surprised to see an 11% drop in vehicles sourced from consumers. Given the secular momentum you've had with your online instant appraisal tool, can you shed a little more light on the traction you're seeing with that online instant appraisal tool, and whether the slower pace is a function of the slower traffic online or is it a decision to buy more selectively? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, Craig, thank you for the question. And, look, I think it goes back to a couple things. First of all, we're really excited about both our online offer tool and the MaxOffer that I talked about earlier. While we did see a decline, the environment, I think the biggest factors of that decline, one, which I already highlighted, was the fact that we're moving -- kind of change the retail selectivity to take in some of those wholesale cars, and putting them over in retail, which if you take that out it would then mean our decline was less than 10%. Depreciation, you know, you've followed us long enough, any time we get into depreciating market, we're lowering our offers. That has an impact on what you ultimately end up buying from consumers. And I would say the third thing, which is smaller than the other two, but we actually -- we slowed some of our buys in certain pockets in certain geographic areas, in certain price points either because we didn't the cars or just because the dynamics of the quickly-changing environment. So, I think those are the three factors that really led to the decline. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, wanted to focus on just the trend in the quarter with the used car unit sales, so, Bill, you talked in your prepared comments about the market slowdown that began in July. So, my question there is, is there anything in -- you know, are macro pressures are very well documented out there, but there is anything you noticed in particular that could explain that slowdown? Did you see some variable [leaks] [Ph] geographically, or your cost of the product spectrum? And then there's a quick follow-up within that question, any comments on how the business is tracking here into Q3, and September, in particular? Bill Nash : Yes, Brian, it's a great question. If you remember the last call, I talked a little bit about June and how we were feeling good about June because it was doing better than the first quarter. And as I said, we saw a big drop-off in July. And then that softness continued into August, where we ended up in a mid-teen decline for comps. And there's not one single thing that I can point to that we can say, \"Oh, because this happened in July is why we saw the drop-off.\" I mean, there's lots of, I think, pressures out there. I talked about the broad inflationary pressures. Obviously, consumers are having to make decisions; groceries are higher than ever. I think we've seen more interest rates' increases, consumer confidence, certainly during the quarter, all-time low as far as recent history, I mean even lower then the height of the pandemic. So, I just think consumers are prioritizing their spend a little differently. But there's not one single thing that I can point to, like, \"Oh, this happened, and that's why we saw the decline.\" I think it's just the continuation -- kind of the deterioration of the overall consumer. Moving into September, we're seeing the same softness that we saw in August. And I would tell you, even more recently, just given the hurricane, as you can imagine, that's contributing to additional softness as well. Now, the thing with hurricanes or any weather events, you generally will flow -- get that back later on. But as far as September goes, it will absolutely put pressure. We have about -- let's see, 22 stores are currently closed, and have been closed for varying amounts of time. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And we've also seen on the wholesale side and just from a depreciation standpoint, just a continuation of that depreciating environment that we saw in the first quarter as well. So, that has continued into September. Brian Nagel : Right. Could you ask a follow-up, I'll make it quick, I apologize? But just -- so you're talking about the depreciation in the wholesale. I mean should that lead then to more attractive prices in the used car business and potentially undermine what has been a significant challenge for consumers? Bill Nash : Yeah, I think you're thinking about it right way, Brain. And, in fact, I believe this is probably the first quarter where the gap between used and new got a little bit wider in, gosh, probably six or seven quarters, you know. So, it'll take some time. But I think depreciation and prices correcting on used will absolutely benefit the used the used market over time. But I think we got to keep in perspective this quarter was challenging. I mean, we haven't seen $2,500 in depreciation; that rivals -- in absolute dollars, that rivals back what we saw at the height of the Great Recession, that rivals what we saw at the peak of omni. So, it's a very unusual thing and it brings challenges. But I think that we've proven, over time, that we've been able to navigate those and that we'll do it better than pretty much anyone. Brian Nagel : I appreciate it. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Sharon Zackfia : So, I've followed the company long enough to see that navigate a lot of different cycles. And congratulations on continuing to gain market share, although I'm sure it's small solace with the comp trends that you're seeing. I guess, historically, you haven't been a company that really has done layoffs materially, if at all. Obviously, you've swallowed, it sounds like, staffing acquisitions and open to hires. But I'm curious, just given the retraction in profitability here -- or you kind of erased, I think, seven years of profit in this quarter. I mean, how do we think about those initiatives, Enrique, that you talked about in terms of slowing SG&A spend, because -- and there's certainly scenarios that I can get to where SG&A spend exceeds gross profit in the back-half of the year, and as we go into kind of the seasonally slower time. So, help us think about kind of how much money you can take out right now, whether that's in SG&A as a percent of gross profit or SG&A dollar growth, just any kind of barometers whether it'd be mark-to-market, where sales are, we have an idea of where that SG&A spend is kind of coming in? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, thanks for the question, Sharon. And our objective is on winning in the long-term. And that really requires that we remain focused on making the right investments to continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. So, we have an active and accretive portfolio of omni-related initiatives that we've been investing in that we've been able to do that, in large part because of our strong balance sheet and our performance, but that being said, certainly -- so, with the current macro environment, we have started to pull the levers, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to better align our cost structure to the current environment. And we're also going to be tilting our resources more towards initiatives that drive efficiencies that I talked about, and Bill talked about in our prepared remarks as well. So, be slowing some of the velocity down on our growth-related investments, but certainly not pulling back. So, I think we're doing the right things at the current moment in terms of better managing our costs. We have a strong and active eye on the consumer, and we stand very experienced in managing through these cycles. But we also want to make sure that when the industry picks back up, that we're in a really strong position to capture the upside. So, I think in terms of the balance of the year and how to look at SG&A, we do expect the levers that we pulled during the second quarter will start to manifest themselves more fully over the next few quarters. I think the other component, certainly not in kind of an leverage, is purely just the gross profit, right, and where that stands to be in the fourth quarter and moving into next year, that's another factor. But we can control, certainly, very strongly is the SG&A. So, we feel good that we pulled the levers -- the appropriate levers for the time being. Bill Nash : Yes. And then, Sharon, the only other thing I would add to that, that we're absolutely entering this from a position of strength. And to Enrique's point, there's lots of lever. I mean just from the expense side, there's a lot of growth expense that we're continuing right now to prepare ourselves for the future, there's these initiatives, there's advertising, there's variable spend; all those we can still pull on, not to mention there's a whole host of other levers just for -- to preserve cash if that's ever needed. So, I think where we are at this point is -- is, look, we've pulled the levers, we know it's a challenging time, we're coming at this from a position of strength. There's initiatives that we know that will help us, both, in the near-term and the long-term; let's get them done. And so, when this market turns, and it will turn; when it turns, we'll be able to take off because we've already done these things. But we will keep, absolutely, an eye to the outside environment. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Can I ask just as a follow-up, just given the mid-teens decline in comp trends we see in, I guess, [indiscernible] I mean, can you kind of mark-to-market for us what that is in terms of SG&A as a percent of gross profit? I mean, have you let it go over 100, or is that kind of mark where you would say, okay, now we have to pull back more? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. No, I think like we have said, we pull back on levers that we can control right now. We think we are better aligned with the current environment. You are going to see those savings manifest themselves kind of moving forward. We did pulled stronger levers kind of half way through the second quarter. So, you don't fully see it in this quarter's P&L, but moving forward, we should start to see more of the savings. Bill Nash : Yes. And I think, Sharon, way to think about it is, look, we had in absolute dollars an improvement in SG&A from the first to second as Enrique talked about. We would expect these dollars to manifest more. You will see a reduction there. The other wildcard in the equation that was just gross profit dollars, and that's going to be driven by the macro factors as Enrique talked about. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thank you for that. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hello, thanks for taking my questions. So, the first question I have was just around the wholesale side. If we should assume kind of similar trends in terms of volume and GPU pressure to start the third quarter and wholesale given the challenging macro? Bill Nash : Yes, Michael, good morning. So, previous calls I have talked about because I have gotten asked questions about retail margin and wholesale margin. And what I have said in previous quarters is all us being -- we feel pretty good about keeping strong retail margins. Wholesale would be coming under pressure. And if we are going to enter into a depreciating environment, that's going to cause the pressure like I talked about before. The other reason I mentioned that it could come under pressure is just because that retail selectivity, and because we are moving some cars older cars over to retail. And then, the corresponding what we call kicks. You say okay, this is retailer's car, you go build it. Or, you start to build and realize, okay, we can't get this to standards. We then move that back to wholesale. And we generally perform worse on those than the normal wholesale. So, we knew there was going to be some pressure. I think if you look at recent performance, let's call -- certainly last year, I think every quarter last year on GPU standpoint for wholesale was over $1000. And then you look at the year before, I think we had another quarter that was over $1000. If you look at that and then compare it to the 5 years prior to that, there were probably equal or more quarters in the last year than we had in the last 5 years over $1000. And that's because of the massive appreciation that we saw last year. So, I think the way to think about it going forward is probably more in line with what you would normally see the average wholesale that we make in any given quarter over 3, 4, 5 year period. I think that's the way to think about especially in this depreciating environment and especially as we continue to push more or try to push some more of these older vehicles over just from an affordability standpoint. Operator : And we will take our next question from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hey, Bill. I am sure your team is following the proposed rule making from the FTC that motor vehicle dealer's trade regulation rule that now collecting comments. And it's aimed to increase transparency on pricing and advertising and some downstream stuff like aftermarket add-on. So, if this rule making is approved, I know there is going to be a lot of puts and takes, have you guys done any preliminary work on what impact this might have on CarMax in terms of compliance cost or SG&A expense, or any potential revenue impacts? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, Adam, it's a great question. Obviously, we commented during the comment period as many folks did just because the requirements in some cases are a little onerous, we started to look at obviously whatever ultimately gets decided, we will make sure that we do follow, but we haven't put -- we aren't prepared at this point to really talk about additional expenses or anything, because again to your point, it's so much up in the air, and there is so much discussion and debate about it. There is a lot that's really unknown. Jon Daniels : One thing I will add though, I mean to your point, the verbiages, Adam, is that transparency and clarity around pricing add-on products et cetera. I think our business model sets us up perfectly for that. We already are very transparent, honest online. We can show our EPP products online, the pricing there. So, I think we are in a great position to do that. And obviously, we will do whatever is required. Bill Nash : And I think the motor bear complication for us, and I think really need to be looked as is some of the requirements on signing paperwork, physical signatures, managers that kind of thing. Everybody is operating in a world of online. So, again, it will be interesting to see how it pans out. Operator : We will take a question from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask a question on pricing. Year-over-year comparisons are always relevant, but sequentially as things are changing here, they might be more relevant than typically when you look at the retail price, yours was down about 2% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter and wholesale was down 7%. I mean, and you talked about doing sort of more older vehicles in that, in the retail side. So, I mean that 2% is absorbing even lower priced vehicles. So, the gap actually may be even larger between those two. And Bill, what are you seeing in the market, where retail pricing we're hearing this from a lot of other folks is, is holding up a fair amount better than wholesale pricing? I mean, do you think that the market is sort of anticipating dealers or anticipating some kind of weakness or looking to maintain growth, it seems like there's, things are softening but a lot more on the wholesale than they are on the retail side. Bill Nash : Yes, John, I think some of it has to do with timing. I mean, if you think about it, although there was depreciation in the quarter, and although as you pointed out, we have an older vehicle mix, both of those bring down your overall retail prices, but it wasn't enough to offset when comparing to like a year-ago. So, if you think about it, we ended last year with an appreciation about $7,500. We've only experienced about $2,500 in depreciation. So, that dynamic will become less and less as we get later into the year. But you're still there just wasn't enough to offset that overall appreciation which is why you still see us above last year. I think the other thing that you got to think about is a lot of the cars that were sold in the second quarter were bought actually; a majority of them were bought prior to the quarter even starting, so they're at a higher price. So, I think there's some, there's definitely some timing there. On the wholesale side, obviously if you're moving some of the nicer more expensive stuff into retail that's going to impact your wholesale a little bit more. And so, I think that's the dynamic that you have going on there. Operator : We will take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. I'm still a little lost on kind of how these hedges affect profitability, we quantified this quarter. And then to just like, given like bigger picture question, trying to take the impact in the next couple of years like given the decline in used volumes, the tightening in this securitization market spreads, and kind of defaults picking up a bit, can you just kind of maybe refresh us on how the fluctuations these variables impact loan originations and net margins so we can better model the cadence of cash going forward? Bill Nash : And maybe I'll jump in first on the hedge. Very similar dynamic to what we saw in the first quarter, right. So, the vast majority of our receivables are funded through the ABS market, as we know, we have accounting edge on those. However, we do have alternative financing vehicles with our banking partners; our longstanding banking partners and a portion of those receivables have a cash flow hedge but not an accounting hedge. And that's really due to our desire to maintain flexibility in our funding profile. So, those receivables are going to get mark-to-market every quarter like they did last quarter. And really where you see a change or benefit, or potential hit is when they're sharp and material rises or decreases in interest rates. And that's exactly what happened again this quarter. So, we would only expect this again to be material for capturing periods of material changes. And it's very similar to the first quarter. We saw sharp changes and movements in the interest rates. And that's what happened. And it was $9 million the same amount from the first quarter. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Great and I'll touch on your other question, Chris. And correct me if I don't cover everything you asked. But with regard to just overall interest margin, obviously, rising cost of funds that we've said, I think we signaled last quarter, you could begin to see a change in our net interest margin, maybe it's hit a peak and it could come down. And again, that's where our accounting is the way that we do our accounting benefits us. Obviously, as the margin increases over time, that higher margin receivable continues to hang around for longer. But obviously, our margins have tightened, had the hedge not been in there, we probably would have seen a downturn this quarter. And we're obviously going to be in a tighter environment. So, we maybe continue to see that come down. We're obviously on our side continuing to manage margins very carefully through our pricing. So, we'll do what we can, but still remaining competitive for our customer. So, again, I think there will be pressure on our net interest margin going forward. But again, we'll manage that as well as we can. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe there's a couple quick ones, first, on retail GPU, Bill, if I heard you correctly, you mentioned that you believe you could still maintain the current retail GPU level in the current pricing environment in the next few quarters. Did I hear that correctly, just want to clarify that and I have a follow-up. Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, sure. Rajat. So, when I was speaking -- talking about earlier, although I do feel good about being able to maintain strong retail margins, but I always will caveat that with, depending on a lot of different things, sales elasticity, what competitors are doing, inventory levels, our own inventory levels, so there's a lot that goes into it. But we really are still realizing some nice benefits from although we've lack self-sufficiency, we still feel like there's a little bit there. But then this, the fact that we are selling these older vehicles, gives us a little bit more margin, and this quarter, we were able to pass along some of it to the consumers in the form of offsetting some of the inflationary pressures, as well as take a little bit more. So, again, we feel good about our retail margins and where they are today. And we'll just continue to watch some of them or other external factors as we go forward. Rajat Gupta : Got it, got it. And maybe just to follow-up on Enrique's comments around advertising, looks like you want us to maintain a healthy advertising spend per unit. But just curious like in terms of like the focus of the company right now, is it more to make sure you are able to continue to gain market share or is it more around managing overall profitability with maybe higher interest rates or maybe lack of pricing discounts. Just curious as to like, what's really the strategy in the near-term? Is the one for the other, or you think you could get both at the same time to the volume and profitability? Bill Nash : Yes, so I'll answer and then I'll let -- I'll just give you some other thoughts and Enrique as you know but as far as advertising goes, as Enrique said, look we still are, we're really excited about this industry, and where the industry is going. Granted, we've got some challenging things, right now, but we still want to continue to invest in advertising, we're going to do it, we kind of think about it on a per unit level. So, ultimately advertising as a whole will come down if the sales are down, but we feel like continuing to invest in the business, not obviously you may change where you spend it, to this quarter, the majority of it was awareness and from an acquisition standpoint as more customers versus buying vehicles. But it's also one that we can continue to monitor, everything we do from an advertising standpoint, we measure ROI. And so, we have certain targets that we're going to have to if we see things that aren't panning out, we'll certainly pull back or pivot to something else that is. So, Enrique, you have any thoughts on that? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, what I would say is, compared to a few years ago, the marketing team overall has done a tremendous job of really giving us a line of sight, into profitability and the dollars, we're investing in how that then translates to an ROI. So, we feel really good about the investments we've been making over the past couple of years. If you compare ourselves to two years ago, I think we've increased the dollars per unit by over 50%, right. And that's because we feel really good about our ability to get visibility. So, I think we can continue to drive awareness and at the same time, drive that profitability. So, Rajat, I think we can get the best of both worlds. Bill Nash : Yes, I think the other thing that's important to remember too Rajat is we have a lot of great things going on, I'll give you an example. The pre-qualification that both Jon and I talked about, we haven't even -- we haven't even marketed that yet. And so, that's an area for opportunity. So, again, as we think about advertising, it really allows us to kind of okay, what do we want to highlight, we have to highlight online offers, we want to highlight the omni experience, we want to highlight being able to buy online, we're going to highlight pre-qualification, there's lots of things. So, we're constantly moving it around. So, again, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Rajat Gupta : Got it, got it. Maybe just on the cash piece, are you still able to do you feel comfortable being able to continue to pass on interest rate increases to the consumer? Or is that also going to be more thoughtful based on just more competitive lenders out there? Bill Nash : Yes, Rajat, I appreciate the question. Yes, as I said in my prepared remarks, I was extremely pleased with the penetration we had, it did show that we were able to pass along some of the increases on to our customers, yet still manage the elasticity, capture the volume that we could again, three things we're trying to manage here is stay highly competitive for our consumers from our offers standpoint, manage that margin, and then make sure that we can capture the right amount of sales and it's a delicate balance, but I think we've done a great job and I think we'll continue to do that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. My first question is on cash and just thinking about your loan loss reserves, and where you're at right now, what does that imply for what you're reserving, what your allowance rate is for your core Tier-1 securitized managed receivables? Bill Nash : Yes, so right now we are comfortably Seth within the 2% to 2.5% range. The increase that you saw, as I mentioned is predominantly coming from that Tier-2 and Tier-3 volume. That's a larger percentage in the new originations than it is in the portfolio. So, we feel real good about staying in that targeted range. And that's reflected in the reserve. Seth Basham : Got it. So, you haven't really taken up here allowance rate for those receivables despite the fact that we've seen collateral values come in sharply and the macro environment deteriorate? How should we think about the dynamics and the potential for higher loan losses for those core receivables? Bill Nash : Yes, we modelled that pretty extensively. And we felt like again, assuming there isn't just an absolute plummeting of the values, you've got people that are buying vehicles on our books that bought it five years ago, three years ago. So, there's obviously, it's been a slow ramp-up. And hopefully, it's a slow ramp down, but modeling that, it really was relatively immaterial in a $477 million reserve. So, we feel we are well reserved, we can absolutely absorb that in what we have today. So, we've considered it, but we think we've got the right reserve as it sits today. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Enderlin with Stephens. Please go ahead. Joe Enderlin : Hey guys, thanks for taking our question. So, a question for the older vehicle mix as the vehicle buy normalizes, could you see these older vehicles remain part of the mix to support higher GPUs than historical levels? Or how are you thinking about that moving forward? Bill Nash : Yes, no, it's a great question. The great thing about that is we now that we have so much more of that inventory available, we can put out whatever the customer wants. So, as we go forward, and maybe get to a more normalized area, or period, if consumers are looking for this, we can we now have a source to make sure that we put it out there. So, I think this also will benefit us. If you think about the fact that new cars right now there aren't as many being sold, they'll have to be something that fills that gap. This is a great -- I think this will be a great tool to do that. So, again, we'll put out there, whatever the consumers want. Joe Enderlin : Got it. Thank you, guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll pick our next question from David Whiston with Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning, buyback spending was roughly flat from Q1. Stocks, obviously a lot cheaper now, but of course, there's macroeconomic pressures, which can make one want to conserve cash, it's that delicate balance. But do you anticipate being able to be at least flat in second half versus first half? Are you going to pull back on buybacks or be even more aggressive? Bill Nash : Hey, David. Yes, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out in the second quarter, we're on the same pace as we were in the first quarter. So, continue to buy back our shares, but I tell you that our capital allocation philosophy remains the first and foremost, our cash goes into growing the core business. So, that's our retail businesses, our wholesale businesses, our cash business in making sure those are in a position to continue to grow. From there, we also look for growth opportunities, investments that we make, and then we return capital back to shareholders. So, our philosophy has remained the same. David Whiston : Okay, and just on your SG&A control, I just want to make sure I understand the comment you made earlier on staffing. Are you doing any replacement hiring if someone does leave voluntarily? Bill Nash : Yes, so, we absolutely -- we don't have a pause on hiring at this point. We're very strategic. We have a prioritization of hiring. So, as folks leave and the positions, critical positions we absolutely, we'll replace them, but at the same time, if you have a vacancy, you want to make sure okay, is this something that's supporting our near-term initiatives, that kind of thing, but while we've prioritized, we have not paused overall hiring. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, and just to be clear that managing headcount has also done through attrition as well, right, it's how we've been managing that. So, you will see those benefits again more sharply as we progress into the future quarters. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thank you. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Bill Nash for any additional or closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you. As always, I want to thank our associates for everything they do, how they take care of each other and the customers and the communities. Again, my thoughts are definitely with those being impacted by the Hurricane. Please, please stay safe. Thank you all for joining the call. And we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of widespread pressures across the used car industry. Vehicle affordability remain challenging due to macro factors stemming from broad inflation, climbing interest rates, and continued low consumer confidence. In addition, persistent and steep depreciation impacted wholesale values throughout the quarter. In response, we have been taking deliberate steps to support our business for both the short-term and for the long run. We are leveraging our strongest assets, our associates, our experience and our culture to manage through this cycle. Actions that we took during the quarter include further reducing SG&A, selling a higher mix of older lower priced vehicles, slowing buys in light of the steep market depreciation, maintaining used saleable inventory units while driving down total inventory dollars more than 25% year-over-year, raising caps consumer rates to help offset rising cost of funds, pausing share buyback to give us capital flexibility and slowing our planned store growth for next fiscal year to five locations while maintaining our ability to open more locations if market conditions change. In the near-term, we are prioritizing initiatives that unlock operational efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and our customers. While we continue to selectively invest in initiatives that have the potential to activate new capabilities, we have slowed the pace of those investments. We believe these steps will enable us to come out of this cycle leaner and more effective while positioning us for future growth. We will provide more details on these actions later during today's call. And now on to our results. For the third quarter of FY \u201823, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $6.5 billion, down 24% compared with last year's third quarter, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter declined 20.8% and used unit comps were down 22.4% versus the third quarter last year, when we achieved a 15.8% used unit comp. In addition to the macro factors that I mentioned previously, we believe our performance was impacted by transitory competitive responses to the current environment. External title data indicates that we gained market share on a year-to-date basis through October, though we've seen some recent loss of share. As we have said before, we are focused on profitable market share gains that can be sustained for the long-term. Through expansive price elasticity testing, we determined that holding margins during the quarter was the right profitability play. Third quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,237, which is consistent with last year's third quarter. Also unit sales were down 36.7% versus the third quarter last year, driven by rapidly changing market conditions, which included about $2,000 of depreciation. This is incremental to approximately $2,500 of depreciation experienced during the second quarter. Wholesale performance was also impacted as we continued to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower priced vehicles. Also, gross profit per unit was $966, down from a third quarter record of $1,131 a year ago. Recall, last year prices appreciated approximately $2,500 during the quarter, which was a margin tailwind. Just as we were doing in retail, we will continue to focus on maximizing total wholesale margin profitability. We bought approximately 238,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the third quarter, down 40% versus last year's period. Our volume was impacted by steep depreciation and our deliberate decision to slow buys in reaction to the depreciation. We purchased approximately 224,000 cars from consumers in the quarter with about half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. We also sourced about 14,000 vehicles through Max offer, our digital appraisal product for dealers, up 16% from last year's third quarter. Our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. In regard to our third quarter online metrics, approximately 12% of retail unit sales were online, up from 9% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 52% of retail unit sales were Omni sales this quarter, down from 57% in the prior year's quarter. Our wholesale auctions remained virtual, so 100% wholesale sales, which represent 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 28%, down from 30% during last year's third quarter. CarMax Auto Financer Cap delivered income of $152 million, down from $166 million during the same period last year. John will provide more detail on consumer financing, the loan loss provision, and cash contribution in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance and the steps we've taken to further align our business to the current sales environment. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.24, down from $1.63 a year ago. Total gross profit was $577 million, down 31% from last year's third quarter. Used retail margin of $403 million and wholesale vehicle margin of $115 million declined 21% and 46%, respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across used and wholesale and lower wholesale margin per unit. As Bill noted, we continue to face depreciation and have been adjusting accordingly to better position ourselves to manage through the current environment. Other gross profit was $59 million, down 49% from last year's third quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effect of lower retail unit sales on service and EPP. Service results declined $37 million has lower sales and secondarily, our decision to maintain technician staffing levels drove some deleveraging. Technicians are among the most in-demand associates in the industry, and their retention will position us strongly to quickly grow inventory when we exit the current cycle. EPP fell by 14% or $15 million, reflecting the decline in sales that was partially offset by stronger margins and a favorable year-over-year returned reserve adjustment. Penetration was stable at approximately 60%. Third-party finance fees were relatively flat over last year's third quarter with lower volume and fee generating Tier-2 offset by lower Tier-3 volumes for which we pay a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter were $592 million, up 3% from the prior year's quarter, reflecting a slowdown from the year-over-year increases of 19% during the first quarter and 16% during the second quarter of this year. In the prior year's third quarter, we received a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. Adjusting for that settlement, SG&A actually would have declined 1% year-over-year this quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was materially pressured as compared to the third quarter last year, due primarily to the 31% decrease in total gross margin dollars compared to last year's quarter. The change in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following factors. First, a $41 million increase in other overhead primarily driven by cycling over last year's legal settlement. We also continue to invest, although at a reduced pace in our technology platforms and strategic and growth initiatives. Second, an $18 million reduction in compensation and benefits, including a $16 million decrease in share-based compensation, and third, a $17 million reduction in advertising. During the quarter, we continue to take steps to better align our expenses to our sales. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs limiting hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices and continuing to align our marketing spend to sales. While our advertising expense was lower year-over-year, our investment on a per unit basis remains consistent with last year's third quarter. We remain focused on reducing expenses and anticipate continued progress in the fourth quarter. Regarding capital structure, our first priority is to fund the business. Given third quarter performance and continued market uncertainties, we are taking a conservative approach to our capital structure. While our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was below 35% to 45% targeted range. We are managing our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. In keeping with this goal of maintaining flexibility, we took the following steps this quarter in addition to the SG&A actions I spoke to. First, we paused our share buybacks. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place, as does our commitment to return capital back to shareholders over time. Second, we slowed the velocity of our CapEx spend, we expect CapEx will end the fiscal year at approximately $450 million versus our previous $500 million estimate. As Bill mentioned, we have also conservatively planned store growth of five new locations in fiscal year 2024. Our liquidity remains very strong. We ended the quarter with over $680 million in cash on the balance sheet and no draw on our $2 billion revolver. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the strength and stability of our credit platform provided approvals to over 95% of the consumers who applied for credit during their shopping journey. CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.1 billion within the quarter, resulting in a penetration of 44.4% net three-day payoffs up from 42.2% realized in the same quarter last year and 41.2% in Q2. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9.8%, which was higher than the 8.3% in last year's third quarter and a 9.4% seen in Q2. We continue to leverage our scalable testing environments and nimble underwriting infrastructure to strategically pass along a portion of the increased funding costs to consumers while still increasing share of the finance contracts. Tier-2 penetration in the quarter was 20.5% in line with historical levels, but down from last year's 22.2%. Tier-3 have financed 6.1% of used unit sales compared to 6.5% a year ago. Our lenders continued to make their own independent lending decisions in this challenging environment, and we remain pleased with the competitive offers they are collectively able to provide to our customers. CAF income for the quarter was $152 million, a decrease of 8.3% or $14 million from the same period last year. Our loan loss provision was $86 million, resulting in an ending reserve balance of $491 million. This is compared to a provision of $76 million in last year's Q3. The current quarter's reserve of $491 million is 2.95% of managed receivables up slightly from 2.92% at the end of this year second quarter. This sequential three basis point adjustment in reserves to receivables ratio, comes primarily from the continued addition of Tier-2 and Tier-3 receivables to the overall portfolio as seen in previous quarters. All in all, we were pleased with the credit performance within our portfolio during the quarter, we believe we are appropriately reserved for future losses. Further, we continue to be in a strong position to leverage our unique credit platforms to operate our Tier-1 business within our targeted loss range up 2% to 2.5%. Within the quarter, total interest margin dollars were flat to last year at $277 million modestly supported by a $5 million benefit from our hedging strategy. The corresponding margin to receivables rate 6.7% was down 54 basis points year-over-year as receivables with historically low funding costs are offset by the receivables impacted by the more recent Fed moves. Regarding advancements in our broader credit technology, during the third quarter, we successfully completed the nationwide rollout of finance-based shopping, our multilinear pre-qualification product, and we continue to see a high level of engagement with this experience. As a reminder, this gives customers the ability to digitally receive quick credit decisions across our entire inventory be our simple online application with no impact to credit scores. This also allows consumers to quickly and easily secure financing at any point in their shopping journey. Like the rest of the business, CAF is also focused on driving efficiencies. We are already seeing benefits from the modern, more nimble receivable servicing system that we launched a year ago. Consumer finance is a highly regulated and everchanging space. And our new system allows us to adapt more easily to these necessary changes. A recent example is California's upcoming regulatory change that requires added disclosure and refund requirements related to the cancellation of the GAP waiver product. With our old system, the implementation would have been lengthy and onerous, and we likely would have temporarily suspended the product in the state while we made the changes. However, with our new more agile technology, we are able to incorporate these requirements without interrupting. This is just one example of our early wins resulting from our new system, and we have a clear line of sight to many more in the near and midterm. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon, and thank you, Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of today's call, we're taking steps to support our business by prioritizing projects that unlock operating efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and customers. It starts with making our omni-channel experience faster, simpler and more seamless. Some examples include, we're enhancing online features to help customers feel more confident in completing key transaction steps on their own and make it easier to go back and forth between assisted help and self-progression. We're also making it simple for consumers to opt into express pickup through self-progression. This delivery option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in as little as 30 minutes and represents a win-win opportunity. Our research shows that customers love this experience when utilized and it will enable us to lower our costs over time. Our final example is that we are working to seamlessly integrate our finance base shopping product into our stores and customer experience centers so that all consumers can enjoy this experience, not just those who shop online. At the same time, we are adding additional lenders to the platform to expand the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers. As we evolve our omni-channel experience, we are also updating our operating models to drive efficiency gains in our stores. For example, in our business offices, we have launched self-check-in capabilities for appraisal customers and have also enhanced e-sign functionality to better enable self-progression. Additionally, we are testing an improved digital customer queue to better manage appointments, as well as new software to improve title speed and visibility. We anticipate these tools will enable us to reduce associate time spent per customer and shorten customer transaction times. Our associates are key to providing an exceptional customer experience and we are focused on leveraging their skills in the most value-added manner. We will also continue to selectively invest in key projects that have the potential to deliver new capabilities while lowering our costs. Examples include first, we're updating Max offer our appraisal product for dealers, which is available in approximately 50 markets. Many of our dealers are still on the initial version, which does not provide instant offers and requires them to take and send us vehicle pictures. We are rolling out a new product which offers a fully digital instant offer experience to all dealers. We believe this will well position us to grow our dealer, dealer buys more efficiently and support higher volume over time. Second, we are leveraging technology to enhance our logistics capability. We move approximately 2 million vehicles each year. We estimate that our internal logistics operation drives about a 20% cost advantage over third-party providers and improves our speed, predictability and control of moves. Enhancements to our transportation management system will enable us to consolidate loads, increase our mix of full loads and reduce the truck volume in and out of our stores. This will support our ability to keep our costs low as we complete moves even faster and more efficiently. Third, we're continuing to upgrade our auction experience. During the third quarter, we scaled our modernized vehicle detail page to 50% of dealers. This page is mobile friendly provides more relevant data to our dealers, and improved search and filter functionality. It is also the springboard that we will use to launch capabilities we believe will further enhance our wholesale business, including AI enhanced condition reports and proxy bidding. We are confident that our focus initiatives will drive efficiencies and grow our business over the long-term. In closing, we have spent almost 30 years building a diversified business that can profitably navigate the ups and downs of the used car industry. We have a strong balance sheet and access to capital. Our experience in inventory and margin management is a strength and we will continue to be thoughtful and manage our expenses pulling levers as necessary. While we're not able to predict how long the industry will remain challenged, we believe the pressures are transitory and that we are well positioned to manage through them and emerge an even stronger company. I want to thank our associates for everything that they're doing to support each other, our customers and our business, our foundation remains strong, and we're excited about the future of our diversified business model. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Ashley? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : So I guess the question I have just with regard to sales. And maybe Bill, if you could discuss a bit more just this trend of sales through the quarters, we understand better, how the business is performing here. And then also, you mentioned in your comments that you saw market share declines, if you will, I guess later in the period. It sounds like that was a result of others taking more aggressive actions on price. You can elaborate further there. Who's doing what, what cohort of your competition is doing that? And how long should it -- how long would you expect that dynamic to persist? And then, I guess a follow up to that, as you look at your business and CarMax has historically been very, very good at managing inventories. But you're starting to see now others take more aggressive action on price, and you've held the wider margin. Could there be percolating issues within your inventory? Bill Nash : All right. There's a lot in there, Brian. So let me start with sales during the quarter. The last time we spoke, it was middle of September, latter part of September, we talked about sales being down in the mid-teens, it actually got a little softer by the end of September and it continued. We continue to see even more softness in October and November. I'll save you from having to get back into the queue because I'm sure your next question is, well, how's December panning out? December is actually running about where the quarter -- the third quarter ran on average. So it's a little bit better than November. But I would just remind you that we're also going to be -- we're comping over a little bit of easier performance, obviously, than we were from the third quarter that we will be doing in the fourth quarter. As far as market share, giving you some detail on market share declines. Year-to-date, like you said, we've still got -- we still have gains in share. We did see declines most recently in September and October, which is the latest title data that we have. But this speaks to -- I always hesitate talking about market share on the short-term basis because sometimes there are some temporary pressures. And we saw competitors lowering prices and margins to move inventory, which I'll be honest, it's not surprising. I mean, we saw a very similar play back in '08, '09 recession. It's also the reason that we did much more expansive pricing elasticity testing. And through those tests, we're confident that even though we would have sold more cars if we had lowered the prices, we actually would have made -- we made less money. And as I said in my opening remarks, and what I've always says we're always, what we're going after is profitable on a long-term market share gains, and I think we've got a great track record on that. I think your other question was just who's getting that look. This is a highly dispersed business lots and lots of players out there. I can't point to any of them. I just know that widespread pressures of folks trying to move their inventory and get rid of it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Maybe, first thing just on retail GPU, obviously, very well managed, again, this quarter. You talked about the fact that you're not discounting as much as some of your competitors. But at some point, you have to move the inventory that you have, it seems like it's aging -- and it's getting older on the lot. So like what gives ultimately, I mean, what do you have to consider the discounting at some point to move that inventory out the door, if not this quarter, maybe the next quarter? So how do you manage that transition? And how should we think about implications to retail GPU maybe in the next quarter or two through that pricing position? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Bill Nash : So, Rajat great question. This is where I think we really shine when it comes to inventory management, I'm really pleased. If you notice, I talked about how much our total inventory has gone down, but we were able to maintain saleable units. And that's because the team did a phenomenal job, really cleaning up stuff that we had, whether we\u2019re waiting on parts, missing titles, we really worked hard to clean up a lot. So to your point, the aging inventory, it's one of the reasons why you didn't see more movement in our ASPs. Our average selling price is given the depreciation, the team did a phenomenal job working through that getting it out there. And then with our sophisticated price testing, we just realized, look, there's no sense and given this away. And so again, we feel like we put ourselves in really good position going forward. And I think what you'll see going forward is, your retail average selling prices are going to come down a lot more than what you've seen up to this point. So we feel good about retail GPU. Obviously, we will continue to test the elasticity as we go forward. But if elasticity holds, I think you'll see us continue to have robust retail GPUs. Rajat Gupta : Got it. And maybe like, the other gross profit line, if I look at the volume that you did three years ago, very similar to the volumes that you have today, really slightly lower today. And that other gross profit was $94 million and now $59 million, despite your third-party financing fee is actually better. So why is that like down almost 50% on a similar level of volume? I mean, is there any opportunity to reduce the cost there. And I know, you mentioned that you want to retain the technicians, but how long are we going to see this kind of run rate before it can recouple to what you had in the past? And thanks for taking the question. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, specifically with the other margin, what you really need to do is look within the service business, and this quarter a couple of things. Number one was just with sales volumes being where they were down 20% year-over-year, that places a fair bit of deleverage pressure on the service business. That's number one. But number two, have almost equal importance this quarter, about $15 million year-over-year was our decision, the correct decision is to hold on to technicians. It's a very difficult position to staff, it is that most important that we retain, and we recruit the technicians because when we come out of this cycle, we want to be in a position where we can actually ramp up our inventory quickly, faster than our competitors. But that being said, it is an investment that flows through that service line. And again, this quarter was roughly $15 million given the current sales levels, but it's absolutely the right decision for the medium-term and definitely for the longer-term. That was the biggest pressure this quarter, Rajat. Bill Nash : Yes. Rajat, the only thing I would add is, obviously, you're comparing it to a few years ago, we have a lot more production capacity now, because we have more technicians, we have more space. So that's feeding into it as well. Rajat Gupta : Sorry, just a follow-up. What's your view on the cycle recovery? I mean, like, are you anticipating things like rebound at some point next year? Or I mean, what kind of conviction do you have on that like, just so that you might have to take some of these kind of actions, more aggressively? Just curious on the thought process there. Bill Nash : Yes. Look Rajat, your guess as far as what's going to happen next year as good as mine. I think what we're trying to do is put ourselves in a position that regardless of what happens in the upcoming quarters, will flex up or if we need to pull additional levers will pull additional levers. So we're just trying to give ourselves flexibility at this point. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I mean, we are laser focused on what we can control. And that's what we're taking actions on. And so you can take a look at our SG&A and how we've bent the curve there. You can take a look at service, yes, it's up. But again, there's -- the reason it's up is, that we're investing in our technicians, because we know that we're going to get through this cycle. And when we emerge from that, we want to be in a really strong position to reduce cars quickly. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : We will take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Just wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the SG&A cadence. I appreciate the comp cadence, but I was just wondering if you could help us think about the actions you took in Q3. And maybe the run rates and really, I don't know if we can think about an SG&A to gross kind of level for the next couple of quarters, or just help us understand kind of, what might be reasonable for you guys, just because there's been a lot of growth SG&A. And now it sounds like you're calibrating that. So anything you could provide there would be helpful? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, great. Thank you, John. Yes, like I said, in my prepared remarks, we have significantly bent the curve on our SG&A go back to the first half of the year as a whole, it was up 16% to 17% year-over-year. We've bend that down to 3%, year-over-year growth this quarter. But again, when you back out the $23 million settlement that we received last year in the third quarter, you're really looking at a slight decrease in overall SG&A. So pretty material change in the curve. We would expect that to carry forward into the fourth quarter and into next year. And why is that? It's because it's the actions we've been talking about, right. And that's really kind of two groups of actions. Number one is on the more variable perspective, we've been lowering our headcount, lowering our staffing, from an attrition basis in our stores. So that actually takes a little bit more time, right, because you're managing it through attrition, but we believe it's the right thing to do from a culture standpoint. And that has been bleeding down really, since the second quarter, when we started talking about it, we expect that'll carry forward to the fourth quarter and into next year. The second piece is really taking a look at our fixed costs and actively managing there as well. So I've talked about looking at our uses of -- our usage of contractors in the corporate home office, we've pulled back there, right. And we've also essentially paused our hiring in the corporate office. We are still hiring backfills and key positions that we have as well, kind of strategic positions as well, by materially, so we've kind of paused our corporate overhead hiring as well. So we've taken strong actions, we believe they're appropriate actions for the marketplace that we're operating in. If we need to take further actions, we would do that as well, if required, but we believe we're strongly positioned right now. And to answer your question about like the cadence, I would expect the fourth quarter to look similar to the third quarter once you back out the settlement from last year. John Healy : And when you say relatively similar to the Q3, would that be in terms of dollars, or would that be in terms of SG&A to gross? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. So it's more of a year-over-year SG&A and how that's moving, it's not to grow? So I think the challenge, John with the leverage ratio, the SG&A to gross profit is we can control SG&A. And I believe we've been doing that effectively. The challenge is the gross profit number. So depending on where that gross profit number ends up and sharp movements, quarter-to-quarter make it really difficult to manage that leverage ratio. So in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, we'll control what we can control. And that's what we're focused on. We're focused on that SG&A line. So I would -- my comments are specifically about SG&A growth year-over-year and the quarter. John Healy : Perfect, thank you. And just one follow up question just about the gross profit per unit levels. I feel like you've kind of already answered this, but just want to ask it maybe in a different way. Hypothetically, if ASPs fall another 5% to 10% over the next couple of quarters either given market conditions or just changing of mix? Are you guys still confident that the $2200 GPU level is achievable? And even in that scenario, so I just wanted to ask that more directly. Bill Nash : Yes. Look, I think we feel very comfortable where we're running the retail GPUs. We'll continue to monitor the test. But look, I expect ASPs to continue to fall, which I think overall for the industry is a good thing to help drop some gap between new and late model use. So we feel comfortable with where our GPUs are and will continue to test. John Healy : Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : I want to follow up on John's question on expenses. Enrique, can you just provide some more color around really what the biggest inflationary drivers are in that other overhead costs fine? I think you pulled back, you said on some of the labor end of the season, and it's still up, $40 million year-over-year. So is any of that one-time increase? And then just taking a step back on expenses, I think even last quarter, we talked about, one of the reasons that you don't want to reduce headcount too quickly, is the need to hire back. And that gets harder next year. But now it sounds like we're expecting a softer backdrop for the next 12 plus months. So I guess why not reduce expenses or headcount more quickly across other parts of the enterprise? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. And what I'd say there is that, we did, and so as sales got more challenged in the third quarter, we went deeper into the staffing levels in the field. And so, it's still through attrition. So it does take a little bit longer. But at the same time, we did lower our staffing targets to reflect the current sales environments, I tell you, we did go deeper into managing those expenses. And in regards to your first question, I think you're asking about the other expense line, and what goes in there, because it was a 41% increase, if you just look at the release, right? That is primarily because we're comping over the $23 million settlement that we had last year, if you back that out, you're looking at less than half of that as an increase. And what that really is attributed to is our investments in technology and product, right. And that's what that's attributed to. What I will tell you, though, as well, if you compare it to prior quarters, there is a reduction in the pace of that investment from a year-over-year standpoint. And so we've been pulling back there as well. You also see that manifested in our CapEx guidance for this year. We've taken that down from 500 to 450, the largest chunk of that decrease, really comes from a slowing down some of those projects, in addition to just slowing down some of the capacity initiatives that we have out there in terms of growing our capacity with lower volume, we're just slowing down some of those investments. Bill Nash : And Daniel the only thing I would add there is, look, our culture is one that's a people first mindset, our people are the reason for our success. And that's the reason we chosen to allow attrition to get us to where we need to be. We will obviously continue to monitor the situation, but we're very comfortable with allowing attrition to get us to where we need to be. Daniel Imbro : Got it. I'll stick with one question. And I'll hop back in the queue for follow up. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : I just wanted to focus, sort of on the supply side here just for a second. I mean, when you think about the one- to six-year-old car fleet that's going to continue to probably shrink for the next couple of years. Competition is more focused on the [indiscernible], as you mentioned in the dealer. So it seems like the available one- to six-year-old car fleet is -- it's why is going to continue to shrink. But certainly what's available to you and other folks in the secondary market. But you've kind of mentioned going lower in the agent price spectrum, to drive volume. And you've shown an ability to kind of manage that fairly well. So I'm just curious, how fast you can move on that to potentially drive volume back up here, lower price points, but higher grosses, and maybe better returns, just on the capital employed. Bill Nash : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. It's interesting, because we're kind of living a very similar life to what we did after the '08, '09 recession, you remember where you come out of that you have less newer cars, and it kind of has to work its way through. I tell you, we're in a better position today than we were back there just because our self-sufficiency is so high. And we'll be able to sell what consumers are looking for. And we're going to be able to get that really, in a better way than we could after 08, 09 because our self-sufficiency is so high. In my opening comments, one of the reasons our buyers were down so far, obviously, depreciation was the biggest lever, but there's also we made some decision just to slow down buys. And so there were retail cars that we purposely did not buy because of the risk of those cars in a highly depreciating type of market. So, again, I'm very comfortable with where we are and I think we're better positioned than we were in 08, 09. And I think we did a phenomenal job in 08 and 09 navigating that period. John Murphy : But maybe a follow-up, Bill, I mean, how fast can you move on this to drive comps positive? I mean, we understand that kind of the headwinds in sort of what was traditionally your core. I mean, it is obvious, you know it. I mean, you're going after it. I mean, when do you kind of just push and just increase, maybe materially the penetration of these older vehicles to drive the volumes higher? Because, I mean, the one thing that, it's very admirable is that the variable, GPU or the focus on GPUs, which is a variable cost analysis, but you do have these fixed costs that are high, particularly as Enrique was talking about these technicians. So you got to cover these costs at some point not, I mean when can you do this? I mean, something you are stating to do and but you're not doing it? Bill Nash : Well, when you talk about penetration of older vehicles, but the penetration and how much we put out there is driven by the consumer demand, and not everybody wants an older, higher mileage type of vehicle that's less expensive. So again, that's all driven by demand. And as we see consumers continue to demand that will continue to put that out. But again, not everybody's -- not everyone's looking for that. John Murphy : Okay. So I mean, it's really a supply, I mean, it's getting to the supply of the core product more than being able to push older. Bill Nash : Well, I think it's just more -- it's a bigger issue. It's just -- you have to go back to a vehicle affordability. It's just keeping a lot of people on the sidelines right now. And it's not only vehicle affordability, that's the lion's share. But you also have rising interest rates. If I look at CAF payments, just Tier-1 payment, just as an example. So the monthly payment, which is the biggest factor on whether someone's going to decide to buy a car or not, it's up 150 bucks year-over-year with the majority of that being driven by the vehicle price, with a smaller piece being driven by the interest rates. And I think you've got that which is obviously keeping people on the sidelines, not to mention just the overall inflationary pressures. And I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we've got the right amount of inventory, the right mix of inventory out there to meet the consumer demand and be very thoughtful about, our margins in order to cover the costs in the way that we're taking people first mindset on how we approach the business. John Murphy : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Just to clarify for this sales environment where comps continuing to trend down 20%, you still expect SG&A to be flat to up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and going forward? Enrique Mayor-Mora: No, I mentioned that you need to back out the $23 million we got last year in the third quarter. And so we would expect to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It gets a little bit tricky Seth is like quarter-to-quarter things can happen. But our expectation is that we would be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Seth Basham : Okay. And again, how much down and when you think about the 20% decline persisting when you decide to get more aggressive on SG&A? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Well, we're not going to provide guidance on how much down in the fourth quarter because again, there's some variability quarter-to-quarter, but what I tell you is our expectation is that it will be down year-over-year. And if you look at the kind of the trend that we've been managing to -- I think we've been focused on SG&A. And we've been pulling the right levers so far. Now, if business doesn't pick up and deteriorates, we have other levers we can pull, right. But for the time being, we believe we pulled the right levers, and we'll continue to manage the business prudently as we always do. Seth Basham : Got it. And my follow up question is just on the wholesale business, the wholesale to retail ratio in terms of units sold, declined sharply to 66% this quarter, would you consider this the new normal? Bill Nash : No, I consider this what you would see in a highly depreciating market. When prices are going down a lot like they have been. And consumers have been told for the last year that this is the best time to sell their car, they can get more than they could ever gotten before. There's a disconnect there. And so as prices come down, it always drives our buy rate down. The other thing I would just add to that is that we stepped back, our appraisal advertising just given the volatility of the market. So no, I don't consider this the new norm. Seth Basham : Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Following up on the SG&A question. I guess is there a way to contextualize how much you've taken out year-to-date of SG&A. And what that run rate is now in the fourth quarter because I'm assuming that those initiatives continued in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think the better way to think about it Sharon, or the best way to think about it is just the cadence, the year-over-year cadence that we've had, because there's always seasonality that occurs right quarter-to-quarter in our business, and that also impacts SG&A. But if you again, if you go back to the first half of the year, Q1, we grew SG&A 19% up year-over-year in the first quarter. In the second quarter, it was up 16% year-over-year. This quarter, if you back out the legal settlement that we got last year, we're down 1%. So that's a significant decrease in the pace of SG&A. And so we are focused on it, we are managing to the current environment. And we think we're doing so appropriately. Now, if the business continues to be challenged, there's other things we can do. But for the time being, we've taken some pretty material steps to manage our SG&A. Sharon Zackfia : Yes. I think part of the confusion is, it sounds as if you're expecting SG&A to be down. Similarly, like down 1% in the fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year, but it also sounds as if you're continuing to proactively manage SG&A. And I think a lot of us are trying to reconcile that in our heads as to why we wouldn't see SG&A down a bit more year-over-year than what you saw in the third quarter, if that makes sense. Enrique Mayor-Mora: We expect to continue to see SG&A kind of to go down. I think coming into individual quarter, it gets a little bit challenging to give you a number that we're managing too, many things can happen on a quarter. But what I tell you is thematically and practically we expect to continue to manage our SG&A down from a year-over-year basis. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Maybe separately? I mean, how should we think about SG&A on a full year basis for next year? So you've got a lot of moving parts, you kind of have to keep your muscle intact for a potential rebound. But at the same time, you're dealing with a very difficult macro climate. So as we think about next year, particularly with the curtailment in the opening, I mean how are you viewing SG&A dollar growth? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. The way we're looking at SG&A is, we've given guidance in the past, like, hey, we need 5% to 8% gross profit go to lever, I think in this kind of environment, right? In this kind of macro backdrop, that kind of guidance is less important than what I'm about to say. So we are actually managing, and our goal is to get to kind of the mid 7%, 8% SG&A to gross profit, right, that is our first step on the way to improving our SG&A. Now we're going to need gross profit growth there, right. But that is our first step. Over time, we have talked about having an operating model that's more efficient than what it used to be. And we still expect that that's going to be over time, though, how many transformations and you can take a look at other retailers that have gone through it, it takes time to get to a better and more efficient operating model. But we expect to get back to where we used to be, it's just going to take time. Our first step is to get to kind of the mid 7%, 8% SG&A to gross profit, right. But again, we're going to need gross profit support to get there. In the meantime, we're going to continue to manage our SG&A appropriately for the market. And that's what we do. And you can see that's exactly what we did in the third quarter. We expect to carry that forward into the fourth quarter and into next year. Bill Nash : And I think Sharon, we will also have a lot more visibility after the fourth quarter to really be able to tell you more depending on how the business does between now and then. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : And I'll try to hit the SG&A topic in a different way. But there's been a change in the competitive landscape. And I think it's been to your favor. And I'm wondering if philosophically, you could make a change in how aggressive you are with respect to SG&A given that, winning in this market may not be a sprint anymore, but might truly be a marathon and allow you to throttle back more aggressively than -- just low single digit percentage cuts. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, Craig. I think it about a little bit differently. I think similar to you, but we have competitors that are, obviously struggling. I don't think now is the time where, given our financial strength where we should be pulling back a whole bunch on SG&A. We have pulled considerably back. But at the same time, as I talked in my opening remarks, we also want to make sure that we're continuing to build for the future. And I think what everybody needs to remember is, we don't operate this business on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we operate the business for the success over the long-term. And there are some things that we're spending on that will absolutely help us longer term. Does it give us a headwind for EPS right now? Absolutely. But is it the right decision for the company long-term? Absolutely. So again, I think, really, my thoughts are on your questions, we're going to continue to walk this fine line. We want to continue to build out the muscle. We want to continue to find near term efficiencies, which we will do. And we'll continue to manage the business with a long-term view versus just a quarter-to-quarter view. Craig Kennison : And maybe just to follow up, I mean, obviously, the stocks under significant pressure, and it feels like you have the long term philosophy, but not enough shareholders are on board with it, is there something you can do to improve the messaging, or the guidance provided to maybe reduce the amount of surprise with which your results are met? Bill Nash : I think the surprise is coming from macro factors to Enrique's point that we really, those are things that you can't control. And so what you need to focus on is what you can control and obviously, I think our long-term messaging is still more intact than ever. Yes, we've got some pain here in the short-term. But guess what we've seen pain before in the short-term. We've seen, if you look at market share, for example, which is a proxy for how I think success is going, if you look at market share, we've historically we've gained market shares. I mean, even in the time we are at 08, 09, we lost a little market share in the near-term, but then we quickly got it back. And then some more. Even if you look in the last few years, when you look back at like FY 20, when we started really rolling out our online capabilities, we saw a step up in market share gains. Unfortunately, we went into COVID, we gave a little bit back, but the following year, we got that back plus more. Now we're in a recessionary period. So again, I think everybody just needs to kind of keep a perspective of what we're going after long term. And yes, the short-term can be a little noisy, but the long-term message is still intact. Craig Kennison : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the credit side for John, if you could give us some incremental color you had mentioned 2 to 2.5 is kind of normal for Tier-1. So what were the equivalent kind of loss ratio expectations be for Tier-2 and Tier-3? And then by way of follow up would be, can you give some incremental color around delinquency trends and roll rates, if possible, at all, by tier would be very helpful? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes. Right on. Thanks for the question. The 2% to 2.5% is, again, our targeted range. I think we've done a great job staying within there. We've been in the Tier-3 business for since 2014, I think we've historically quoted, it's basically, you know, 1% of our receivables initially, it's now 2%. And obviously, substantially higher loss rates, I think we've put it's often 10% of our losses when it was 1%. So you're seeing maybe a 10x, 10-fold loss rate difference there in the Tier-3. Tier-2 is somewhere in between depends on where we choose to play there, there's obviously a wide spectrum. So hopefully, that gives us some color on how to expect losses, provisioning, whatever, around the different buckets, overall macro factors and delinquencies and losses, impacting our portfolio. I think it\u2019s very clear delinquencies are on the rise in the industry, there's no doubt, you can see that within our ABS deals, we've mentioned that historically, there's certainly think pressure in the consumer. I think we've done a really, really strong job at working with that consumer. And while they might go 30, 35 days past due, helping them find solutions, such that it doesn't go into a charge off status. So we continue to fight that good fight and work with our consumers. As Bill mentioned, obviously, monthly payments are up, I think we've done a nice job of being responsible in our lending to our consumers and helping them through it. And ultimately, we reserve accordingly expecting all of this. So I think we're in a good position from a reserve standpoint, we'll watch the credit environment and the consumer very carefully. And hopefully that answers your questions. Michael Montani : And maybe can you just contrast a little bit the current delinquency experience, you're seeing vis-\u00e0-vis, what was happening in 07 and 08? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, I think what you're seeing historically is, I would say, 07 and 08, you absolutely saw an impact across the entire credit spectrum substantially. I think what we've identified is, we're seeing a little more pressure on maybe the lower credit consumer, the Tier-3 into the Tier-2, maybe even a lower side of our Tier-1 space. So I see that definitely different. And again, I think that we're seeing delinquency pressure that that hint of a challenge for the consumer, but it really is not manifesting itself into loss. Again, we're going to watch it carefully. And we'll see what happens. But you absolutely saw more of an impact across the credit spectrum and into the loss side in 08, 09. And again, I think that's a very different environment. We can all agree with that, the labor pressure is back then versus now income for the worker. So we'll see where it translates. But I think those are the fundamental differences we've seen. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : We'll go take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : I want to talk about your path to your target SG&A gross. It sounds like it's gross profit dependent on some level, but some of the gross profit levels like service and use volumes that are out of your control. I think it's probably fair to say the wholesalers took a pretty big step down this quarter. But you've driven significant improvement there. So I guess my point is like, where do you see the gross profit coming from? Is there any reason I think that wholesale could read on evidently. Bill Nash : I think to Enrique's point earlier, it is a two-piece equation. We're controlling the expense side, the gross profit, we're going to need the business to come back. We're going to need it to come back. So, I think wholesale gross profit. Obviously, we made some good improvements there retail. Actually, wholesale and retail GPUs I think are both strong. Now it's about getting some of the volume back. I think, wholesale, I'm hopeful we can grow that a little bit more. Like I said, we did some things this quarter that probably slowed that down a little bit. But I think that's where it's going to be. It'd be dependent that's going to -- that'll carry some weight. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay, Then, question on CAF quickly, the penetration jumped a ton, despite like a pretty large rate hike. And imagine like you've been more in terms of quicker to raise rates. And Bring Your Own Financing jumped a bit, too, as well. And Tier-2 and Tier-3 declined. You're also adding new partners onto the Tier-2, Tier-3 network, if I heard that correctly. So you can talk about you're seeing there an aggregate or the Tier-2 and Tier-3 tightening credit at the margin. Does your new instant appraisal tool that you've added? It sounds like it includes the partners more. Will that help drive penetration of Tier-2, 3. Just any thoughts there would be helpful? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Let me take them sequentially here. So just remark one overall penetration, yes, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, CAF penetration is up -- in tandem with actually us raising rates, I think that's something we're really pleased about. We know that generally, you're going to lag the market. Again, we're competing with credit unions at the higher end. But I think we've done a fantastic job at raising rates 40 basis points sequentially, 150 basis points year-over-year, and still captured that penetration. So we're pleased with that. You see, the Tier-2 penetration down from last year. And that's your three penetration down. I think that's a combination of two things. You absolutely see the consumer challenge there, as Bill mentioned. You still see an affordability issue there. But yes, absolutely. As we mentioned, lenders are being very -- what they need to do to operate independently and pull back where they need to. And I think there's the benefit of our platform, you've got a number of lenders, they're going to work together to figure out what's best for them, but collectively provides a good credit offer in the long run. So I think that's you definitely see pullback there. Chris, last part of your question, I think you mentioned -- not instant appraisal tool, but our pre-quarter tool. Just to clarify there. We mentioned that we're continuing to add lenders on to that tool. Again, we think it's a best-in-class tool, it requires a lot of nimbleness from our lenders, they're all coming on board. Are we seeing engagement there? Yes. I don't know that that's necessarily driving a ton into the penetration story, albeit that tool does bring a better credit quality consumer to the application process. But so does that answer your questions? What else have I missed? Chris Bottiglieri : Nothing. You got my laundry list. And thanks for correcting my misspoken. Yes, that's why that was the insert. Sorry, I said began the financing penetration tool. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead. Chris Pierce : I just wanted to kind of get some color around. You talked about competitors acting aggressively to preference units versus price where you guys\u2019 kind of do the opposite. Is that positive because it means the industry is moving back to normal, but or is it a short-term negative because they're going to have fresher inventory that's going to lower your unit numbers and just kind of want to know how to think about that and how that's kind of trended in the past. You've talked about seeing this before? Bill Nash : Yes, Chris. I think what you're saying is, there's competitors out there that just aren't -- weren't moving any inventory and depreciation has been very steep. And so what they're doing is they're trying to move some of that inventory. We've seen this in the past, in a lot of cases, it's not sustainable over the long-term, because you're just not making the money that you need to, but you're trying to get units moved. It's again, the reason why we did the expensive price. That's we wanted to see what the elasticity. And we did prices both up and down. So we did prices down, we also did price tests up just to kind of better understand it, which again, just gives us confidence that we made the right decision from a profitability standpoint. Chris Pierce : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from David Whiston with Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Whiston : It looks like you had a really great free cash flow generation quarter from an inventory reduction. And I'm just curious, I guess, wanting you, how much longer can you reduce your inventory to get that free cash flow benefit yet still have adequate vehicle inventory to sell? And then, you paid off the revolver with some of that free cash flow? Do you also want to pay off that June 24 term loan to get some more balance sheet health, would you rather have that cash on hand? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think in this kind of environment, I think having some cash on hand isn't a bad thing. And we absolutely used the really effective management of inventory like Bill talked about. We decreased overall inventory year-over-year, but we actually increased our sellable inventory. So that's some impressive work by the teams to work through our WIP. And so that was really good news. We used that cash basically to, as you mentioned, to pay down the revolver, this quarter take it down to zero, that would be of no tap on our revolver. And at the same time, sit on some cash, I just think, David in this kind of environment, it's not a bad thing to have some cash as well. So it gives us ultimately the flexibility to manage through this kind of environment. And, we have a really strong balance sheet. We're proud of it. And we have flexibility that others don't have in the industry. And I think that puts us in a position of strength. David Whiston : And somewhat related, the buyback pause. I do understand wanting to be prudent. But should we interpret this to mean you guys are less optimistic about maybe the short to mid-term than you were three months ago? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Well, it's important that we run a conservative balance sheet in this kind of environment. And as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, we do look at our net leverage ratios in terms of something to manage to carefully to make sure we have ultimate flexibility when it comes to having funds and managing CAF. We do have a very large cap to finance organization. And that's just a key consideration that goes into it. So I think until the business kind of improves, and just as importantly, the macro backdrop improves, I expect that we will pause the share buyback. That being said, we remain fully committed to the share repurchase program, and we'll get back into it at the appropriate time when things improve, and the outlook improves. Bill Nash : Yes, David, that's about our views have changed on, things are going to get worse. It's just more about the uncertainty. David Whiston : Yes, I hear you. Hopefully, it's not too long of a pause. I think your stock is very attractive here. Operator : Thank you. We don't have any further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back over to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Thank you, Ashley. Well, listen, thanks, everyone for joining the call today and for your questions. As I said multiple times today, we believe we're well positioned to navigate this environment and I do think, we will emerge an even stronger company. I want to thank again, our associates for everything they're doing in their commitment to each other and the customer and the communities and the environment. And I want to wish you all a happy holiday season and we look forward to talking again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The current challenges in the used auto industry are well documented, with affordability pressured by broad inflation, climbing interest rates, tightening lending standards and prolonged low consumer confidence. We are continuing to leverage our strongest assets, our associates, our experience in our culture to build momentum and manage through this cycle. While there are many macro factors that we cannot control, we have taken deliberate steps to support our business both the near-term and the long run. This quarter, we reduced SG&A further. We delivered strong retail GPU through our vehicle acquisition, reconditioning and margin management strategies, while continuing to test price elasticity. We adjusted offers to deliver strong wholesale GPU, while increasing unit sales quarter-over-quarter. We aligned used saleable inventory units with market conditions, while driving down total inventory dollars more than 25% year-over-year. And finally, we raised CAF's consumer rates to help offset rising cost of funds while still growing CAF\u2019s penetration. We are prioritizing initiatives to drive efficiency and improve experiences for our associates and customers. We believe these steps will enable us to come out of this cycle leaner and more effective, while also positioning us for future growth. Reflecting on fiscal \u201823, we achieved a number of key milestones in each area of our diversified business model. We enabled online self-progression for all of our retail customers; enhanced our wholesale shopping experience; and completed the nationwide rollout of our finance-based shopping prequalification product. All of these accomplishments further position our business for growth as the most customer centric experience in the industry. I'll talk more about these later in the call. And now into our results for the fourth quarter of FY \u201823. Our diversified business model delivered total sales of $5.7 billion, down 26%, compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 12.6% and used unit comps were down 14.1%. Average selling prices declined approximately $2,700 per unit or 9% year-over-year. In addition to the macro factors I mentioned previously, we believed our performance continued to be impacted by transitory competitive responses to the current environment. Our market share data indicated that our nationwide share of zero to 10-year old vehicles remained at 4% for calendar year 2022. External title data shows that the market share gains we achieved during the first-half of the year were offset by share losses during the second-half of the year as we prioritize profitability over near-term market share. For context, we have lost the market share during prior down cycles. In those cases, we recovered the market share and then continued to grow up to new heights as economic conditions improved. We remain focused on achieving profitable market share gains that can be sustained for the long-term and plan to continue running extensive price elasticity tests. The results from our most recent test confirmed that holding margins during the quarter was the right profitability play. Despite the decrease in average selling price, fourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,277, up $82 per unit year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to appropriately value vehicles and effectively manage margin in inventory. Wholesale unit sales were down 19.3% versus the fourth quarter last year, but improved from the 36.7% decline during this year's third quarter as our total boughts\u2019 from consumers and dealers improved sequentially. Wholesale average selling price declined approximately $3,200 per unit or 28% year-over-year, that we saw some appreciation beginning in January. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $11.87, which is consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Margin benefited from the recent price appreciation I just mentioned and from strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of the quarter. We bought approximately 262,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, down 22% from last year's record, but a sequential improvement from the 40% decline during this year's third quarter. Our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We purchased approximately 247,000 cars from consumers in the quarter with a little more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience. We sourced approximately 15,000 vehicles through dealers, up 4% from last year. In regard to our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 11% in the prior year, approximately 52% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, down from 55% in the prior year. Nearly all of our fourth quarter wholesale auctions in sales which represents 18% of total revenue remain virtual and are considered online transactions. We began a small wholesale auction simulcast test during the quarter to gauge dealer interest in resuming in-person attendance and will continue to test options for live attendance during FY \u201824. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%, down slightly from last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $124 million, down from $194 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contribution in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on managing what is in our control drove a sequential improvement from the third quarter across key financial metrics, including EPS, gross profit and SG&A. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.44, down from $0.98 a year ago. Total gross profit was $611 million, down 14% from last year's fourth quarter. Used retail margin of $387 million and wholesale vehicle margin of $143 million declined 9% and 20% respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across used and wholesale. This was partially offset by strong margin per unit performance. Used unit margins increased from last year's fourth quarter and wholesale margins per unit were flat year-over-year. Other gross profit was $81 million, down 24% from last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by a decline in extended protection plan or EPP revenues. In addition to the impact of lower retail unit sales, profit sharing revenues from our partners decreased from $33 million in last year's fourth quarter to $16 million in this year's quarter. This was partially offset by stronger margins and a favorable year-over-year return reserve adjustment. Penetration was flat year-over-year at approximately 60%. Third-party finance fees were relatively flat over last year's fourth quarter with lower volume and fee generating Tier 2 offset by lower Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee. Service was also relatively flat over last year's fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement in year-over-year performance. We have maintained our technician staffing levels and have put in place key efficiency and cost coverage goals for our teams. This supports our expectation of improved performance in FY \u201824, compared to the full FY \u201823 year. The extent to this improvement will also be governed by sales performance given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. On the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter were $573 million, down 8% from the prior year's quarter and down 3% sequentially from this year's third quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was higher than the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to the 14% decrease in total gross profit dollars, compared to last year's quarter. The change in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following factors : first, we reduced advertising by $34 million. Second, total compensation and benefits decreased $17 million, which included an $18 million increase in share based compensation. Excluding the latter, compensation and benefits was down $35 million of which $18 million was due to a lower corporate bonus accrual in the quarter. Third, other overhead increased by $6 million. The year-over-year increase in investments in our technology platforms and strategic growth initiatives was primarily the result of decisions made in prior quarters. This was partially offset by a favorable year-over-year comparison due to costs incurred in last year's fourth quarter associated with a significant ramp in staffing and favorability in a variety of other smaller cost this year. During the quarter, we continue to take steps to better align our expenses to our sales. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs, limiting hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices and continuing to align our marketing spend to sales. While our advertising expense on the dollar and per unit basis was lower year-over-year on the quarter, our investment for the quarter and full-year on a per unit basis remains aligned with last year's full-year spend level. For fiscal \u201824, in total, we anticipate maintaining per unit spend at a similar level to FY \u201823 with per unit spend varying from quarter-to-quarter. We believe that at this point, we largely have the resources in place to meet our near-term omnichannel and other digital investment needs. Accordingly, our expectation is that we will bend the expense growth curve on our omnichannel investments and our overall SG&A. In FY \u201824, we expect to require low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A, well below the levels we've guided to during the investment heavy phases of our omni transformation. As a result, we expect to deliver stronger flow through of gross profit growth to profitability. While we expect that the front half of the year will benefit from the cost management actions we took in the back half of FY \u201823, the magnitude of the year-over-year benefit relative to the 8% decrease we experienced in Q4 may be muted, particularly in Q1. This dynamic stems from rolling over a more comparable period for advertising and a corporate bonus accrual in Q1 than the fourth quarter declines that I noted earlier. While not providing specific guidance beyond FY \u201824, we expect that this bending of the SG&A growth curve will carry over beyond this year. This will support our pathway back to a lower SG&A leverage ratio with the initial goal of returning to the mid-70% range over time. Hitting this range will also require healthier consumer demand. Regarding capital structure, our first priority remains to fund the business. Given the recent performance and ongoing market uncertainty, we continue to take a conservative approach to our capital structure. While our adjusted net debt to capital ratio was slightly below our 35% to 45% targeted range, we are managing our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. In keeping with the school of maintaining flexibility, we continue to pause our share buybacks. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place as does our commitment to return capital to shareholders over time. For capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $450 million in FY \u201824, similar to our FY \u201823 level. This spend is primarily being driven by investments in land and the build out of facilities related to long-term growth capacity for production and options. New store development is also contributing to CapEx, albeit at a lower level as we have slowed the pace of openings in FY \u201824. In FY \u201824, we plan to open five new locations including two more stores in the New York City metro market, as well as our first off-site production location in the Atlanta metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continues to be a competitive advantage for CarMax. Our liquidity remains very strong and we ended the quarter with approximately $350 million in cash on the balance sheet and no draw on our $2 billion revolver. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the fourth quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $1.9 billion, resulting in penetration of 44.7% net of three-day payoffs, up from the 41% seen in the same quarter last year and in line with Q3. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers at 10.9% was up 110 basis points from Q3 and 270 basis points from the same period last year. We were pleased with our ability to increase consumer rates within the quarter, while maintaining a consistent share of finance contracts sequentially and growing our share of finance contracts substantially on a year-over-year basis. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 19.4% lower than typical seasonal levels. Tier 3 penetration was flat to last year at 6.9%, while our long-term lending partners continued to complement each other in providing strong credit offers to our customers, we did observe year-over-year tightening as both rising interest rates and delinquencies likely led to these adjustments. Of note, CAF has also adjusted its underwriting standards in reaction to the current environment, including towards the end of Q4 reducing its targeted percentage of Tier 3 volume from 10% to 5%. CAF income for the quarter was $124 million, down from $194 million in the same period last year. The $70 million year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a $44 million increase in loan loss provision, as well as a $61 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by growth in interest and fee income. Within the quarter, total interest margin decreased to $262 million, down $22 million from the same quarter last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.3% is down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year and 125 basis points from the near 10-year peak seen in this year's first quarter, driven mostly by the significant interest rate jumps absorbed during the past year. In response, we have made numerous pricing moves over the last 12 months, including in the fourth quarter that should cause the reduction in margin to slow and allow this portfolio rate to level off in fiscal year 2024. The loan loss provision in Q4 of $98 million results in an ending reserve balance of $507 million or 3.02% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $491 million last quarter, which was 2.95% of receivables. This sequential 7 basis point adjustment in the reserved to receivable ratio reflects unfavorable performance within the portfolio, as well as the uncertain macro environment along with the continued increase in cash Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume. We continue to target and operate within the 2% to 2.5% cumulative net credit loss range for our core Tier 1 portfolio and we believe we are appropriately reserved for future losses. Regarding further advancements in our credit technology, we continue to stabilize and improve upon our nationally available best-in-class pre-qualification product, finance-based shopping or FBS. During the fourth quarter, we fully deployed yet another of our large lending partners within the FBS platform, now bringing the total to five of well-established lenders that are providing decisions on the full vehicle inventory for an applicant and co-applicant, leveraging a soft credit pull. Note what truly makes this product distinct in used auto industry is our ability to calculate over 6 million unique credit decisions every minute from multiple finance sources, each leveraging their own distinct credit models and then to make these offers digitally available to customers wherever they are shopping in the store, at home, we're walking the lot. During this upcoming first quarter, we hope to add additional finance partners to the platform as work is already well underway. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of the call, even as we navigated the challenges of fiscal \u201823, we achieved a number of key milestones during the year by focusing on making our omnichannel experience faster, simpler and more seamless for our associates and customers. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer synthetic experience in the industry. Some highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact across our diversified business model are for retail we enabled online self-progression capabilities for all of our customers. As we evolve our omnichannel experience, we're also updating our operating models to drive efficiency gains in our stores. During the year, we launched self-checking capabilities for appraisal customers and also enhanced e-sign functionality to better enable self-progression. Our e-commerce engine combined with our unparalleled nationwide fiscal footprint is a competitive advantage. Our ability to deliver integration across digital and physical transactions is a key differentiator in both the experience we provide in the total addressable market available to us. For wholesale, we rolled out a modernized mobile friendly vehicle details page that displays the most relevant information from dealers they need to preview our wholesale inventory, creating a shopping experience for dealers that is similar to how consumers shop our retail inventory. We also expanded MaxOffer, our digital appraisal product for dealers to approximately 50 markets, which enable us to build on our leading position as a buyer of cars. We utilize our admin sales team to sign up new dealers for the service, which provides profitable incremental wholesale volume. For credit in CAFs, we completed the nationwide rollout of finance-based shopping, our multi-lender prequalification product. As Jon mentioned, this gives customers the flexibility to digitally receive quick credit decisions from a majority of our lenders across the entire vehicle inventory. Over 80% of our customers have used this online tool as they begin the credit process. In addition CAF is equally focused on coming out of this cycle leaner and more effective. The team is already leveraging the new loan receivable system that we deployed a little over a year ago to deliver on savings opportunities with many more expected in the upcoming years. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201824, we will build on last year's initiatives and prioritize projects that unlock operating efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and customers. We are confident that the actions we will take position us better to capture the upside when the market improves. Some examples include : for retail, we are leveraging data science, automation and AI to make it even easier for customers to complete key transaction steps on their own and to go back and forth between assisted health and self-progression. We are also building digital tools that will support customers across key transaction steps and their journey and give them better insight into their remaining steps. These tools will drive online sales and make it easier for customers to opt in to express pickup. This delivery option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in as little as 30 minutes and represents a win-win opportunity. Our research shows that customers love this experience when utilized and it will enable us to lower cost over time. For wholesale, we will leverage our modernized vehicle detail page to offer new services. Some examples include AI enhanced conditional reports, and proxy bidding capabilities. We will also improve MaxOffer by rolling out our instant offer experience to all participating dealers. These tools will enable us to drive incremental operational efficiencies as we continue to scale our wholesale volume, all while providing a better experience. For CAF, we're working to integrate our finance-based shopping product into our stores and customer experience centers more seamlessly, so that all consumers can enjoy the full experience. As Jon mentioned, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to add additional lenders to the platform, which will expand the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers. While these are a few good examples, our entire organization from Edmonds to Logistics is focused on improving efficiencies and experiences. We are confident in the future of our diversified business. We will continue to evaluate our performance relative to our long-term financial targets annually. As we start fiscal \u201824, we are affirming the targets that we updated in April \u201822, selling between 2 million and 2.4 million vehicles through our combined retail and wholesale channels by fiscal \u201826 generating between $33 billion and $45 billion in revenue by fiscal \u201926, and growing our nationwide market share of zero to 10-year old vehicles to more than 5% by the end of calendar \u201825. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work they do. They are our strongest differentiator and the key to our success. Last week, Fortune Magazine named CarMax is one of its 100 Best Companies to Work for, for the 19th year in a row. I am incredibly proud of this recognition, particularly as we faced a challenging year. It's due to our associates' commitments in supporting each other, our customers and our communities every day. Over our nearly 30-year history, we've navigated many challenging environments and have emerged stronger each time. This environment is no different and I'm confident that the actions we are taking will enable us to drive robust growth as the market improves. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Corless? Operator : Absolutely. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Guys, wanted to talk just a little bit about the CAF business to start off. Enrique, just hoping maybe you could hit us with kind of maybe your thoughts on where maybe some of the key metrics might look out maybe, say, the next quarter or so? Maybe on kind of losses as well as recoveries and maybe the crosscurrents there? But also just kind of on your cost of funds and where that's kind of moving to of late, as well as kind of the coupon rate that's going to the consumer? And is there a lag? Is there a catch-up period? Just how we can think about maybe some of those dynamics moving for -- as we start fiscal \u201824? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I'll address the cost of funds and kind of how to think about that. Then I'll turn it over to Jon to talk about the business. So from a cost of funds perspective, what I'd tell you is that the securitization market, which we're largely dependent on, the market is open, is constructive currently and what we've seen, you signed in our first deal where the cost of funds came down relative to the deal that ended in 2022, right? And so we do believe that, that the benchmarks continue to come down, spreads continue to be healthy and we would expect that to, kind of, carry forward. Per timing, you would expect us to be in the market here in the near-term. But we would expect to be able to execute our deal. And again, I think relative to a couple of deals ago where the market really was compressed and the cost of funds was one of the highest we had seen in many, many, many years, it's come down from there. Still higher than obviously what we'd like them to be, but certainly better than where they had trended a couple of deals ago. Jon Daniels : Sure. And I'll jump in on the other metrics. Just to piggyback on the cost of funds, obviously the other component there is the kind of APR, that's in the deal as well. Last time, we were at 9.09%, we just cited that we were 10.9% on our originations in this quarter, we've done a great job of raising rates through the year. So you can imagine that to drive through into future deals as well. So if spread settles in and our APRs are higher, that should benefit us. With regard to losses and delinquencies, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, again, we've taken our reserve up to $507 million, that's 3.02% of receivables. Did mention that some of that is driven by unfavorability in the portfolio and the macro environment. I think the entire industry is feeling a higher sense of delinquency in the consumer for us in the existing book of business. You've got some -- you've got definitely higher inflation making it more challenging for consumers. Our newer originations are purchasing at a higher average selling price, therefore, there's a higher payment. So people are having to work through having a higher auto payment than they might normally be used to. So all of these factors or things we're watching very carefully. We've reserved accordingly for it, but definitely a rise in delinquencies that we've done a nice job with and hasn't fully trended its way into losses and we think we're going to be able to continue to serve the consumer well. The other thing I'll add to that is we did mention in the prepared remarks and we have tightened -- many lenders have tightened on their -- in our platform, as well as outside of the industry and we've tightened as well. But something that we've done on a regular basis, we did it in the great recession, we did it at the start of a pandemic. We've done it many times in between. So we have tightened just to make it a little more conservative to watch this consumer carefully. But again, with our tightening, our partners will be happy to pick up that volume as we've done. So looking out hard to say where losses and delinquencies are going to be, but we think we're in that 2% to 2.5% range as we always have. We think we're well reserved and we'll watch the consumer carefully. John Healy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on retail and wholesale GPUs. Those were both, I think, stronger than we were anticipating. If you could just provide some update on the pricing volatility that we're seeing pretty unprecedented, I think both at retail as well as at wholesale. And then competitively what you're seeing in the market, how sustainable is this, kind of, strong discipline in GPU I guess for those two segments? Bill Nash : Sure. Good morning, Michael. Yes, on the retail and wholesale GPU, obviously, they did come in stronger. I think the wholesale benefited a little bit we saw some appreciation in the latter part of the quarter, which when that generally happens, we usually trail whether it goes up or comes down. So I think that added a little bit of favorability there. I think as you go forward thinking about wholesale, I would land probably more in the line of where we've been historically $900 to $1,000. On the retail side again, we did expansive price elasticity testing and determined that we could have sold a few more cars, but we actually would have made less money. So we held the retail GPUs, they're pretty similar to the third quarter. They were up year-over-year and that's more of a function of the fact that we continue to have a higher mix of older vehicles, which carry a little bit more margin. I think just in the retail pricing environment in totality, we did see some depreciation at the beginning of the quarter, we saw a little bit of appreciation at the latter part. If you go back a year ago, not this year, they just completed the year before, prices appreciated about $7,500 and that's in the zero to five-year old cars this year. By the end of the calendar year, they had come back about $5,000, I would expect, even though we've seen some recent appreciation, I would expect to probably start to see a little bit more depreciation as we go forward. So that should continue to give a little bit of relief on the overall retail sales price. Michael Montani : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. We're hearing that some banks [Technical Difficulty] Bill Nash : Corless, I think we may have lost Craig. Operator : Craig, your line is open. Craig Kennison : Yes, good morning. Can you hear me? Bill Nash : Yes, we can hear you, Craig. Go ahead. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Yes, so we've heard that some banks are pulling back on floor plan credit for some of your competitors. I'm wondering since you self-fund your inventory, would you expect an advantage sourcing inventory in this environment? Bill Nash : Yes. I think it's hard to say, I mean, what I would tell you is because our self-sufficiency is so high, we just really haven't had an issue on sourcing environment. It's not like we're going out and competing in the auction lanes as much as we used to. I think it remains to be seeing what the impact is on competitors and where they get their funding. I guess theoretically, it could cause prices to go down if they are not able to source financing to keep inventory on the lot. But that remains to be seen. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just had like a question on SG&A and one within that. Maybe just on the store occupancy car, it was lower quarter-over-quarter by roughly 10%, despite five new stores opened. Is there something we're missing there? We would have expected it to be up sequentially given the new openings, but I just want to make sure, are we not missing any one-timers there? And then I have a quick follow-up. Jon Daniels : Great. Yes, thanks, Rajat. Yes, I don't think we\u2019re missing anything, I thing a couple of points here. One is that there was some timing of spend from quarter-to-quarter things will vary. So we had some timing favorability this quarter over the previous quarter. In addition, given the volumes and where they're at, we had a bit of a pullback in our rent as volumes flex, we will move up in terms of our off lot short-term capacity to accommodate volumes. And given where volumes are at, we did have a pullback in our off-site capacity. So you'll see that reflected in occupancy through a lower rent. So those are the two bigger items I'd tell you within the quarter. Rajat Gupta : Understood. That's helpful. And in terms of just budgeting purposes for SG&A for the year. What kind of view are you taking on the used car market this year? Do you expect the industry, especially the zero to 10-year old space to grow this year and do you expect to grow share within that -- with the level of ad spend that you're guiding to? Just curious like what kind of shape of recovery are you assuming in your budgeting plan? Bill Nash : Yes, Rajat, thanks for the question. Look, we're certainly not economists, but I think there's some publications and I think like COGS for example has the used market overall being down a little bit this year. I think you also have it softer in the front part, I mean, softer in the front part a little bit better in the back half. I think that's kind of the way we think about it as well, but that remains to be seen. And as always on the market share, our goal is whether the market is a good market or a bad market. We want to gain profitable market share and I spoke to just the transitory pressures that we continue to see in this quarter as it relates to market share. But given previous experiences, we would expect that to turn and then we'd get back into gaining market share. Rajat Gupta : Understood. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Brian Nagel : So a question I want to ask. So kind of comments, it sounds like you are telegraphing for this year now a lower leverage point. I mean, you're going to leverage expenses at lower rates of growth. So I guess the question I have is to make sure I'm correct in that assessment. And then what changed? I mean, what were you -- what levers were you able to pull in order to allow them to happen? And then, again, kind of going back to your comments for clarification, should we assume that as the business eventually strengthens out of this cyclical trough that leverage point will remain more skewed than it had been previously? Bill Nash : Yes, everyone. Thanks for the question. I'll give you my thoughts first and I'm sure Enrique will have some thoughts as well. But you're exactly right, we are -- send in the message that we expect this to be at a lower rate going forward. And if you think about the past few years, every year we update and say, okay, this is what it's going to take to lever and we're running that five day in this past year, prior year we said, hey, it's going require more than that, because of the investments we knew we were making plus some of the carryover investments. We hadn't been giving longer term guidance, because quite honestly, while many companies have gone from a pure brick and mortar to more of an omnichannel, there really hasn't been any other example of companies doing that with what I call considered purchase where there's a lot of back and forth between physical and digital properties. And so I almost equate this to renovating an old house, which unfortunately haven't experienced with that too. You don't know what you don't know until you get into it. And every time you pull down a wall in old house there's some new surprise there. Well, with this, every time we would turnover a rock as it related to the omnichannel experience, there were two other rocks underneath it. And I think what we've gotten to the point of is that we've built out our product organization. We feel really good about the resources there. We've got the base of the capabilities. Now it's about enhancing, and then as we enhance and finish some things, we'll shift people to work on different things. So we feel good about the resources that we have at this point. And I'll let Enrique add any other\u2026 Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, just to build on that a little bit, [Steve] (ph), as I said in my prepared remarks, we are past the investment in heavy phase for omni transformation. We believe, largely speaking that we have the resources in place, we're appropriately staffed and now it's really a matter of executing on our plans to really focus around enhancing efficiencies, enhancing and strengthening experiences for our customers and for our associates, right? But we believe we passed that point. So we do think that now and for the guidance that we've given, low-single-digit gross profit growth is what we're going to need to lever. And I would think about that as well as carrying beyond FY \u201824 and into, while not giving specific guidance, I would think about that. That is kind of where we are in our maturity curve as a company and that's kind of how I think about it for the next period of time. Brian Nagel : Alright, guys. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. A few things around SG&A. Just want to make sure I understand the context around leverage. So are you referring to SG&A leverage as a percent of sales or SG&A to gross profit? So just want to make sure, well, level set on what metric you're using. I also want to clarify the cadence in the first quarter, are you referring to sequential moderation in the decline or year-over-year moderation? I think that's, kind of, important to quantify as well? And then lastly and I'm sorry it's a multipronged question. It's just on the ad spend, so it\u2019s a little surprised to hear and I think I heard correctly that ad spend per car would remain consistent year-over-year. And I just wondered the thought process behind that given the environment we're in, which it sounds as if a lot of people are just priced out of cars' period. So I wonder about keeping that ad spend, kind of, at the same level versus retracting maybe more towards the $300 level that you had historically? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Thank you, Sharon, for the multiple questions. And see here if I can\u2026 Sharon Zackfia : Couple of clarifications, I'm using the clarifications [Multiple Speaker] Enrique Mayor-Mora: I guess the others, and you asked different here, right? So on the first one, absolutely, we moved to leverage being defined as SG&A to gross profit. So not retail units, not sales because as you know, as we've migrated and transformed ourselves it's also about just solely per retail unit. There's also a better wholesale business, a better CAF business. So we take a holistic look and our leverage point specifically is on gross profit. So I think that was your first point of clarification. The second for the first quarter, yes, it is an important point and I had it in my notes here that I spoke to. So in the fourth quarter, right, we -- year-over-year, we were down 8% in SG&A. So, what we're communicating here is that in the first quarter of FY \u201824 upcoming year that decrease may be muted, compared year-over-year decrease in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter would be muted compared to that 8%. And that's just because we'll be -- will have more comparables when it comes to the corporate bonus accrual, which in the fourth quarter was down pretty materially as I call that in my notes. As well, our fourth quarter last year, our marketing spend was much higher than what it was in this fourth quarter, which provided some relief in this fourth quarter. So that presents a little bit of more of a challenge for the first quarter of FY \u201924, as compared year-over-year, as compared to FY \u201823. And then lastly, on marketing per spend, we made a decision a few years ago to take our marketing per unit spend up along with our journey here and our transformation and that's where we currently what we intend on keeping it. We believe we have a strong line of sight into ROI and very accretive properties and investments here. Our marketing team does a fantastic job and being able to track what is accretive. What is ROI generating and what is not ROI generating. So we have a pretty good understanding of our portfolio of investments when it comes to marketing and currently, we think that 350 roughly per unit spend is appropriate for where we are. Bill Nash : And Sharon, the only other thing I would add to that is, and Enrique said this in his comments, it can vary quarter-to-quarter. You may be up in some quarters, you may be down in some other quarters and that will really be dictated by some of the ROI that we're seeing. We're always going to have some brand spend out there, because I think it's important long-term. So the other thing I think of note here is that when we think about advertising, we also -- it's not just about customer acquisition, it\u2019s also about vehicle acquisition. So there may be sometimes we spend up a little bit more in trying to buy cars from consumer. So again, we'll continue to monitor this. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Obviously, retail prices are still up quite a bit. Average rates also up and so monthly payments are up meaningfully? I know it's causing a double-digit decline in comps, but I guess what kind of impact is it having specifically on your conversion rate? In other words, like when we look at the sales decline, is it being driven more by reduction in traffic or kind of the first swing at the plate that you guys get? Or is it more kind of people get close to finish line and then just decide that they really can't afford what they're looking at? Like is it one more than the other or are they -- those factors about the same? Bill Nash : Yes, great question, Scot, and welcome back to the call. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Bill Nash : It's -- we see the traffic top of funnel, so it's not top of funnel. The degradation really happens at the conversion point and which can make sense as you find a car that you like, you start working through and all of a sudden you realize, wow, that monthly payment is more than I can afford and then you see where they fall out, which is the reason why we've been talking about vehicle affordability is one of the biggest factors that impact our sales. So it's all about conversion, not necessarily top of funnel. Jon Daniels : Yes. And I'll just add on to that, Scot. Just one ahead of thing, what we mentioned the FBS platform and one of the things we're so excited about that, right? So many people are shopping for that monthly payment online out the gate, not in the store necessarily. And so being able to -- if they pick vehicle X and it ends up being a higher payment for them, we're providing them the capability to see payments on all the vehicles with multiple lenders so they can pivot relatively quickly. So we think again once the shock of the higher ASPs come down over time just having that tool out there to adjust that price when in that payment as needed will really benefit us. And we'll springboard out of this thing. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. So total demand is still there. It's just the affordability or the ability to close is really the main challenge if you will? Bill Nash : Yes, the interest is definitely there. And I think some of the web traffic continued strength in the web traffic is also because of the finance based shopping product that Jon just talk to people just trying to figure out what can I afford? Maybe they're not ready to buy a car, but maybe they're just looking to see what can I afford? Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Nash : Good morning. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Enrique, I want to ask on SG&A maybe a little bit different way. You talked about attrition for a few quarters now and you're making -- it seems like good progress driving down that compensation line? Where are staffing levels today in the stores or CECs versus a year ago or before these attrition? Are we 15% lower? Is headcount 20% lower? And then where should that go as growth improves? Because on one hand, I think Bill just mentioned you should stay more lean going forward, but I thought in your prepared remarks you said working toward the mid-70s SG&A to gross ratio over time? So just trying to put those pieces together, if you could talk about kind of the staffing where we're at and where that goes and what it means for long-term SG&A margins? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I'm going to tell you is that we believe we're largely speaking appropriately staffed. There's still some pockets where there's probably some overstaffing that we're working through, right? And, we do it in a healthy way, which is just through attrition. And that's the approach we've taken for the past period here. But largely speaking, we think we're appropriately staffed, kind of, across the board. Compared to last year, right? We were down when it comes to like what flows through SG&A, because we do have a large service department and service associates that flows to our COGS. But just through SG&A, we're down about 10% year-over-year, right? And that's really, kind of, staffing in our CECs as we've rightsized in our stores as we've rightsized as well and that's where you'll see it offset a little bit by our corporate overhead staffing, but net-net we're down about 10%. So that's kind of where we are. When it comes to like the 70% mid-70%. Yes, we're actually striving to get there. Our goal is to get back to a leverage rate that's more reflective of a stronger flow through and a business model that we're striving to get to. Now to get to that number, we're also going to need some help in sales, right, as well to support that. And we expect to get there over time. I think to get there in FY \u201824, I would tell you it would be a strong stretch just, kind of, given where we ended FY \u201823 and kind of where volumes are at. And just the environment that we're operating in. But we are controlling what is in our control and I think we've done a pretty effective job here of taking our SG&A down and thinking about our business model and the maturity curve in terms of where we are with our omni transformation. And now it's really a matter of, kind of, reallocating resources internally to work on the most accretive projects that we have. Bill Nash : Yes. And Daniel, the only other thing I would add to that is even as we -- as business returns, we're heavily focused on finding efficiencies. The business model has really changed within the store with omni. So we're looking at more efficiencies in the CEC, so as more volume comes in, CECs don't have to grow as fast. We've already taken -- we've reduced the sales force, because of the CECs, because customers are coming more progress, which is another reason why we're really focused on this self-progression, the more customers can progress on their own, our floor sales consultants can handle more associates. So as we think about the future model, we're trying to get efficiencies not only at the corporate side, which we feel pretty good about the teams we've got there, but also just become more efficient in the field operations. Daniel Imbro : And if I could squeeze a clarifier, not another question. I guess you guys used to be in the mid to high-60s, it sounds like you reduced headcount 10% the CEC is making more efficient. I guess why wouldn't that or something better than that be the target you're working towards Enrique rather than the mid-70s. I guess have there been incremental expenses from the omni and admins that have just have raised that long-term SG&A margin? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. And what I said is that our first step, right, so our initial goal is to the mid-70s and then longer term, we do have as part of our aspirations to get back to roughly where we were. I don't know if we'll get back fully to where we were in the medium term here, but certainly our first step is to get to the mid-70s. Bill Nash : Yes. And I think Daniel on that, keep in mind part of the omni transformation is we've gone from an organization that worked with all legacy systems that really didn't cost us anything to a combination of systems that we built in-house, but also software-as-a-service. And software-as-a-service is an expense that we used to not have. So things like software-as-a-service, the product organization that we built out, we've got 60 product teams that really enable having this omni channel experience both to have the store and the digital. So that expense isn't going away. We didn't use to have that expense. Theoretically, the CECs will be offset with the sale. So that should watch, but there are the things like cybersecurity that because we have so much of a digital presence now you had to step up your spend there. So there are some things which is why to Enrique\u2019s point, our first goal is, hey, let's get back to the 70s because we know we've got some headwinds on things that we didn't use to have and then we'll continue to work on taking it below there. Daniel Imbro : Great. Appreciate all the color and best of luck. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on retail GPU, pretty good performance this quarter. Curious to know whether or not you think the market dynamics helped you on that metric? And then looking forward, should we be thinking about that flat year-over-year for 2024 fiscal or should there be a movement one way or the other based on the price elasticity expectations and other factors? Bill Nash : Yes. Good morning, Seth. Yes, I think the market dynamics did help, because again, we were doing pricing elasticity tests and as I said earlier, we could have sold some more cars, but overall profitability would have been down. So I think that, that did help. Now as far as going forward, I think, I'd probably get more in the range of where we historically. I think, you know, part of it will depend on what the macro factors, because we'll continue to test elasticity. But if you think about we've been, kind of, in the 2,100 to -- roughly 2,100, 2,150 22,000 in that range. I would think somewhere in that range is probably a good target to think about for the upcoming year. But again, it's going to be dependent on what we see from the market factors. Seth Basham : Okay. And just as a follow-up thinking about the trade-off between unit sales and GPU market share is clearly an important goal of yours. Is there a point in time where you'll be more aggressive on price to regain market share to meet your long-term targets. You truly believe this is transitory? Is there any reason why it may not be? Bill Nash : Yes. No, it's a great question. And again, we've always said this idea of proper market share and that hasn't changed. You know, if I look at the market share for 2022 relatively flat. You can argue it was slightly up, but we call it relatively flat. For the first-half of the year, we saw good market share gains. In fact, most several of the months were double-digit gains. We hit August, August, I would call was fairly flat, and then we saw declining gains really from September through December. And we've seen this before, if I go back to \u201908, \u201909, if I go back to COVID, although they're very different circumstances, we've seen where we've lost market share for a period of time, then it flattens out. We start from a month-over-month, we start to grow it back. We get back to where we were before we started and then we continue to increase. I would expect this to not be any different. I'm encouraged as I look at the data that we have so far, if you look at August through or really September through December, it was decreasing market shares month-over-month. I think December, January, my hope is we've kind of bottomed out there. We don't have the February data yet, but I'm hoping that we bottomed out, which means that, okay, market share should from month-over-month will still be probably below year-over-year, but we should start to climb back out. Seth Basham : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. It's Chris Bottiglieri. I just wanted to ask on CapEx, can you elaborate a little bit more there. The omnichannel is slowing a bit and you're only opening five stores. Just trying to get a sense for like why the CapEx is stepping up? Are you planning to reaccelerate store growth in FY \u201925, this incurring some upfront capital costs there? And then you mentioned -- sorry, there's a long way to question, you said a lot on the call. You mentioned that you're opening up these off-site recognition centers and auction centers. Are these more capital intensive in your stores trying to understand what strategies and what these investments help to accomplish? And just can you elaborate that will be really helpful? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, so year-over-year in FY \u201824, we expect our CapEx spend to be roughly the same as what it was, but what's making it up is changing a little bit, right? And so by far, the largest contributor to our CapEx in FY \u201824 is going to be really that's starting to build out our off-site production, our off-site auction capabilities to ensure that over time, over the longer term that we're able to meet our long targets, right? We feel good about our near-term and our ability to hit kind of our sales, our auction levels, but we also need to plan for the future at the same time. So that consists of buying land across the country. It also consists of this year building out and opening our first off-site production auction -- production site sorry which will be in Atlanta and the metro market there. And the way to think about that is the size of it will be roughly and this way to think about them moving forward in our off-site production locations will be roughly the size of our largest production locations that we have in our stores currently, right? Large acreage, so 20 plus acres as well is how to think about them. And from a CapEx spend, they'll be similar to the CapEx that we had spent in the past on, kind of, our production locations just for those. But that is actually driving the largest piece of our CapEx spend. There is some anticipation that stores will continue to grow in FY \u201925, right? Still, it was going to kind of see how the market, how we perform, how the macro environment is. We have lowered that amount for FY \u201924 as you know, we're at five new stores and we'll see in FY \u201825, but there is some planning for that, that goes ahead even this early on in the year, because it does take quite a bit of time to get a store open. Bill Nash : Yes. And Chris, I would just add to that the planned spend for the capacity, it's no different than what we've done in the past. We used to build production stores as we're going into new markets. Well, what we've been doing here lately, because we haven't opened up a bunch of production stores, we've been leveraging the existing production. So we had planned to add capacity. So it's really no different than what we've done in the past. It just happens to be okay now is time that we start to do some additional production builds. And the really only difference is that some of them will not be attached to stores, but still in close proximity to stores, because that's a big competitive advantage. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. That's really helpful. And then just related, I think you mentioned something effective opening up simulcast to get on wholesale. Can you maybe just elaborate there? It seems you're getting really strong wholesale volumes in GPUs to understand like the motivation there and what that means for revenue and cost? Just any thoughts would be helpful. Bill Nash : Yes. No, it's a good question. We just want to make sure that we're both maximizing the experience for our dealers, as well as maximizing the ultimate price that our cars sell for. And so we're just doing small tests just to see, hey, having a -- both a physical sale, but also virtually broadcasting it, are there new dealers that might show up? Or do you get extra bid. So we -- in our efforts to make sure we're being efficient as possible, we don't want to leave any [Indiscernible] unturned. So I don't really think about it as a big SG&A spend, because a lot of -- like the testing that we're doing is what I would call more of a post card sale. So you actually have the cars running through, but you have the auction lane open for folks to bid in that kind of thing. So again, small tests, we're going to continue to see what we can learn. But to your point, we feel great about the margins what we can put on cars. But again, we always are looking to get a little better. Chris Bottiglieri : That\u2019s okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just two very quick follow-ups or clarifications. In the press release you said total interest margin would level off in 2024. I'm just curious as we look at the last three years running in \u201821 and \u201820, you did about 7% collateral spreads in those pools and in the last four, you did 4% collateral spreads. Is there something in sort of the forward market or what you're about to launch where you think the spreads are going to open up quite a bit. It just seems hard to understand how -- if we think about this -- that, that spreads could level off and maybe not compress? And then just a second question, Bill, on the franchise -- I'm sorry, on the market share gains. Is there room to gain in the six to 10-year old segment? I mean, if you kind of think about that 4% in one -- in the zero to 10-year old market, is there significant room in these older vehicles where you might have higher grosses over time? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, thanks John for the question. I'll take the NIM one. So I think first -- most important to point out is you're coming off of probably a 10-year peak in Q1 previous of this year. You really benefited from low funding costs. Lenders were able to capture a lot of margin there. You look at some of those deals you referenced, I mean, very, very strong margin. So while we'd love to have been to stay up there, it was probably never going to happen and you've seen us come down sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I think if you look at what -- how we have been able to raise rates for our consumers and obviously, Enrique already mentioned earlier, we do think that the ABS market is kind of improving. We're probably better matched with our rates to how we'll do long-term funding costs out there. And so we think that when we look out, you never know where funding costs are going to go, you never know what consumers are going to walk through the door. Ultimately, we need to remain competitive and make sure that we're able to sell cars and provide competitive rates for our consumers. But when we look out, we've come down off of this peak. We think that we're well matched with our rates versus what we can fund this stuff for in the future and we do think we can level off in \u201824. John Murphy : I'm sorry, does the match mean that you're going to get back to 5% to 6% collateral spreads you think in the near future? That's what you've seen, but things are somewhat more normal. So I\u2019m just curious if that's what you think you're going to get to soon? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes. If you just look at those previous deals, you look at the \u201823 one deal, again, an APR of 9.09%, we just referenced that we're at 10.9% this quarter and I could tell you that's not where we ended the quarter, so you're going to see in subsequent deals APR is higher if funding costs are more reasonable, I think we're absolutely going to be better matched funding costs for rate out there, that's exactly what I'm referring to. John Murphy : Thank you. Bill Nash : And John, on the market share the six, 10, remember, we always measure market share zero to 10. I do think six to 10 is an opportunity. I mean, if you look at our recent sales like even this quarter, vehicle is over six years over 60,000 miles. If I look at where we were year-over-year, we're probably 10 points higher, we're probably high 30s as a percent of sale. The real question will be is prices come down. Do consumers start to go back to newer model vehicles? So we'll see, I think we're in a great position. We obviously have shown that we can acquire those vehicles and recondition them. So it's a great lever as we go forward. John Murphy : Okay. When you just think of that as a structural opportunity, right? I mean, if those consumers go back to the younger, cheaper vehicles, you still have those 10-year old vehicles that you can sell. Wouldn't that just augment your, sort of, long-term structural growth? I mean, I'm just curious, I mean, it just seems like a huge opportunity. Bill Nash : Yes, I think so. But again, some of it will be just on consumer demand. If the folks that are coming into our stores are looking for later model vehicles, lower mileage, we're certainly going to put more of those on our lot, so we'll manage to whatever the consumer is looking for. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Pierce with Needham. Your line is open. Chris Pierce : Hey, good morning. About halfway through Q1 here, I was just curious if you could comment on used ASPs, retail ASPs and what you're seeing? They came down 7% sequentially in Q4, but I know Q3 was a little bit artificially inflated. Just given that's been talked about wholesale demand and strong wholesale price increases as a trace, if that's flowing through the retail or not as much, because of the retail wholesale spread? Just kind of curious what you're seeing quarter-to-date for retail ASPs? Bill Nash : Yes, I think, Chris, it's a little early, because the vehicles we're selling right now, we sourced in the last quarter. So I don't think it's really going to impact up to this point what your retail ASPs are. So I would think about this quarter right now, our retail ASPs are probably similar to what they were for the quarter. And again, we had a little bit of appreciation that we saw there. Keep in mind that the depreciation flows through much quickly on the wholesale cars, because you're turning those -- that inventory every seven days. Chris Pierce : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : And the next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious if you've seen a noteworthy pullback from CAF lending partners or I'm sorry from your lending partners, because your CAF gross penetration was up 330 bps. And related to that, Jon, I think you said earlier, you wanted to -- your goal is just to add new lenders. Were you talking about ABS lending or also for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, just to your first question, David. Yes, certainly when partners pull back, the pie sums to a 100, so CAF can benefit from that. But I think CAF's penetration is really again us remaining competitive in that tier space and winning the volume outright. But yes, we did see our Tier 2 partners certainly pull back, Tier 3 tends to benefit from that, because those customers who typically would be Tier 2 may move down and get picked up by Tier 3. But I think that just speaks to the quality of our platform, right? If CAF pulls back Tier 2 picks up, if Tier 2 pulls back Tier 3 picks up or other partners in Tier 2, but we did see pullback in the Tier 2 space certainly. And your second question was probably with regard to my prepared remarks and about adding a subsequent lender, we were referring to the FBS platform. We have five, again, long-term lenders on there, which means that they are operating with a soft pull they are decisioning all the vehicles using their models in minutes and getting it back to us so we can provide that to the consumer and provide as rich an offer as possible. Every lender you add, we added one in Q4, we hope to add another one in Q1 just further strengthens the set of offers across all the inventory that the customer can see and helps them to convert. So that's what I was referring to. Bill Nash : And those are -- David, those are long-term lenders that we already have that we're pulling in [Multiples Speakers] Jon Daniels : Absolutely, it\u2019s not adding a brand new lender, although I'm sure we have plenty of lenders that would love to come into our space. But this is existing in our typical in-store environments that we're going to add into this again very rich FBS environment. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you. And are you seeing any increase in repossessions or do you expect that to happen later this year? Jon Daniels : So if your question is, increased repossessions. Obviously, as losses go up, as you're seeing delinquencies certainly in the industry, it will lead to losses then you're going to see added repossession. So I think the entire industry is seeing that. We are seeing that to some degree, if that's your question. David Whiston : Yes. Thank you very much. Jon Daniels : Yes. Operator : Thank you. We don't have any further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining the call and your questions and support. I do want to congratulate all the associates again on being named a great place to work for 19-years in a row. And like I said earlier, we believe we're well positioned to navigate this environment and emerge even stronger. We look forward to talking with everyone next quarter. Take care. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 CarMax earnings release conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Although the first quarter remained challenging due to the same factors we cited in fiscal '23, we're seeing sequential quarterly improvements across our business. We are focused on controlling what we can as we take deliberate steps to support our business for both the near-term and the long run. This quarter, we reduced SG&A independent of the legal settlement. We delivered strong retail GPU. We increased used saleable inventory units while driving down total inventory dollars 13% year-over-year. We drove strong wholesale GPU as our unit volume continued to recover. And finally, we grew CAF's penetration even as we raised CAF's consumer rates to help offset higher cost of funds and tighten lending standards in reaction to the current environment. For the first quarter of FY'24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, down 17% compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 9.6% and used unit comps were down 11.4%, which reflects an improvement from down 22.4% and 14.1% year-over-year during last year's third and fourth quarters. Average selling price declined approximately $1,600 per unit or 5% year-over-year. First quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,361, consistent with the $2,339 last year. Historically, margin tends to run higher during the first quarter compared to the rest of the year. In the current environment, we expect this year's second quarter and full year margins will be similar to last year, slightly ahead of the full year $2,100 to $2,200 range that we spoke to last quarter. As always, we'll continue to test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape. Wholesale unit sales were down 13.6% versus the first quarter last year, which reflects continued improvement from the 36.7% and the 19.3% year-over-year declines during last year's third and fourth quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $2,000 per unit or 18% year-over-year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,042 in line with $1,029 during last year's first quarter. We bought approximately 343,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, down 5% from last year, and an improvement from the 40% and 22% year-over-year declines during last year's third and fourth quarters. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately 323,000 from consumers in the quarter, with a little more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience. As a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We sourced the remaining approximately 20,000 vehicles through dealers, up 20% from last year, supported by Edmunds sales team. In regard to our first quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 11% last year. Approximately 54% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, which is consistent with the prior year. Nearly all of our first quarter wholesale auctions and sales, which represents 20% of total revenue, remained virtual and are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%, which is in line with last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $137 million, down from $204 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contributions in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on managing what is in our control drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across key financial metrics, including unit sales, SG&A leverage, gross profit and EPS. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $1.44, down from $1.56 a year ago. Included in our EPS this quarter was the equivalent of $0.28 or $59 million related to a legal settlement. Total gross profit was $817 million, down 7% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $515 million and wholesale vehicle margin of $168 million declined 9% and 12%, respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across retail and wholesale. This was partially offset by strong margin performance with both retail and wholesale per unit margins up slightly from last year's numbers. Other gross profit was $135 million, up 12% from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by service, which delivered $4 million in margin, a $26 million improvement over last year. As we communicated in our Q4 FY'23 year-end earnings call, our expectation is that service will deliver improved year-over-year performance in FY'24, driven by the efficiency and cost coverage measures that we put in place. Our first quarter has us off to a solid start. The improvement in service was partially offset by reductions in extended protection plan or EPP revenues and third-party finance fees. EPP revenues were down $5 million, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by stronger margins that were implemented at the end of last year's first quarter. Third-party finance fees were down $3 million to last year's first quarter. Lower volume in Tier 2, for which we receive a fee, was partially offset by a reduction in Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $560 million, down 15% from the prior year's quarter. Excluding the benefit from the legal settlement, SG&A was down 6% from the prior year's quarter, as we continue to see the benefits of our cost management efforts. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 68%. Excluding the benefit from the settlement, our SG&A leverage was 76%, roughly flat to last year's first quarter. The change in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following factors. First, other overhead decreased by $79 million, of which $59 million was due to the settlement. The balance of year-over-year favorability was driven by several factors, including favorability in non-CAF uncollectible receivables, which benefited partially from timing, favorability and costs associated with lower staffing levels and a variety of other smaller costs. Second, we reduced advertising by $17 million. While our advertising expense on a total dollar and per unit basis was lower year-over-year on the quarter, our investments for the quarter on a per unit basis remained aligned with last year's second half spend level. Third, total compensation and benefits, excluding a $13 million increase in share-based compensation decreased $15 million. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus in stores and CECs on aligning staffing levels to sales and driving efficiency gains. As I noted in our Q4 FY'23 year-end call, we expect to require low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full FY'24 year, well below the levels we guided to during the investment heavy phases of our omni transformation. As a result, we expect to deliver stronger flow through of gross profit to profitability. Our first quarter performance has us on track to deliver on this goal. While we delivered SG&A leverage point in the mid 70% range in the first quarter, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our strongest for SG&A leverage as it's historically our highest used unit volume and margin per unit quarter. Regarding capital structure, our first priority remains to fund the business While our adjusted net debt to capital ratio was slightly below our 35% to 45% targeted range, given ongoing market uncertainties, we continue to appropriately manage our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. In keeping with this goal of maintaining flexibility, we continue to pause our share buybacks in the first quarter. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place, as does our commitment to return capital to shareholders over time. Additionally, post quarter calendar end, we successfully renewed our $2 billion revolving lending facility with materially similar terms. We plan to include additional information in our forthcoming 10-Q, which we plan to file on Monday. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.3 billion, resulting in penetration of 42.7% net of three-day payoffs, up from 39.3% observed during the first quarter last year. This growth in penetration came despite cash credit tightening within the higher risk, higher APR portion of Tier 1 as well as the reduction of CAF's targeted volume of Tier 3 that began at the end of Q4. Despite the decrease of volume in these higher APR segments, the weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.1%, an increase of 20 basis points from Q4 and 200 basis points from the same period last year. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 20.4% up from Q4, but still down from the historically high 25.2% seen in Q1 of FY'23. Tier three penetration was 6.7%, down 40 basis points from last year. While CAF and other lending partners have tightened lending standards over the previous few quarters, our robust multi-lender credit platform was still able to approve approximately 95% of credit applications during the first quarter. CAF income for the quarter was $137 million, down from $204 million in the same period last year. This $67 million year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a $23 million increase in loss provision, as well as a $94 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by growth in interest and fee income. Note our interest expense was impacted by a negative $9 million fair market value adjustment from our hedging strategy versus a positive $9 million adjustment seen in the same period last year. Within the quarter, total interest margin decreased to $258 million, down $40 million from the same period last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.1% continued to come down from the 10-year peak seen in last year's first quarter, but has moderated in its decline from previous quarters, as was expected and previewed during last quarter's conference call. The slowing in NIM reduction comes as a result of targeted rate increases on new originations executed over the last year that effectively manage CAF penetration, finance margin and sales conversion to generate the most valuable outcome for CarMax as a whole. The loan loss provision in Q1 of $81 million results in an ending reserve balance of $535 million or 3.11% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $507 million last quarter, which was 3.02% of receivables. The sequential nine basis point adjustment in the reserve receivable ratio reflects unfavorable performance within the existing portfolio as well as the uncertain macro environment. Despite this increase, the existing Tier 1 portfolio continues to trend within the targeted 2% to 2.5% cumulative net credit loss range and the recent tightening is expected to provide a reduction in loss rate for future originations. Regarding continued improvements in our best-in-class pre-qualification product. During the first quarter, we began broadly scaling yet another of our large lending partners within FBS, our finance based shopping platform. This marks the sixth lender that is now capable of providing millions of additional customized credit decisions in minutes to our online customers. While we continue to add enhancements to our online credit experience, we believe our FBS platform is currently an industry leader and truly empowers consumers by providing simple access to penny perfect multi-lender credit decisions in seconds while having no impact to their credit score. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon. Over the past several years, we've built a leading omni-channel platform that enables us to deliver what we believe is the most customer centric experience in the industry. Our ability to offer integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market and is a key differentiator. With our core omni capabilities now in place, we are continuing to prioritize projects that drive operating efficiencies and optimize experience for our associates and customers. We believe the steps we will be taking enable us to further expand our competitive moat and will position us well for the future. Some examples from the first quarter beyond what Jon just spoke about related to CAF include one, as we work to deliver a seamless digital first shopping experience, we are increasingly leveraging Sky our 24/7 virtual assistant. Sky enables us to efficiently assist customers via chat functionality while taking work out of our CEC system. During the first quarter, we expanded these capabilities to include workflows related to finance applications, vehicle transfers and appointment reservations. Since going live, we've had great success reducing CEC work volume routed to associates, enabling us to provide a quicker response at a lower cost per transaction. We anticipate rolling out additional functionality to Sky throughout fiscal 2024. Second, we are currently rolling out express drop off, which enables customers with instant offer or store generated appraisals to progress the selling process from home. When utilized, this option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in under 30 minutes and our research shows that customers and associates both love this experience. Finally, we're continuing to modernize our auction platform to enhance the experience for dealers. This quarter, we launched an integrated check-in experience that enables single sign-on across our systems and streamlines access to the information that dealers rely on the most when bidding on vehicles. Additionally, we initiated proxy bidding capabilities in a limited number of markets. This allows dealers to bid on vehicles in advance so they don't have to participate live during each auction. It also unlocks the ability to take part in multiple auctions and bid on multiple vehicles simultaneously. Feedback on both of these capabilities has been positive. We plan to expand proxy bidding to additional markets as well as launch other enhancements in upcoming quarters. With our focus on improving experiences and gaining efficiencies, we believe we are well positioned to emerge from the current environment and even stronger company. We're confident in the future of our diversified business model and believe that the deliberate steps that we are taking will enable us to drive robust growth as the market improves. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. Chelsea? Chelsea, can you remind folks of how to enter the question portal. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Bill Nash : Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel : So the question I'll ask with one question, but I'll have two parts of it. Just maybe you could talk about the market share dynamic you witnessed here early in, I guess, so far in the year? And then secondarily, as you talked about in your script, we are seeing this improving [indiscernible] in used car sales, obviously, still down year-on-year, but better than it had been in the prior two quarters. If you look at the drivers behind that, is that more what CarMax is doing? Or you've seen an excess solidifying backdrop within the sector? Thank you. Bill Nash : Yeah, great. Thank you for the question, Brian. First of all, on the market share question, Brian, you might remember that last quarter, given the title data that we had, we thought we had bottomed out in the December, January time frame. We actually have title data now through April, and we did bottom out in December. And although we aren't growing it year-over-year yet, we're pleased that January through April, we saw some good sequential growth, and we did that while maintaining strong margins. So we feel good about the trajectory we're on. And if I compare it to previous times when we had given up market share, again, we talked about that last quarter, COVID in '08, '09. I would tell you the coming out of it is more similar to the COVID period than the '08,'09. As far as your second question on just the used car sales, yes, I mean, the overall used market obviously is still depressed. I do think while depreciation is a little bit of a headwind on parts of the business, so for example, wholesale, I think it's good for the overall industry. So having vehicles depreciate during the quarter, I think, was a good thing. It was a little unusual quarter because it first started off appreciating and then it ended up actually decreasing a little bit. So I think that's a - I think that's good for the industry. But I think there's also things that are specific to CarMax and how we're managing our inventory, how we're managing our margin, the right cars out there that are unique to CarMax. So I think it's probably a combination of both. Brian Nagel : I appreciate all the color, Bill. Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question as well. I'm trying to anticipate down the road when student loan payments are required again. Do you have a feel for the percentage of your buyers that are also making student loan payments and whether that could be a significant impact on demand? Bill Nash : Yes. That's a great question, Craig. It's one that we've actually talked about internally, both from a sales standpoint and from a finance standpoint. I think from a sales standpoint, it's hard to tell because folks have been taking consumer loans out for longer periods of time. And I would think probably the majority of our customers are outside of the student loan -- the majority of our retail customers are outside of that period. I think when you think about the CAF business, and Jon, you might have some different thoughts on this. But when you think about the CAF business, because we skew to a higher credit customer, that probably puts us in a little bit better position, but I don't know if you have any additional thoughts beyond that? Jon Daniels : Yeah, I agree, Bill. I mean, certainly, the prime customer is probably a little bit older. But I think when we are looking at our underwriting platform, our underwriting criteria and our models, we're always going to take into account total outstanding debt for the consumer evaluate the things that are most predictive of auto loan payback. And so that would be contemplated in our underwriting criteria. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Bill Nash : Good morning. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Good morning. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to start on our focus on the SG&A results, obviously impressive in the quarter. Maybe two-parter related to that. First, within other maybe overhead, historically, I thought a lot of that was IT kind of e-commerce investment. Other than headcount reduction, can you maybe talk about Enrique some of the operational changes you made to drive that improvement in that line item and maybe the sustainability? And then related, I think you said there was a onetime benefit from the timing of some CAF receivables in the quarter. Could you quantify that just to help investors underwrite that outlook as well as in the SG&A line? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Great. Thank you for the question. Yeah, let me take it kind of one by one. So let me first define non-CAF finance receivables. We haven't talked about it too much in the past. We have a little bit, but not too much. So those are primarily loans that are financing partners issue to our customers that we end up writing off either due to title processing issues or down payment obligations. And if you go back to when we emerge from COVID, we had low staffing, we had high turnover and there were a lot of DMV delays, right? And emerging from that, we've re-staffed, we've trained up our stores, DMVs are moving faster. So we're actually able to kind of catch-up on these non-CAF finance receivables and execute better. Stores are executing. Our home office is executing. And again, the DMVs are executing as well better than they were. And as a result, we've seen some favorability in that line. I did talk to some favorability due to timing. So part of that is due to timing. What I'd tell you, that's not timing that will come back and hit us in the future. It's more of a change in estimates that we have and what we think we'll be writing off. So it's a little bit more of a hindsight change, so it won't hit us moving forward. So that's number one. That was kind of the biggest favorability we saw on the quarter year-over-year. As well, we did see some favorability related to headcount, which I mentioned, related to staffing levels. Specifically, as we've staffed down and rightsized, we have favorability in relocation expenses, as you'd imagine, in recruiting expenses, as you'd imagine, but then also in casual labor. And all of those hit the other bucket. So we see favorability there. We are still seeing a little bit of pressure from decisions we made in prior quarters on our technology and strategic growth. So that's still growing a little bit within that bucket, but it's being offset pretty materially by the other areas. Daniel Imbro : Okay. Thanks for all the color, guys. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to actually ask some questions about Sky because I don't recall you talking about Sky previously. So how - I mean, how far do you think you can take, I guess, what I'll call an AI technology to help kind of make the CECs more efficient? And how should we think about if there's any kind of step-up in investment that would be related to kind of enhancing or optimizing Sky further, if that makes sense. Bill Nash : Yeah. No, great question, Sharon. First of all, just AI in general, I think we're bullish on AI in general. We've been using OpenAI for a period of time now. We think about it, there's lots of opportunities to enhance our associates' work, maybe take some of the more mundane stuff out. Particular to Sky, we talked about Sky, I can't remember if we've actually named it Sky in the past, but we talked about a virtual assistant. So that's what our virtual system that's called is Sky. And we're really pleased. One of the things that we've been on a path to is really making our CECs as efficient as possible and leveraging our associates for the really value-added work. And this quarter with the improvements that we saw with Sky, we really deflected a good amount of calls to the CEC that Sky was able to handle independent of calling in. And the areas that we put in there were the prequel, the transfer process and appointment setting. And the way that it's working right now, which I think is really kind of the first version of it is, Sky hooks them up with a link. We see a world where Sky will actually interact back and forth and not even necessarily have to hook up with a link. So I think that's an enhancement. Another enhancement we'll be looking at is just integrating IO with Sky. So I think there's opportunity -- still a lot of opportunity just in the CECs with Sky, but I also think there's a lot of opportunity just AI in general. We've used it in training our CECs consultants, and we think there's additional possibility there. We've used OpenAI to assist in our vehicle reviews and customer reviews, really allowing our content team to focus on more insightful stuff. And like I said, we're working on a proof-of-concept, a knowledge proof-of-concept for our CECs to allow them to access very specific state information. So again we're excited about it. Enrique Mayor-Mora: What I'd say as well just building on that is Sky has been a pretty strong contributor to helping us get our operating model even more efficient than where we've been in the past. We've shown sequential improvements now in quarter-over-quarter costs when it comes to the CECs and the operating model, and that's on a per retail unit basis. And when you consider total units, so use and wholesale or even gross margin dollars, we -- the progress has been even stronger. So it has been a pretty material -- it's had a pretty material impact to the efficiency of our model, and it's contributing to the SG&A gains that we're seeing. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Sharon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just one very quick follow-up. Is there a way to quantify the timing that you got from -- or timing benefit you got on SG&A from the non-CAF uncollectible receivables just in a dollar sense? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. I would say the timing was not all that material in the scope of things. I'll give you a dollar number, but it's not all that material in the scope of things. The majority of the benefit really was from that improvement in execution, from our stores, from our home office and from the DMVs as well. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a question, Bill, as you think about the same-store sales comps, I mean, it's tough to call exactly when things will inflect. I'd love to hear your opinion about when you think they may inflect. But if they don't, is there an opportunity to potentially get more aggressive on SG&A costs through headcount reduction or other areas in case we're in an environment where affordability and supply remain a pretty material issue? Bill Nash : Yeah. So John, what I'd say on the cadence as far as being able to flip that. But really the only thing I can point to, which is what I've talked about in the past is just when we've seen this in the past, how long is it generally taken? And I think if you go back to '08, '09, I think it took us about seven to eight months before we flattened and then started growing it year-over-year. You look at COVID, it was more in the four to five month range. So again, I feel good about the progress we're seeing there. Now as far as your second part of the question, which is the SG&A reduction. Look, hopefully, we made it very clear that we are very focused on this SG&A, so reduction. So whether wherever the market share goes, we're going to continue to move that. But regardless of that, we're going to continue to focus on continuing to prove SG&A with things like we've been talking about with Sky and becoming more efficient in the CEC, becoming more efficient in the stores. There really isn't one piece of the business where we don't have efficiency plays that we're currently looking at. So it doesn't matter if it's a business office, service operations, merchandising, every single department we have internal goals that we're going after. So regardless of the market share, we're going after continued efficiency. John Murphy : And that target of low 70%, I mean, is that a one or two year target? Or is that an eventual? How should we think about getting there, the time frame? Enrique Mayor-Mora: We want to get there as fast as we can. It's also going to require the gross profit improves as well. So it's critical that the underlying business and the macro environment improves as well, and then we'll get there. This quarter was particularly strong. The first quarter, again, is usually the strongest quarter for the reasons I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right? But we do expect the rest of the year to continue to deliver on our commitment for this year, which is a low single-digit gross profit in order to lever, which is a material difference from where we've been over the past few years in our heavy investment phase. But 70% is our next step is what we mentioned. And from there, we can hopefully even lever even more in the years beyond. But 70% is our next step. Bill Nash : Yes, John, I think we talked about last quarter that well, for this year, we need the macro conditions to continue to improve to get there. If that doesn't happen this year, we wouldn't expect this to be a two-year thing. We would expect to get back there next year. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. And that's in the mid 70% range, right? John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. John Healy : Great. Thank you for taking my question. We haven't heard the word affordability used on this call compared to the last couple. And my thought is that your performance probably reflects you guys kind of changing and adjusting the merchandise you have on the lots and the site to meet retail demand. Can you kind of talk about how the -- maybe the mix and the age or the mileage of the vehicles that you're selling today looks versus a few months ago? And maybe just the multiyear outlook for supply because I think there's some concern in the market about your ability to source vehicles kind of in that late model category given the fact that they might not exist for the next couple of years. So just love to kind of hear your thoughts about what you're selling today and what you think your merchandise mix might look like for the next year or two? Bill Nash : Yeah, great. Thank you for the questions, John. So I think from a affordability, look, there's still an affordability issue out there. Even though our average selling price is down, it's still up substantially over where it used to be. And I think in the previous calls, we've said, hey, if you think about the affordability, 85% has been driven by the vehicle price, 15% is driven by the interest rates. I think we're probably more in a 75-25, which is more driven by the prices coming down, which automatically gets your interest rates makes a little bit more. But I think we've knock on wood, I think we've kind of peaked on what the increase in payments. I think we were running. If you look at just the CAF business, we were running about 150 monthly higher than pre-normal times and I think we're probably down to 130 or so. So there is still absolutely an affordability issue. I think your question is great when you think about the mix. Our prices were down roughly $1,600. But the interesting thing, while your acquisition price is down almost and that was more than 50% of the price swing. There's also a bit of an age mix thing here as well. And what I mean by that is if you look at the zero to four-year-old cars that we sold a year ago compared to the zero to four-year-old cars that we sold this year, we had less percent of those. So we dropped a few points, which means less of those newer cars and what you've shifted to is we've actually seen a little bit of uptick in the eight plus. And so that obviously is going to drive down your overall selling price. It's also a little bit of a tailwind for us on margins as well, which played out in the quarter. I think the last part of your question, which was the supply. We've gotten this question in the past. And what I would tell you is the fact that the new car sales rate has been off of what it traditionally is, that's not an environment that we're unfamiliar with working in because if I think back in the past, we've seen that before back in the '08, '09, the reduction in new car sales was actually more dramatic than it is now. If you look at the new car sales that we've been experiencing here more recently, we still haven't hit some of the numbers that you saw back coming out of '08 and '09. So and we were able to manage through that period very well. And I would tell you, we have a better tool in the toolbox this time with self-sufficiency being so high. So we're not worried about the availability of inventory just like we haven't really been worried about it over the last year. Enrique Mayor-Mora: The only piece I'd add to that from an inventory mix standpoint is like for customers over 25% of our cars are less than $20,000. And last year, in the first quarter, that was closer to 20%, right? So now we're up over 25%. So in terms of customers, we are mixing the right inventory to make sure we're being as affordable as we can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Bill Nash : Hey, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning. Can you help us understand what the exit comp rate was in the quarter? And then related to that, your 95% credit approval rate. Is that actually higher on a year-over-year basis? In other words, did traffic drop more than what you saw in -- or what we saw in the comp results? Bill Nash : I'll take the comps and I'll pass it over to Jon to talk about the other questions. So the way I think about the kind of the comp cadence, it was pretty steady throughout the whole quarter. I mean there wasn't any remarkable difference month-to-month. If you look at the quarter as a whole, that's kind of how each month basically performed. And then Jon I'll toss it to you on the credit. Jon Daniels : Yeah, on the 95% credit approval, right, again, that's anybody that's applying for credit, whether it be online or directly in the store where they start. That's similar to what we've stated before. And I think, frankly, in this environment with the tightening that we've seen from the partner lenders and CAF. I think it just speaks to the robustness of our platform to maintain that level. So we feel real good about that number. Scot Ciccarelli : Right. Can I have a follow-up question on that? Bill Nash : Sure. Scot Ciccarelli : If everyone's tightening credit, how does the approval rates stay flat? Is it just fewer and fewer people and it's better qualified people coming in? Like, is that the way to interpret that? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yeah, fair question. And that speaks to the uniqueness of the platform. So let's say, perhaps the approval still there, but it's at a higher interest rate where you're asking for a little more money down or get moved from lender A to lender B further down the platform. But again, that's the benefit of having those multiple lenders and those multiple tiers is. We're at least still able to provide some level of credit to the consumer to at least contemplate purchasing the car. Scot Ciccarelli : So the approval includes changes in what those terms are. So like you know we'll still preview. Jon Daniels : That's correct. It does. So it might not be as strong of an approval, and that's sort of the tightening as opposed to maybe a single lender platform where it's just, look, I can't approve view period. We've got other lenders to provide alternatives. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Super helpful. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Montani with Evercore. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just first off, I was wondering, if you could discuss at all, comp trends quarter-to-date. And then also what you're seeing in terms of inventory levels. We had seen, I think, an increase now year-over-year to start the quarter. So I just wanted to understand that. And then I had a follow-up. Bill Nash : Yes. So I think as far as comp trends quarter-to-date, I would look to similar to where we ended the quarter. I think on the inventory levels, look, I was really pleased the team has done a phenomenal job. As I said in my opening remarks, we actually took the total dollar amount down yet we increased our saleable and they're doing a great job making sure that we're getting cars through even with delays on parts that kind of thing. So we typically go down a little bit of inventory. And this month, this quarter, we actually -- when you go from Q4 to Q1. And this year, we actually went up a little bit. So we feel good. We're still -- if I think about the traditional stores, we're a little bit lighter than where we normally are, but I think that's appropriate in this type of selling environment. So I think from an inventory standpoint, we're in good shape. Michael Montani : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the share components, understanding historically, it could be like a seven to nine month type of issue. But if that continues to persist, should we anticipate incremental investments, either from GPUs or potentially ad expense or headcount? Or do you think that basically that's not necessary because it's more industry demand dynamics that are driving it? Bill Nash : Yeah. I feel good about where we are right now. Obviously, you've got to continue to monitor the competitive landscape. You've got to come in, continue to monitor price elasticity, especially when it comes to the GPUs. But as I said earlier, we're working on efficiencies regardless of market share. But again, I would just reiterate that I feel good about the growth that we're seeing so far. And I'm positive about the outlook in front of us. Michael Montani : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is really around GPU and the better performance in retail GPU for the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was driven by market pricing dynamics relative to other internal factors? Bill Nash : Yeah. What I would say is the -- as far as our price elasticity test goes, it really hasn't changed much, which is why we continue to see strong margins. We continue to have great self-sufficiency. We continue to have a mix of older vehicles, which are more profitable. All those certainly help. In my prepared remarks, I heard that I said that since the last quarter, we were talking about if you think about the full year, $2,100 to $2,200, we're actually updating on that a little bit just to be between $2,200 and $2,300 more similar to last year, especially as you look at the second quarter. So again, I feel good about where we are. We'll continue to measure the macro factors, but we do have some nice efficiencies that we've picked up that we've been able to take a little bit to the bottom line as well as continue to pass through the customer. So we feel great about our prices. Seth Basham : And as a follow-up, do you think you can hit that $2 million unit sales both for fiscal '26 with retail GPUs in that $2,100 to $2,200 normalized range? Bill Nash : Yeah. As we said the last quarter, we're going to stick by those long-term ranges. We'll update it at the end of the year. A lot can happen in one year. But, yes, we're not changing that guidance at this point. Seth Basham : Fair enough. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thanks, Seth. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. One on the other gross profit line, the services efficiency that you mentioned. Is there a way to give us a little more granularity on the $25 million year-over-year improvement there because revenues did not go up that much. Does it come primarily from reduced headcount or any other areas that you can flag? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rajat. So really two things drove that, right? Within bucket of service, service is really where we saw the year-over-year increase, about $26 million. And actually, we're able to deliver profitability and service, which we haven't done in a couple of years in the quarter here. So we're really pleased with the progress that we've made. Two things have driven that. Number one is we took cost coverage metrics -- measures, I'm sorry. So as you recall, we've been hit by inflation for a good period of amount of time here. And we took increase in rates in labor. We took increase in rates and parts, and that has allowed us to cover the inflationary pressures that we've been facing. That's number one. Number two, really strong focus on efficiency still a headwind year-over-year, especially with sales still being challenged. But we've shown now sequential improvement in driving efficiency in the service department. So we've reduced labor along with retaining our tech, which is critical right? But we have been able to reduce labor. We're also in a little bit more of a stable sales environment, which allows for more effective scheduling. And so those are the primary reasons why we've seen that benefit. I would expect that year-over-year benefit to continue for the rest of the year. Whether or not service will be profitable for the year, we'll see, right? But what we do know is that we do expect from a year-over-year basis to show some pretty considerable improvements year-over-year for the rest of the year. Rajat Gupta : Got it. That's helpful. May I just ask one quick one on CAF since I haven't been much asked yet. Just on the provisioning improvement, on a year-over-year basis or more on a sequential basis. Is there an element of recoveries that you can talk about that might have benefited sequentially? Or if you could just generally talk about what you saw from a recovery standpoint, either frequency or severity and anyway to think about provisions over the next couple of quarters? Thanks. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yeah, I appreciate the question, Rajat. Yeah, I'll just talk about the provision sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I think that's driven primarily by some of the tightening that we've done. Obviously, you're going to provision for your new originations within the quarter. So if you tighten and that's going to come in at a lower loss rates then there's just less money that you need to put towards those receivables. I mean, obviously, we then make adjustments on existing portfolio accordingly. So I think that's some of what you're seeing there. With regard to your recovery rates, I'll just speak in general around that. Historically, we're between 40% to 60% on our recovery rate. Obviously, with vehicle values very high. We enjoyed recovery rates in the 70% range. Year-over-year, we're probably down 13 points -- 12 to 13 points were actually up sequentially. So, yes, I don't think recovery rate that was playing a large piece of that. I think units still carry the day here and again, hopefully, that explains the provisioning down quarter-over-quarter. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Just to clarify, you mentioned 70% on the recovery in the quarter? Jon Daniels : So the recovery rate for the quarter was -- I think the numbers were let's see, I think we'll show it about 59% to 60% when all is counted. So which we were 73% to 74% last year, we were about 57% last quarter. So just obviously down year-over-year, but a tick up quarter-over-quarter. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Bill Nash : Sure. Thanks, Rajat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Pierce with Needham. Your line is open. Chris Pierce : Hey, Bill, you talked in your remarks about feeling better about the macro as wholesale prices come in quicker than they normally do at this time of the year, if I understood that right. Are you feeling better about the used car macro environment returning to a 40 million unit number at a sooner rate than you had previously thought based on kind of what you're seeing out there? Just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about bigger picture? Bill Nash : Yeah. No, I don't -- I think it's too early to make that call. My comments around the depreciation, I think what we're seeing now is depreciation, which you would normally see. If you go back to the old normal -- the normalized environment, which is hard to remember back then, typically, you see depreciation this time of the year into the fall. So I think we're seeing that and again, while it can be a bit of a headwind for the wholesale business, I think overall, it's good for the industry because it just makes those cars more affordable, especially for a consumer that budget pinched. So I think it's still a little too early to say we're going to get back to $40 million right away, but I think the more prices move down, the better that is for the industry. Chris Pierce : Okay. And then on used GPU. The question was asked about of lack of new car sales leading the lack of used car sales and you guys retailing older vehicles, if I understood that right. If you're going to be retailing older vehicles for the next multiple years, is that a multiyear tailwind for used GPU? I know you raised it to $2,200 to $2,300, what we just saw come in above $2,361. So I'm just curious if there will be upside to that number even if you're retailing more aged vehicles than you normally would prior? Bill Nash : Yeah. No, I wouldn't think of it as more upside. I mean as Enrique said in his comments and in the script, the first quarter is generally your strongest quarter from a margin standpoint. The turns on inventory, less markdowns, that kind of thing. So while the older vehicle mix absolutely helps us from a margin standpoint. We've been seeing this play out over the last year because we've had a higher mix of older vehicles that we've been selling. And really that's being determined by the customer. So if the customer wants to continue to see older vehicles, we'll make sure we have plenty of that inventory out there. If pricing comes back in line, over a period of time, and all of a sudden, your later model vehicles are more affordable, especially in comparison to new cars then some consumers may migrate there. I think that's the beauty of the business models that we can put out on the lot, whatever customers are looking for. And we have the capability to go older and we have the capability to go newer, just depends on what the customer is looking for. Chris Pierce : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious on electric vehicles with such a huge surge in demand on the new vehicle side. Are you seeing that on the used vehicle side too? Or is affordability kind of muting that EV demand for used buyers? Bill Nash : Yeah, David, thank you for the question. So I think if you think about CarMax as a whole and the number of EVs we actually sell, it's a very small percent. And I think probably last quarter, it was roughly on pure EVs around 1%, maybe a little bit more. And we've seen that number tick up a little bit. As you can imagine, there just hasn't been a lot of EVs out there in the marketplace for you. Now, obviously, all the manufacturers are putting out more EV product. I do think, I mean, you point out a good thing on affordability. I think they have to become a little bit more affordable for the average consumer. But that being said just like we're the retailer of used vehicles. We want to be the retailer, the largest retailer have used EVs. And so we're preparing for that. While it's a small percentage of our sales now, we think that, that will grow over time. And so we're already taking steps to make sure that we can be prepared for that. David Whiston : Okay. And just one thing on FBS. Can FBS customers loan eventually go into a CAFs securitization? Or does it have to stay with an external lending partner? Enrique Mayor-Mora: No. CAF is one of the six lenders that are currently operating on FBS. And again, that's the online shopping tool. So, yes, absolutely, all lenders -- all of those lenders are participating in CAF loans. We'll absolutely underwrite folks in FBS and it will go through our normal funding channels. Bill Nash : Yeah. David, that's the FBS is all the different lending partners. It's a very unique product out in the marketplace because it's not only CAF, but it's our additional lending partners that have been with us forever. And at the end of the day, that's what gets consumers, especially ones that are conscious about their monthly payment, it gets them the best rate. David Whiston : Did you give an FBS penetration number? Bill Nash : You mean as far as how many consumers are leveraging FBS? Jon Daniels : Yeah. I think what we would say is of the people that apply for credit, 80% plus are starting online and leveraging our online platform. Bill Nash : Yeah, and everybody can do an FBS experience. It just depends on how they want to shop. David Whiston : Okay. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us and your questions and your support. As always, I want to thank our associates for what they do, taking care of each other and the customers. They are absolutely our differentiator. I also would like to remind everybody that's on the call, we recently published our 2023 responsibility report, and I encourage everybody to listen to it. I mean read it, that's listening today. It provides some great updates on some key initiatives, including climate-related and the tangible impact that we're having on community. So again, we're proud of the values that we're living every day and I think we're well positioned to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our shareholders. So again, thank you for your time today, and we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the FY'24 Q1 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Although our second quarter results largely reflect the same widespread pressures that we cited over the past year, we continue to see sequential quarterly improvement across our business. We believe the deliberate steps we are taking to control what we can are supporting our business now while also positioning us well for the future. This quarter we delivered strong retail GPU. We further reduced SG&A year-over-year. We maintained used sellable inventory units at a similar level to the first quarter, while total inventory dollars decreased by 18% year-over-year, split approximately evenly between lower units and reduced acquisition costs. We drove strong wholesale GPU despite experiencing steep depreciation and we stabilized CAF\u2019s net interest margins while we maintained penetration. For the second quarter of FY '24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.1 billion, down 13% compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, while total unit sales declined 7.4% and used unit comps were down 9%, we continued to achieve sequential quarterly improvement. Further, comp sales improved sequentially by month across the second quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $1200 per unit or 4% year-over-year. Retail gross profit per used unit was $2,251, similar to last year's second quarter record high of $2,282. We continue to expect this year's full year per unit margin will be similar to last year. As always, we will continue to test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape. Wholesale unit sales were down 11.2% versus the second quarter last year. Like used unit sales, this reflects continued sequential improvement year-over-year from the second half of last year and this year's first quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $1,300 per unit or 12% year-over-year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $963, up from $881 a year ago. We achieved this despite experiencing steep depreciation that was concentrated primarily in June and July. We bought approximately 292,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, down 15% from last year as we adjusted offers to reflect the steep depreciation that we're seeing in the marketplace. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately 273,000 from consumers in the quarter with a little more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience. As a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. Supported by Edmunds sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 19,000 vehicles through dealers, down 5% from last year. In regard to our second quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 11% last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 53% in the prior year. Nearly all of our second quarter wholesale auctions in sales, which represents 19% of total revenue remained virtual and are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%, up slightly from 30% last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $135 million, down from $183 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and cash contributions in a few minutes. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across key financial metrics, including unit sales, wholesale margins, gross profit, SG&A, and EPS. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.75 versus $0.79 a year ago. Total gross profit was $697 million, down 5% from last year's second quarter. Used retail margin declined by 9% to $452 million, driven by lower volume at similar per unit margins. Wholesale vehicle margin declined by 3% to $137 million with a decrease in volume partially offset by stronger per unit margin performance. Other gross profit was $108 million, up 6% from last year's second quarter. This increase was driven by service, which delivered a $20 million improvement over last year with this year's quarter reporting a $14 million loss. As we communicated in our last two earnings calls, our expectation is that service will deliver improved year-over-year performance for FY '24 as a result of the efficiency and cost coverage measures that we've put in place. The extent of the improvement will also depend on sales performance given the leveraged deleveraged nature of service. The improvement in service was partially offset by reduction in extended protection planned or EPP revenues and third party finance fees. EPP revenues were down $8 million primarily due to lower sales and were to a lesser degree impacted by slightly lower penetration rates, partially due to recent pricing increases taken to offset cost pressures experienced by our third party providers. These items were partially offset by favorability in year-over-year reserve adjustments. Third party finance fees were down $4 million from last year's second quarter, driven by lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter were $586 million, down 12% from the prior year's quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our cost management efforts. To a lesser degree, we also had some timing favorability in the quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 84%, a leverage of 6.3 points as compared to last year's second quarter. The decrease in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following. First, other overhead decreased by $41 million. This decrease was driven by several factors, including continued favorability in non-CAF uncollectible receivables, favorability in costs associated with lower staffing levels, and from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and strategic initiatives, which included a timing benefit this quarter. We also had two smaller items in the quarter that largely offset each other. These consisted of additional settlement dollars from the same class action lawsuit we spoke to in the first quarter, offset by unfavorable self-insured losses related to multiple hailstorm events. Second, total compensation and benefits decreased $28 million, excluding a $7 million increase in share based compensation. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus on driving efficiency gains and aligning staffing levels in stores and CECs to sales. Third, we reduced advertising by $17 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in per unit spend as compared to last year's peak per unit spend, lower volume and timing. As we communicated on our fourth quarter call, as we enter the back half of FY '24, we will have largely anniversaried over the year-over-year benefits from our cost management efforts. With that said, we remain disciplined with our spend. We also expect timing in marketing and technology spend to impact the back half of FY '24. In regard to marketing, we still expect our full year spend on a per unit basis to be similar to FY '23 spend level. Accordingly, our spend in the back half of FY '24 will exceed the per unit spend from the front half. Regarding technology spend, approximately $10 million of the year-to-date, the year-over-year favorability experience and other overhead will hit the back half of FY '24. We remain committed to effectively managing our cost structure. Our performance in the first half of the year has us on track to deliver on our goal of low single digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full year, even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlements. Regarding capital structure, while we paused the repurchase of our common stocks during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we intend to restart our share repurchase program this quarter. We expect a modest initial pace that would be below the average quarterly paces prior to our pause. Our objective is to appropriately manage our net leverage to maintain financial flexibility and to efficiently access capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole, while also returning capital back to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.45 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.2 billion resulting in penetration of 42.8% net of three day payoffs, which was consistent with Q1 and up from 41.2% observed during the second quarter last year. Within the quarter, CAF tightened further within Tier 3 and is retaining only a modest amount of volume at this time. We have however, slightly increased our investment in the Tier 2 space in an effort to continue our learning and additional credit pockets that we believe will provide future opportunity. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.1%, an increase of 170 basis points from the same period last year and in line with Q1. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.1% as a combination of previous lender tightening and consumer hesitation, especially in the lower credit tiers, drove the majority of reduction versus the 21.6% penetration observed last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.4% of sales as compared to 6% last year, as lenders benefited slightly from CAFs and Tier 2s tightening. CAF income for the quarter was $135 million, down from $183 million in the same period last year. This $48 million year-over-year decrease is driven by a $90 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by $60 million of growth in interest and fee income as well as a $14 million increase in loss provision. Note our interest expense was impacted by a negative $1.2 million fair market value adjustment from our hedging strategy versus a positive $9.4 million adjustment seen in the same period last year. Within the quarter, total interest margin on the full portfolio decreased to $265 million, down $30 million from the same period last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.1% however has levelled off as expected and is in line with Q1. I am proud of the teams' continued ability to effectively manage finance margin CAF penetration and sales conversion to benefit CarMax as a whole. The loan loss provision in Q2 of $90 million results in an ending reserve balance of $538 million or 3.08% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $535 million last quarter, which was 3.11% of receivables. The slight reduction in the reserve to receivables rate is a function of the portfolio tightening, partially offset by the modest additional investment in the Tier 2 business and adjustments on loss expectations within the existing portfolio. We believe the tightening will have a positive impact on the future required reserve, but we will also continue to look for opportunities to capture long-term profitability for CarMax while maintaining a targeted Tier 1 cumulative net credit loss rate of 2% to 2.5%. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we believe the steps we are taking in response to the current environment are supporting our business in the near-term while also positioning us well for the long run. We will continue to focus on delivering what we believe is the most customer centric experience in the industry as we prioritize initiatives that drive operational efficiencies and make our omni channel experience faster, simpler and more seamless for our associates and customers. Some examples from the second quarter include for online, we're rolling out a number of new capabilities that enhance our digital shopping experience and our customer experience centers or CECs. We launched a new order processing system. Sales orders generated through the new system automatically connect to customers' online accounts and to our progression tracker. This tool guides customers through each step of the car buying journey and provides a more seamless experience for customers who prefer to blend self-progression with assistance from associates. We've begun testing this system in our stores, which will unlock this functionality for all of our customers, regardless of where they start their buying journey. We are also expanding capabilities for Sky, our 24/7 virtual assistant. As you might recall, Sky enables us to officially assist customers via automated chat functionality while taking work out of our CEC system. In addition to supporting workflows related to the finance applications, vehicle transfers and appointment reservations, Sky is now able to identify customers who have an appraisal instant offer. Sky helps these customers complete the next steps for their trade in. Previously, associates would have to reach out to provide further support. We've been pleased with our customers' adoption of Sky as they progress in their shopping journey. For our stores, we're continuing to leverage data automation to reduce costs and improve transaction speed and accuracy. We have deployed an integrated payoff service in our business office, which allows associates to obtain automated payoff amounts for over 40% of the lenders holding titles for the cars we buy from consumers. In many instances, this service also enables us to receive titles faster by expediting payoffs. For auctions, we continue to test enhancements to our platform by upgrading the information we provide dealers, which enables them to submit more informed bids. For example, we launched the test using technology from our investment and partnership with UBI [ph] that provides more detailed information on tire conditions including brand, speed, size and tread depth of each tire. Dealer feedback on this offering has been positive and we plan to roll out other enhancements in the upcoming quarters. Before turning to Q&A, I want to recognize two significant milestones in the company's history. First, this June, we celebrated the two-year anniversary of welcoming all the talented Edmunds associates to our team. We're very excited with the value that we have created together so far as we continue to build out our vehicle and customer acquisition programs. For example, as I've previously mentioned, we utilized the Edmunds sales team to sign up and support dealers for our Max software product, which has enabled us to extend our market leading position as a buyer of cars. We also recently launched an appraisal tool for dealer websites that makes instant offers based on CarMax's algorithm that are redeemable via Max offer. We have received positive feedback from dealers that are utilizing this service and are pleased with the initial results. Recurrent: Second, we've launched customized range maps on edmunds.com that enable customers to determine how far they can drive on a single charge based on zip code specific to their route. And third, we have built guide to help customers evaluate potential tax credits and incentives for EVs. These cover all available federal and state EV programs, plus thousands of incentive offers from local utilities and municipalities across the country, with more to come. Also this month, we are celebrating CarMax's 30th anniversary. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work that they do. They are the differentiator and they are the key to our success. Not many companies have the opportunity to revolutionize an industry twice. We're proud to have reshaped the used car industry by driving integrity, honesty and transparency in every interaction. We are excited to reshape the industry again by offering a uniquely personalized car buying experience that enables customers to do as much or as little online and in stores they want. We're confident in the future of our diversified business model and believe the deliberate steps we are taking today will drive growth in the years ahead. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Chelsea? Operator : And our first question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Yes, thank you. My question goes to trade in cycles, with rates moving higher, are you seeing elongated trade in cycles from your customers that are reluctant to give up lower rates that they might have locked in during the pandemic? Bill Nash : Yes, Craig, good morning. I think what we're seeing is, there's absolutely some customers that are because of either the affordability issue which really goes into their monthly payment, customers staying on the sidelines, which would answer the question, are the trade in cycles a little longer? Yes, I would say the trade in cycle is a little longer. As far as how to quantify that, I can't give you a specific number, but we absolutely see traffic flow coming in at the top of the funnel where there's interest and again continue to fall off at the conversion point when people actually start to see their monthly payments and this is especially true in the lower credit customers. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hey, guys. Good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Good morning. Jon Daniels : Good morning. Brian Nagel : So I have a couple of questions, I'll merge them together. First off with regard to the buyback, just maybe talk a little about the decision to restart here and then maybe explain a little bit your comment about the modest start, how you expect to start modestly? Then the second question just with respect to demand, so as we're seeing as you highlighted in your comments, there's been a sequential improvement in your used car unit comps and they are still negative, but better than they have been. Comparison is getting easier because you look at the data, are you seeing anything that suggests that, that in certain pockets you're actually seeing real demand improve or maybe some benefits of what you've done to merchandise better older lower priced vehicles? Thanks. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, I'll jump in on the first question. So an important component of our capital allocation strategy has been returning capital back to shareholders. Our goal in that strategy is really to balance investing in the business, ensuring the capital structure that we have is where we want it to be and then returning capital back to shareholders. The past few quarters of our sequential improvement in our performance has really placed us in a position where we're able to restart albeit at a modest pace. Modest really means an initial amount below our average from the pre-pause quarterly pace which was about $150 million a quarter. So initially we're going to begin with roughly $50 million a quarter, plus or minus. It's a quarterly amount that when annualized would roughly offset annual dilution. So it could be a little heavy, it could be a little light in our goal, but that's what we're initially targeting. Bill Nash : Yes, and Brian on the second part of your question, I'll go back to a little bit of what I told Craig. We're seeing good top of funnel folks shopping. It's just when it comes to actually meeting the monthly payments that's where we see the fall off. I think specific to your question, we are seeing still an increased demand for the little bit older vehicles. In our own sales for the quarter, if I think about cars over six years old, 60,000 miles, the sales for that pocket sequentially ticked up not only quarter-over-quarter but certainly year-over-year. So there still is that demand. I think the market data would also tell you if you look at vehicles that are older than 10 years old that sector of vehicle is actually performing a little bit better than the zero to 10 at this point. Brian Nagel : Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on the competitive environment. How are you thinking about the outlook here over the next six months or so based on a shift in demand to those older vehicles as well as the potential ripple effects of the UAW strikes? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, Seth. Well, first of all on the UAW strikes, I think it's a little too early to know exactly what the price -- the precise impact of those strikes are going to be. Obviously we're closely monitoring the situation to try to identify downstream impacts of the vehicle supply pricing and parts and a lot of that's going to depend on how long the strike goes on. Obviously this isn't the first time we've worked through an issue like this and I think it's one of our strengths having gone through cycles like this in the past and been able to navigate them and I don't expect any difference there. I think as far as the competitive environment, again I think consumers are pressured right now and we'll continue to monitor and provide vehicles that are a little bit older. Keep in mind there's a large subset of the zero to 10 year old cars that just don't meet our parameters so much. Our technicians are great and no matter how good they are and how much money we put into them, they just can't make the cut as a CarMax car, and so we're not going to sacrifice on quality. But we'll continue to put out their vehicles that match our quality that they're also looking for. Enrique Mayor-Mora: In terms of affordability as well, we still have over a quarter of our inventory is priced less than $20,000. So in terms of hitting that affordability, it certainly is a focus for us. Seth Basham : Just as a followup, in terms of your ability to source late model vehicles, which are still a majority of what you're selling, are you seeing any more challenges or do you expect that to change going forward? Bill Nash : No, we aren't seeing any anymore. In fact this quarter I think compared to the previous quarter, we actually went up a little bit in the 0 to 4 category as far as sales go. And again I think the fact that our self-sufficiency is above 70% which doesn't take into consideration anything that we're getting through our Max offer and Max offer there's a nice selection of retail cars in there as well. So I haven't really seen much of a change there and again we've been through cycles like this where we've seen a shortage of late model cars to a more extreme degree than we're seeing right now. Seth Basham : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Seth. Operator : Our next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. John Healy : Thank you. I just want to ask a follow-up question to your comment Bill about the conversion cycle. What's happening after that initial disappointment with the consumer that they can't afford the vehicle? Are you seeing them come back a couple of weeks later? Do you think they're going to the private market? Are they just sitting on the sidelines? I know your sales folks are persistent, so we'd just love to kind of get perspective of what's happening after they meet that surprise affordability roadblock. Bill Nash : Yes, it's a great question John. If I look at just web traffic and kind of use that as a proxy, we're -- we probably were averaging for the quarter about 37 million hits, which is up substantially year-over-year, and even up over the quarter, probably by about 3 million, 2 million to 3 million hits, which tells me, look, we've got a lot of folks that are out there and they're interested in their window shopping, and some of those are absolutely repeat offenders. It's, those aren't unique, visits. As far as where they're going, look, I think there's a lot of folks unless, they just, their car isn't running anymore. They're just delaying the purchase. I do think that for some of the folks that cannot delay the purchase, I absolutely think that some of them are going down to a different level of car just to make sure that they can afford the monthly payments and to have reliable transportation. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, and I'll tack onto that, John. I think, and that's one of the real values of our finance product. You can easily apply online and then providing the answers back on all the vehicles, you again can very easily pivot and find something in your range, sort, filter accordingly. So I think that's one of the things that we're real excited about being able to provide that to our customer. Bill Nash : Well, and the fact that having so many lenders on the platform basically competing for the customers also gives them the best interest rate, which is a key component of the monthly payment. John Healy : Great. Thanks guys. Bill Nash : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I think on the call you commented Bill that comps improved by month, but I think comparison challenges eased, if I'm not mistaken. So what would the monthly cadence look like on a two or three-year stack basis? And then kind of related to that, I know you guys don't guide, haven\u2019t for a very long time, but any reason to believe comps shouldn't turn positive in the back half, just based on current trends and comparisons? Bill Nash : Yes, Scot, if we look at the quarter specifically, I think I talked about the last call at the beginning of the quarter we're starting out how the last quarter ended on average. And we did, as I said in the call, we did see improvement each month of the quarter and September so far is very similar to similar with a little bit of improvement to where August was. We're not going to give guidance on the rest of the year, but as you said, I mean the comps do because of last year's performance, the comps do get a little bit easier. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. So if I were just to break down 2Q, you're not commenting on 3Q obviously, if I was looking at stacks, like is there a way to kind of look at on a two or three-year stack and help us understand whether there was improvement on that basis? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Well, the two-year stack in the second quarter was better than the first quarter. So I think when it comes to intra quarter, we try not to talk too much about the details of month-to-month especially when looking over year, but I would tell you that second quarter, two-year basis better than the first quarter, as like Bill said. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, I'll take the rest offline. Thanks guys. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I apologize if you answered this, my cell cut out and I had to redial in. But obviously you're resuming the share repurchase program. What are the thoughts at this point on store openings? I don't know if you even reiterated the plan for this year and I know you had kind of left the door open and maybe accelerating next year. So just thoughts on that or if perhaps the idea has changed in terms of harvesting more sales at existing locations rather than growing the store base meaningfully? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, Sharon. Yes, our outlook at this point, what we've already said hasn't changed. So this year we have a few more stores that we're going to open up, so that will get us to a total of five this year, plus the one standalone production facility that we've talked about down in the Atlanta market. We have not come out and said exactly the number of stores that we'll be building next year yet. We'll talk about that later on in the year, probably Q4 and let you know. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes and that's regular routine. We provide that update on an annual basis along with our CapEx guidance for the year. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, thanks. Bill Nash : Thanks, Sharon. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the credit front, if you can provide an update on credit availability? And then also to the extent some of the credit behavior was less favorable, how should we think about provisioning, given the current background is kind of $90 million the right number for now? Any color you can give there would be great. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, I'll take them in order. So, credit availability for CarMax again, I think this is one of the values of having the multitude of lenders that we have. We really continue to provide our customers with great access to credit. Now, I think it's not surprised in the industry that obviously lenders are always looking to shore up their portfolios and they've tightened where they've needed to. We've seen most of our tightening from our partners if you will, probably the back half of last calendar year. CAF has tightened over the course of the year and I think that's just standard lending practices that you're going to find right now. But ultimately I think we provide fantastic access to credit certainly in the high 90% range from a mid to over and probably 95% approval rate to customers when they apply. And again, I think we give them access, to see other vehicles that are available to them. Regarding overall performance in the quarter for CAF in particular, we continue to look at our overall portfolio. I'm going to look at this from the lens of our Tier 1 business. We securitize everything. We report on that on a monthly basis, how that's performing. If you really look at the older deals that you might compare the newer deals to the 2017, the 2018, the 2019, even the 2020 deals, exceptionally low loss rates, well below the 2% to 2.5% range they're trending towards right now and obviously for all the reasons that we've cited before, access to cash, government stimulus, all that, so they really outperformed. What we're seeing currently in the newer vintages is really highly expected. It's just a reversion back to sort of the normalized levels that the industry has seen from a lending perspective. So we are -- we were anticipating the 2021 to 2022 deals to go back to that 2% to 2.5% range. I would tell you we're seeing with these higher monthly payments we're probably at the higher portion of that range and that's why we've done the tightening that we've done. We've done it over the course of the last year to some degree in Tier 3, and also pockets in Tier 1 where we see opportunity to pull back. We want to make sure we operate well within that 2% to 2.5% range and I think we've done a nice job there. So ultimately, as you think about the provision going forward, it's a combination of several things I cited in the prepared remarks. The existing portfolio, which again yes, I think we have a good handle on, I think it's going to operate in that 2% to 2.5% range and we've done a nice job there. You've got the new originations, which are certainly going to come in lower, given the tightening. We've pulled back to some degree on the Tier 3. It's a small portion of our business and the Tier 2, we're excited about that space and we see great opportunity. So if you put all that together I think our reserve speaks for itself. We've come from a 311 to a 308. I think it's relatively stable. We think we're well reserved and we'll see how the consumer performs, but I think we're in a good spot right now. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask Bill, as you go through periods of steep depreciation, like you're talking about, and we've seen in the used car market on pricing, typically they're accompanied by supply increases, which would drive same-store sales higher. I'm just curious what you're seeing, in the market right now as far as availability and flow of vehicles, maybe in the 0 to 6 year old bucket, which is the target, and then maybe in the 6 to 10 year old, which is a growing target for you over time? Bill Nash : Yes, good morning, John. When I think -- look back at the depreciation for the quarter, like I said, there was steep depreciation in June and July and quite honestly it started in May. So if you look at May, June and July, there was probably about $3,000 of depreciation, which is absolutely it's steep. And the biggest impact it has on us obviously is really more on the buys, because we're going to adjust accordingly and consumers are always thinking that their vehicles are worth more, so it impacts the buys early on until the rest of the market shifts. So from a buy standpoint, it's a headwind in the short-term. But again, I think the team did a phenomenal job not only maintaining the retail margins, but the wholesale margins, which we haven't talked about because year-over-year they were up even in this steep environment. As far as availability, look, if you're having to rely on outside sources, there's just, it's a, there's a limited supply. And if I think back over at least my tenure here at CarMax, there's just less vehicles available through third party auctions and it's been that way for a while. So, and I don't foresee that changing greatly in the near-term, which is also why we're thrilled to have our self-sufficiency so high and we're continuing to look for avenues to continue to source inventory really retail or wholesale, however we can outside of those sources. John Murphy : And maybe just a followup, I mean, do you think you could ever get meaningfully above that 70% self-sufficiency that you're at right now, which is pretty damn good to start with, but I mean, are there other avenues maybe through Edmunds or other ways that you could increase that meaningfully? Bill Nash : Yes, look we could take it to a 100% tomorrow. It's all depends on what you put on the vehicles. I think, we probably, I say this, we probably would never get to a 100% self-sufficiency because You're always going to want to have little pockets of inventory that you're going to want to supplement or whatever. But again, our goal is to drive as much as -- drive it as high as possible. It's been pretty steady in that 70-ish, in that range which we feel we feel good about. And again, I think the key thing here is, it's not only on the retail cars, but we'll also buy every wholesale car as well, so we're absolutely focused on that. John Murphy : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Hope you could elaborate more on compensation expense. I know you said you're lapping cost cuts, but it seems like that compensation cost cuts have sequentially ramped each quarter. So my question is like, if you look at the full year CAGR that's got in particularly better relative to units particularly Q2 versus Q1, are you still actively reducing headcount if unit trends maintain normal seasonality from here what would happen to compensation? Would that also behave normal or would that be better or worse than normal seasonality? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, at this point with compensation, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have pretty much anniversaried over the benefits of some of the stronger levers we put in place. So when thinking of compensation that I would think of that for the back half of the year one or more pressured clients, if you will, relative to what we've been here for the past couple quarters. So we've copped over those levers. At the same time, we go through the decision process at this time of year about staffing for tax time, right? And depending on what the expectation is for tax time, we start to ramp up our associate level there as well. So I do expect compensation will be one of the line items moving forward that will be a little bit more pressured relative to what we've been for the past few quarters here. Jon Daniels : Yes, Chris, and just to bring it to home with some numbers, if you look at a year ago staffing wise, total company we're down about 3000 or so associates and that's pretty consistent with what the first quarter was as well. So we've kind of, as long as we're keeping staffing to where we feel like we need sales to Enrique's point, it will be, the back half of the year will just be you, you won't see as much pickup there. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, which we believe we're appropriately staffed. So those cost management efforts we undertook successfully at this point we're largely successfully staffed and appropriately staffed and so\u2026 Jon Daniels : Yes, the only other thing would be that, and Enrique touched on this in his earlier remarks for everyone to keep in mind is as the back half of the year progresses, that's generally from a seasonality standpoint when we start to think about next year's tax time and building for that and so that generally requires a little bit larger headcount. So we'll be monitoring that as we go through the back half. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That makes sense. And then just quickly on car buying, I think you called that out, it seemed like it was July and August when pricing was the worst, or sorry, June and July, as pricing kind of stabilized a bit in September and lesser extent August, have you seen, are you buying cars more often or more frequently higher conversion from customers, has that kind of trend maintained its pace? Bill Nash : Yes, so June and July were the worst. August actually was up a little bit and then September [indiscernible] data is probably flattish to a little bit up from a depreciation standpoint or in appreciation standpoint. So I would call August and September fairly similar, but it was a reversal of the steep depreciation. And I think as we look forward to the rest of the year, I think what we'll probably see now, this is assuming no other macro factors and obviously there's a lot of things out there, especially when you start thinking about the strike, but outside of that, I would think, we would continue to see probably more normal seasonal depreciation barring any other new event. Chris Bottiglieri : And that helps your car buying, like you expect that to pick back up from here or is that, or do you think it's like the level? Bill Nash : Well, I think what that does is it does a couple of things. One, as depreciation continues, obviously that feeds out onto your front lot prices, so I think that helps some on the affordability issue. I think also more stable depreciation. It just makes it easier to run the business. We do a phenomenal job and the team did a phenomenal job even with that steep depreciation that we saw in the quarter, but when you're starting to see normal depreciation, that's just, that's kind of business as usual for us. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you for the help. I appreciate it. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one question, one clarification. On retail GPU it was a little larger than seasonal decline in the second quarter versus first quarter, last 10 plus years, the average sequential move has been $50 lower. I mean this quarter was more than a 100. Just curious if there were any one-time items that impacted that or were there any pricing tests, anything you would call out? And one clarification. Bill Nash : Yes. Thanks for the question, Rajat. Yes, when I think about this quarter, actually, I'm pleased. I'm pleased because we talked about last quarter coming in to more in line with where we were last year, which remember last year was a record high for us and as you pointed out, I mean, $30 is within the, in the noise for us. So, I feel good about that, especially considering the environment, that's out there. I think, the first quarter obviously was a record high, and I think there was some dynamics in that quarter where you purchased the vehicles and then we saw some appreciation in that quarter, which keeps you from having to do markdowns, that kind of thing. So I look at the first quarter as more of an anomaly, which is why we set the, said what we did last quarter. We thought we'd be more in line in the second quarter with the second quarter last year. And we reiterate, we think we'll be more in line for the whole year with the whole year of last year, which is still a step up from where we've historically run of $80 to a $100. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And Rajat, just as a reminder, the first quarter, there's some seasonality benefit too, right? So the first quarter tends to be our strongest from a GPU standpoint, just within tax time, so that happening as well? Rajat Gupta : Right, right. Yes, that's helpful. And just you mentioned earlier around the supply situation and the fact that there are several cars in the 0 to 10 year old that may not meet your reconditioning needs. As we look into later this year, into the next couple years, it looks like, you're building more dependency on the greater than 6 year old cars to grow your business. Yes, how do you get around some of those quality constraints, reconditioning constraints for those cars, because the 0 to 4 year old supply is likely going to get worse before it gets better. So how do we manage through that to return to growth in the business in the next couple of years? Thanks. Jon Daniels : Yes. Well what I would remind you Rajat is if you go back when we had the last big bubble go through on late model cars, back in the financial crisis, the new car sales rate in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, it bounced around anywhere between $10.5 million and a little over $13 million. If you look at the period from like 2020, 2021, 2022, and even the estimate for this year, you're talking about 2014 to over 2015. So, my point in pointing that out is, we've been through far worse situations than what we're seeing now as far as a bubble of 0 to 4 or 0 to 6 year old cars that we're going to be facing. And again, we're in a better position than we were back then because our self-sufficiency is so high and we're getting those cars directly from consumers and other sources. So we feel very good about our ability to navigate the future, whether it's consumers wanting 0 to 6 year old cars or whether it's consumers wanting to buy something a little bit older. Rajat Gupta : Understood, that's helpful color. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning guys. Bill Nash : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to ask a followup on CAF, and maybe it ties into the affordability discussion, but the weighted average rate here was flat, I think sequentially at 11.1% despite maybe rising benchmark rates and your recent trend of passing through price. So, I guess, are we seeing customers push back on rates? Should we maybe take that as a sign customers have reached their limit on affordability and are you guys at maybe the end of your ability to pass through more APR at CAF despite the rising kind of rate environment? Just curious, why that's sequentially flat line from here? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes, great question Daniel. A couple of things that are subtle in there to point out. First, the flat quarter-over-quarter also realize we did some tightening in there. If you pull back in the Tier 3 space, we pick pockets in the Tier 1 space, that's going to offset any sequential growth in the APR. I can tell you that we did continue to test and raise APRs within the quarter, but bear in mind, I think one of the key things for us is, we're not looking to maximize finance margin. When we do our testing and pass this along to the customer, we're taking into accounts, are they able to purchase the car? Are they going to end up paying off with someone else where we wouldn't gain any finance income? So we very carefully test different rates and then adjust those rates in smaller pockets to optimize the overall CarMax value. So I think that's why you're seeing the sequential piece. But certainly, obviously there are payment pressures as Bill mentioned, so we continue to be very careful with that. But that's why you're seeing sequential quarter-over-quarter flat. It's -- the tightening is offsetting it. Daniel Imbro : So to followup that question, your strategy would more be to maximize units sold, not maximize margins at CAF, did we hear that right? Jon Daniels : No. I would say we contemplate that in the decision. We look at units sold, we look at amount of finance margin that CAF captures and also contemplate, remember they can pay off in three days. So we could sell the car, but CAF could lose the financing if they choose to go down the street to their bank or their credit union. So we put all that together to optimize for CarMax in total, not just maximize one dimension or the other. That's CarMax's total profitability, right? How we think about it. That's right. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question will come from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just sticking with those other financing channels you just mentioned Enrique, I'm just curious why this year other is gaining a lot at the expense of Tier 2? Are there just more cash only buyers in the market now or is there a problem with Tier 2 consumers willing to buy or are other lenders just taking the opportunity from you? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Sure. Yes, David. I think there's a couple things going on there. First I think what you really do see is the affordability is definitely a challenge in the bottom portion of the credit spectrum, kind of that mid-tier to the subprime space. We see great demand across the credit spectrum, but ultimately when they see the monthly payment it's the higher end guys that are able to follow through with the purchase. So that's going to benefit both cash and kind of the outside financing population. You did see some pullback, as I mentioned the back half of last year in the Tier 2 space, so there's also some tightening that's hurting the penetration there just around it out in Tier 3, they did benefit from that tightening, right. Those customers flow down to the Tier 3 space. But I think it predominantly is, it's affordability. Those higher end customers can buy and that's why you see the percentage of sales are a little more skewed to the high end. I think there's demand everywhere, but that's really what's driving it. David Whiston : Okay. And could you just briefly give me some examples of what non-CAF uncollectable receivables are? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, so those are going to be, so this hits in the SG&A bucket, right? And these are going to be receivables that our finance partners originate and underwrite that end up having a title processing issue or a down payment challenge that we end up having to buy back. So that's an area of focus for us. Over the past year, we've made material improvements, as I've talked about on previous quarters, both in execution in our stores, in our home office. The DMVs have also got better in terms of turning around those titles as well as the banks in terms of turning around the processing. So, we saw another quarter of benefit this quarter, we expect to see some more benefit in the back half of the year. Probably not as strong as the first half of the year as we start to lap over that accentuated focus last year that we had on making sure we're managing those. David Whiston : And I'm sorry; do you do a 100% of that servicing for the third party lenders in terms of the collection stuff? Enrique Mayor-Mora: No, we do not. That's, we do not underwrite it. That's the third party partners that would underwrite it and then service it. That's right. David Whiston : All right. Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Montani : Hey guys, thanks for letting me sneak one more in. I just wanted to ask about, if you could give any incremental color around the sales trends by income level and when you think about the improvements sequentially to the down 9 comp and then throughout the quarter, what are you seeing for upper income versus lower income consumers? And then how does that filter into your desire to spend into ad dollars for the back half of the year? Bill Nash : Okay. Yes, so as I said earlier, I mean, we're seeing the biggest pinch probably on the, not probably on the, we are seeing it on the lower consumer. And think about it, from a monthly household income of let's say $3000 to $4,000 that had, that segment of sales for us has shrunk dramatically. So it's probably in the last couple of years it's down probably and it's probably down about 50% in the $3,000 and less household incomes about 50% less than what it used to be. So that's absolutely a headwind, which again speaks to the affordability. As far as advertising goes, that's an area where Jim and Sarah and team, they constantly are looking at it. And I think an interesting thing that everybody needs to keep in mind is, because we've got this big buying engine also, when we talk about advertising, it's advertising for sales, but it's also advertising for buy. So while you may pull back on sales, you may do more on buy. So it's a walk that we do, and that team does a great job measuring the ROI. So to Enrique's comments earlier, what we're expecting to do in the back half, that certainly could shift if we see something in the marketplace that says, hey you don't need to spend as much, it's not fruitful or on the flip side, hey you may want to spend a little bit more and so we're constantly monitoring that. But I think the guidance that Enrique gave is really the way to think about it and then we'll continue to monitor it. Michael Montani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We don't have any further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Well, I thank you all for joining the call today and for your questions and your continued support. I do want to one more time congratulate the CarMax team on achieving our 30th anniversary and I just want to thank them for everything that they do every day to take care of each other and our customers and the communities and we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the second quarter fiscal year 2024 CarMax earnings release conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of our strategy that has yielded sequential year-over-year improvements across key components of our business for four straight quarters. While affordability of used car remains a challenge for consumers, we're excited about the positive impact we are seeing from our omnichannel investments, which reinforces our strong belief that we are well positioned for the future. This quarter, we delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs. We bought more vehicles from consumers and dealers, and we also sold more wholesale units than a year ago. We further reduced SG&A from the prior year. We continued to strengthen the credit mix within NCAP's receivables portfolio, which had a positive impact on our loan loss provision, and we resumed our share repurchase program. For the third quarter of FY '24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $6.1 billion, down 5% compared to last year. This was driven by lower retail and wholesale prices and lower retail volume partially offset by higher wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 2.9% and used unit comps were down 4.1%. Average selling price declined approximately $1,300 per unit or 5% year-over-year. Third quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,277, relatively consistent with $2,237 from last year. For the fourth quarter, our expectation is that our margin -- our per unit margin will be lower than last year's fourth quarter record margin. We continue to expect that per unit margin for the full year will be similar to last year. As always, we will continue to actively manage this as we test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape. Wholesale unit sales were up 7.7% versus the third quarter last year. Average selling price declined approximately $600 per unit or 7% year-over-year. Third quarter wholesale gross profit per unit was $961 in line with $966 a year ago. Like our outlook on retail GPU, we anticipate wholesale per unit margin for the full year will be similar to last year. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter wholesale GPU was within $4 of our all-time record and benefited from appreciation and strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of the quarter. We expect this year's fourth quarter per unit margin will be more in line with our year-to-date performance and lower than last year. We bought approximately 250,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, up 5% from last year. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately $228,000 from consumers with slightly more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. As a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% for the quarter. With the support of our Edmond sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 22,000 vehicles through dealers, up from approximately 14,000 last year. In regard to our third quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 12% last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter up from 52% in the prior year. All of our third quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions. This represents 19% of total revenue. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 31%, up from 28% last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $149 million down slightly from $152 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contribution in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across our business and our P&L. Notable areas of improvement included used in wholesale unit sales and their respective margin dollars, total gross profit, CAF contribution, SG&A leverage and EPS. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.52 versus $0.24 a year ago. Total gross profit was $613 million, up 6% from last year's third quarter. Used retail margin declined by 1% to $398 million with lower volume, partially offset by a slightly higher per unit margin. Wholesale vehicle margin increased by 7% to $123 million, with an increase in volume and flat per unit margin compared to last year. Other gross profit was $92 million, up 55% from a year ago. This increase was driven by service, which delivered a $33 million improvement over last year with this year's quarter reporting a $21 million loss. The efficiency and cost coverage measures that we put in place towards the end of FY '23 continued to drive improved year-over-year performance in FY '24. Extended protection plan or EPP revenues were relatively flat compared to last year's third quarter. We do not expect to receive profit-sharing revenues in the fourth quarter due to the inflationary pressures our partners have experienced. Third-party finance fees were down $2 million from a year ago, driven by lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee and higher volume in Tier 3 for which we pay a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter were $560 million, down 5% from the prior year's quarter as we continue to see benefits from our cost management efforts. SG&A as a percent of gross profit levered by 11 percentage points as compared to last year. The decrease in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to three factors. First, other overhead decreased by $19 million, this decrease was driven primarily by continued favorability in non-GAAP uncollectible receivables and, to a lesser degree, from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and from favorability in costs associated with lower staffing levels. Second, total compensation and benefits decreased by $20 million, excluding a $3 million increase in share-based compensation. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus on driving efficiency gains and aligning staffing levels in stores and CECs with sales. The decrease was also impacted by a lower corporate bonus accrual in the quarter. Third, advertising increased by $5 million. This reflects an increase in per unit spend as compared to last year's quarterly low level of per unit spend and was partially offset by lower units. As we have previously communicated, our expectation is for our full year marketing spend on a per unit basis to be similar to last year. Accordingly, we expect that our per unit spend in this year's fourth quarter will exceed last year's fourth quarter. Entering the fourth quarter, we have now passed the year mark since we initiated our significant cost management efforts. We are well on track to outperform the target we set out at the beginning of the year of requiring low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full year, even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlements. That being said, we remain disciplined with our spend and investment levels. Regarding capital structure, we resumed our share repurchase program in October. Repurchasing approximately 649,000 shares for a total spend of $42 million in the quarter. This pace is in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.41 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. In terms of other uses of capital, such as new store openings, we will open four stores in the fourth quarter including two in the New York metro market and one in each of the Los Angeles and Chicago metro markets. We will also open our first stand-alone reconditioning center in the Atlanta metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $2 billion, resulting in penetration of 44% net of three-day payoffs, which was up from Q2 and relatively in line with the 44.4% observed during the third quarter last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from the same period last year and up 20 basis points from Q2. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was sequentially in line with Q2 at 18%, but remains lower year-over-year as we have yet to fully comp over the partner tightening observed in the back half of calendar 2022. Tier 3 accounted for 6.9% of sales as compared to 6.1% last year, impacting each of these results as CAF's decreased percentage in Tier 3 as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $149 million, down $3.5 million from the same period last year, but up $14 million sequentially. The provision for the quarter was $68.3 million as compared to $85.7 million in the prior year's Q3. The $17 million favorability was offset by a year-over-year reduction in total interest margin of $20 million, driven by additional interest expense of $81 million. Note fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $6 million in expense this year versus $5 million of income last year. The total interest margin of the portfolio decreased to 5.9% from the 6.1% seen last quarter. This slight reduction is primarily a result of increased funding costs, including the fair market value adjustments along with CAF's deliberate credit tightening that began last year, which inherently removes higher margin, higher loss assets from new originations. CAF continued to offset these headwinds by adjusting customer rates but with a careful eye on three-day payoffs, sales and overall CarMax profitability. We are pleased with our ability to maintain a relatively stable net interest margin despite the volatile interest rate environment. The $68 million provision within the quarter resulted in a reserve balance of $512 million or 2.92% of receivables compared to 3.08% at the end of the second quarter. This 16 basis point reduction has occurred even with CAF's continued investment in the Tier 2 space and is evidence of the growing impact that our broader credit tightening is having on the overall portfolio. While CAF delinquency levels remain elevated versus historic norms, as has been the case industry-wide, we believe our reserve adjustment adequately reflects the anticipated future loss performance of our portfolio. The underwriting adjustments executed to date have been the right strategic moves to ensure we hit targeted loss levels, preserve our access to efficient funding yet still deliver strong future CAF earnings. We are well poised to recapture Tier 1 and Tier 3 volume as economic conditions improve and our continued learning in the Tier 2 space should provide a future growth opportunity. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're excited about the contributions we are seeing from our omnichannel investments. Our omnichannel capabilities offer our customers a uniquely personalized car buying experience that enables them to do as much or as little online and in-stores they want. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry. As we have said before, we believe consumers in the used car industry will increasingly prefer to have the ability to progress digitally. We are seeing this in our data. At the end of fiscal year '20 when we completed our initial omnichannel rollout, approximately 40% of our customers leverage some or all of our digital capabilities to complete their transactions. That has grown to approximately 70% this year. I recognize that the market volatility over the past few years has made it challenging to see the direct benefits omnichannel has delivered to our business, so I want to share some proof points that we are seeing. First, our data indicates that omnichannel is driving incremental retail customers to CarMax. Customers who fully complete an online transaction are 10% more likely to be new to CarMax compared with our omnichannel and in-store customers. We have also found that our online consumers skew younger, which creates the opportunity to participate in more of their lifetime purchase cycles. Additionally, since initially completing our omnichannel rollout, we have seen outsized market share growth in our oldest 15 markets where we have not opened new stores since calendar 2013. In calendar 2019, the market share annual growth rate for these markets doubled from the average annual growth rate for the previous five years. Moreover, from the beginning of calendar 2019 to the end of calendar '22, the market share average annual growth rate for these older markets continue to exceed their pre omnichannel average growth rate. Second, instant offer, our online consumer-facing appraisal tool that is a core part of our omnichannel capabilities is significantly driving our vehicle purchases and wholesale sales. We doubled our bots from consumers of the year we launched instant offer. This enabled us to grow our self-sufficiency to over 70%, which we have maintained since we launched the tool. Online buyouts have also fueled our wholesale volume, which grew approximately 65% during the launch year and has remained well above the volume prior to instant offer. It's worth noting that our instant offer algorithms also support our dealer-facing Max offer vehicle sourcing application. Third, our omnichannel products are supporting double-digit web traffic growth. Finance based shopping has been our number one lead source. This multi-lender prequalification products gives customers the ability to digitally receive quick credit decisions across our inventory with no impact to their credit score. Over 80% of our customers are using this online tool as they begin the credit process. Finally, omnichannel is on track to be a more efficient cost structure compared to our store-only model. Our omnichannel cost structure has more fixed costs than our historical store-only structure. We continue to show sequential year-over-year improvements in key cost efficiency metrics for omnichannel overhead model. With a more fixed cost structure, we expect to lever more strongly than in the previous model as demand picks up. We expect the impact of our omnichannel capabilities will continue to grow over time as consumers demand a more personalized experience that combines online and in-store progression. We believe that many of our competitors across the used car industry will not be able to deliver this experience in a simple and seamless manner. In closing, we're confident we have the right strategy in place. Our consistent approach to control what we can and deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry is driving sequential quarterly improvements across our business. We are well positioned to emerge from this cycle an even stronger company. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first with Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Jon, Enrique, maybe just want to circle back on the cash provision just given the impressive results here. I'm trying to understand the puts and takes. So, the allowance came down quite a bit, Jon, I think you talked about maybe just tighter underwriting there. But it looks like net charge-offs are at maybe the highest level we've seen in over a decade. So, I guess how can you -- can you help us reconcile those two factors? And how should we think about provisions has the credit improvement meant that nominally this is the right level of provisions going forward? Or how would you think about those trends as we move through the end of the year and the tax refund season? Jon Daniels : Yes, Dan, absolutely appreciate the question and fully expected it. So first, let's start on the provision piece. Our provision in the quarter is going to be made up of two components. It's going to be our change in outlook on the losses that we expect on the existing book of business versus what we set at the end of Q2. Second, it's going to be the required reserve on losses on the new originations. So let's touch on the first piece. What I can tell you is if you look at our expectation at the beginning of Q2 and what we observed on that existing book of business over the course of Q3, there hasn't been a lot of change. Let's talk about the actuals and what we have observed because you referenced that. We publish on a monthly basis, our securitizations and how they're performing. It's important to note that that's about 60% of our receivables. We have a lot of stuff that has not yet been securitized. We've also mentioned that's been tighter. But what you see out there in the securitizations, we certainly observed two separate books of business there. The pre-COVID and the early COVID stuff that came in markedly lower than our target, well below the 2% to 2.5%. We knew that was going to come back into more normalized levels, and that's what we're seeing on the new stuff. We've also said that we believe there's front-loading occurring. If you look at those newer securitizations, especially in like the '21, 3, the '21, 4, the early '22 stuff, there is a clear curve difference in when the losses come in. We think its front loaded. All of that was contemplated when we set a reserve at the end of Q2. So largely, this first component of the provision did not -- there wasn't a major adjustment that we had to make, which means at the end of the day, our provision is primarily made up of our new originations, and we talked about this. Our new originations are significantly tighter. There's very limited Tier 3 volume, there's a test amount in Tier 2. And then our Tier 1 stuff, we've even been tightened there. So on that roughly $2 billion. It's a tighter book of business. It's a lower amount of overall loss. It's a relatively modest required provision, and that is the bulk of the Q3 provision. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : You're asking a nice continued solid progression here. Bill Nash : Thank you. Brian Nagel : My question, I guess, just looking first at the wholesale business, that definitely inflected stronger here in the fiscal third quarter. I guess the question I would have is explain more kind of what was behind that inflection in sales growth? And are there reasons -- as you look at the wholesale business or the read-through over to your used car business, just given the natural kind of association with those two segments. And then just a quick follow-up. Any commentary I mean given what we saw here in Q3, any commentary how the quarter progressed and what we're seeing into early Q4? Bill Nash : Yes. Great. Thank you for the questions, Brian. So yes, we are pleased with the wholesale growth. I think it's a combination of factors. I think one, there's a little bit of year-over-year dynamics playing in last year, given where we were, given where we saw sales, things that were going on in the marketplace, we actually pulled back on our offers. So I think you've got a little bit of that reflecting in kind of the year-over-year growth. But I also feel really good about the innovation on the product side of things. So when you think about Max offer, one of the things with Max offer, we completed this quarter the rollout of our instant offer component of it. We still had a few markets that did not have instant offer, which meant they had to take pictures of vehicles and then get a value. Now they have the option to just not take pictures, if they want to take pictures, they still can. So that's some of the innovation there that I think that helps. So we feel really great about the innovation. And as we go forward, it will probably be dependent more on what's going on in the market dynamics, that kind of thing at any given time. As far as kind of the quarter and just outlook -- look, obviously, the industry is still challenged, and everybody knows that. And obviously, our business isn't where we want it to be. But I do think there's some encouraging signs out there. I mean besides the fact that we have continued to have sequential improvements we saw a lot of depreciation this quarter, really steep depreciation. And while that causes some headwinds on in the near term, and it's going to cause some headwinds just in wholesale a little bit and even on the retail side. It's a short-term thing, and I think it benefits the overall used car industry, and it will benefit us because that will continue to come out on front-lit prices. You saw we're about $1,300 down this year, year-over-year on sales prices. From an acquisition standpoint, it was more like $1,500, but we had some mix adjustment stuff in there. So again, I think the steep depreciation is good. Interest rates if they at least stabilize, I think that's great. I think it's great for the business. I think that will help. And if they come down, I think that will be kind of extra icing on the cake. Another thing that I would point to is our market share. October, which is the latest period that we've gotten market share data on is the first month that we've actually comped our market share year-over-year. So I think that's encouraging. And then the other thing I would tell you is -- we've talked before about just comps and where the sales might be going. And we've done some analysis with one of the credit bureaus just trying to understand of the customers that apply for a loan through CAF, where do they go? And it seems like from the analysis we've done, there's a lot of customers that just once they decide they're not buying, they're not buying. So it's almost like there's a -- maybe hopefully, there's some pent-up demand that I think we'll see as the market comes back. So again, I think while there's some signs of encouragement, yes, the industry is still challenged. We're encouraged by that. And I think taking all that into consideration, also just bearing in mind, this whole time we've been working on cost control, becoming more efficient, having better experiences for our customers and our associates. I think all that plays well to into the future. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : We'll turn now to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My question is also on CAF. Jon, could you give us some more color on those securitizations from late '21 through 2022 in terms of your expectations that the loss curves are going to flatten out because we haven't really seen that in the data yet. Jon Daniels : Yes. I appreciate the question. Yes, I think the key thing to point to here is if you look at -- obviously, what's published out there right now is I think the 2019 stuff going forward. If you pull back and you look at sort of the 2016, '17, '18 stuff that I think is -- you probably have access to stuff. And you look at the typical shape of that curve, what we absolutely are seeing is the '21, 3 the '21, 4, looks like it's turning over. Now everybody is going to trend it their own way. But when we look at that and you look at the timing of loss, we absolutely see these things coming in certainly within our targeted range. The \u201822, 1 and the \u201822, 2 we're watching very closely, looks like that's beginning to turn over. Admittedly, the \u201822, 3, \u201822, 4 earlier in the life have not yet turned over, and so we're watching that very carefully. But neither had those previous ones I mentioned at the point at which they exist. So all of this, when we trended out, we know the sub-segments that are in there, we know how they perform and how early the loss comes. We absolutely believe all of this is coming in, in the 2% to 2.5% range, which is truly our target. So does that give you the color you need, Seth, anything further on that? Seth Basham : That's helpful. Of the securitizations you have outstanding, are you forecasting losses for any of them above that 2% to 2.5% range? Jon Daniels : For those -- for the securitizations we have today because, again, we have the luxury of breaking that down by sub-segment by different pockets. And we right now do not see anything above the 2.5%. Again, that's -- and again, that's a target. Yes. Not saying the inning is going to come above there. If something came up at 2.5%, 2.55% at the end of the day, we will reserve for it accordingly. It will be what it is. But no, right now, we do not see that. And I think the only other point I'll make is, again, this is what has been securitized to-date. Bear in mind, and I think you're well aware of this, Seth. It's four, five, six months before it ends up in a bulk of our tightening has absolutely occurred over the last year. So I fully expect as that stuff hits the market, you're going to see clearly the evidence of the tightening that we have done over the last year. Enrique Mayor-Mora: As Jon had mentioned, a lot of the receivables that we don't see are in our warehouses, right? It's about, what, 60% roughly of what you'll see, are in the securitization data that's public, but there's a good chunk of receivables that are not necessarily public because they're an warehouses there in alternative facilities. And that's really where you see a lot of that tightening. That's blending into the overall loss rate. Operator : We'll go next to Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : I had a question on AI. At your Analyst Day a few months ago, you highlighted several ways in which your tech team was driving innovation. I guess I'm wondering, very big picture, whether you see AI as a technology that is going to level the playing field for other used car retailers or rather might be a wedge technology that really does ultimately separate winners from losers. Bill Nash : Yes. Well, thank you for the question, Craig. Well, first of all, I think we kind of have to separate AI versus generative AI because AI has been around a long time. We've been leveraging it for a long time in a lot of different aspects of the business. And when we talked about it most recently at the day that you're referring, it was really more generative AI. And I think at some point, folks will be embracing generative AI. I think the early adopters are the ones that get the benefit in the near term. And as you referenced, I mean, we're leveraging in a lot of different spots. We're leveraging in our creative. We're leveraging it in our coding. We're working on some generative AI assistance on a knowledge base for our CECs, which we think is going to be really powerful. We're leveraging it on a conversational search. We've got some tests going on right now where instead of typing in key search things, we can actually do conversational search with consumers. So again, I don't -- I think it's one of those things that's kind of going to be at the end of the day, you just need to have it. And if you don't, you're going to be at a disadvantage. So, I think those that embrace it earlier actually get an early benefit of embracing it. Operator : We'll turn now to Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Rajat Gupta : I had a follow-up question on CAF around net interest margin. Should we look at that 5.9% as a loan exposure and stable around that level going forward? I just wanted to clarify that and just have one quick follow-up on SG&A. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes. I appreciate the question, Rajat. Yes, I think that's a fair thought, right? I mean we signaled a couple of quarters ago that we felt like that 6% range was about where we're going to level off. Remember, we're coming off of relatively historic high. So, we've been pleased that our ability to pass this rate along to the customer. Obviously, there was a shock in the interest rate market. So said it was coming, those higher interest rates were coming and it clearly has helped us to level off. So, we're pleased where we sit right now. And I think we would anticipate stabilizing at this level. Obviously, all bets are off with where the Fed heads, hopefully, rates aren't going up. If they remain stable, we think we're in a good spot. If they come down and turn down as a reminder, typically rate increases lag when rates go up and rate decreases lag when rates come down. So hopefully, potentially, we could enjoy some added margin on the way down. But right now, I think we're in a stable spot. Bill Nash : Yes, Rajat, I just would add. Look, I think Jon has done a good job of kind of saying, look, we expect to be in this range. We said we were 6, 1 in the last couple of quarters, give us a little wiggle room depending on what the cost of funds in here, it's down a little bit, but it's really reflected the cost of funds. So I think the way we think about it is it's really no change in story, as Jon said. Rajat Gupta : Understood. And just on SG&A, I mean, it looks like there are some continued actions you are taking there on the head count side. Can you give us a sense of what areas are these taking place at? Is it the CECs, or salespeople or Edmond? And any -- and is this an indication of your view on the market backdrop in any way in the near to medium term? And relatedly, could you quantify how much the impact was from the bonus accruals this quarter as well? Enrique Mayor-Mora: That was a multi-pronged question there for that. If I miss one, just... Rajat Gupta : Sorry. Enrique Mayor-Mora: If I miss one, just remind what the question was in terms of where the reductions have been when it comes to compensation, which I think was your first question. It's really been across the board. We've had -- compared to last year, almost a 10% decrease in our head count when it comes to SG&A. And that's been across the board in our CECs. It's been in the business office and the stores and the field sales consultants down as well. So what you're really looking at is tight control of our overhead in compensation, better metric to sales, but also really driving efficiency. We continue to see quarter-over-quarter year-over-year improvements in the efficiency of the omni model. And we've talked about that on two of the three metrics that we track in terms of the impact of omni on total units, so used plus wholesale were more efficient than we used to be at this point. When you look at as a percent of total gross profit, we're more efficient than we used to be versus when we launched omni. And one indicator, we're still not as efficient, but we're working our way there is the omni operating model as compared on a per retail unit basis. Our goal is to be more efficient, but we're not quite there yet. So we feel really good about the progress we're making. And what that really does, that focus on efficiency positions us really well for when sales rebound and they will. And when they do, we do expect to flow through those sales at a stronger clip I think that was one of your questions. Rajat Gupta : The other was like just the continued reductions in any way trying to -- or is it an indication of like the market backdrop in any way? Is there a view that you're taking on the volume recovery here, over the next few quarters? And then the third part of the question was just what would the -- if you could quantify the impact from the bonus accruals in the third quarter. Bill Nash : Rajat, this is Bill. I'll take the first part. Enrique, you take SG&A. As far as, look, if you look at our staffing, I think for this whole year, we've been fairly stable. Like Enrique said, we're down about 10%, but head count total has been fairly consistent to the last few quarters. And I think we've really put ourselves in a position that we can be very nimble here. So depending on what happens with the business, if the business picks up. We feel really good about where we are from a staffing-wise, we can manage hours that kind of thing. If the business took a downturn for some reason, we also feel like we have some flexibility. So I think we've really kind of given ourselves a nimbleness that we feel good about going forward. And then I'll pass to you. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, but the corporate bonus pace within compensation. So very specifically, that was about $5 million in the quarter in terms of favorability. Operator : We will turn now to Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : So I have a follow-up on the affordability issues. Do you guys think you need to get back to 2019 levels and affordability to get your 2019 volume levels back to -- get back to on a 2019 levels on a per store basis? And then related to that, any insight you guys could provide in 4Q? I think investors have generally been expecting comps to turn positive in 4Q just due to easy comparisons, but I believe some of the third-party data suggest trends might be still negative. I appreciate that. Bill Nash : Yes. Sure, Scott. I think on the first part of your question, you're talking about affordability. And I assume you're talking about the price of cars where it was in 2019 versus where it is today? Am I interpreting the question, right? Scot Ciccarelli : Correct? Bill Nash : Look, I don't think I'd be hard pressed to say that I think we'll get back to the 2019 levels. I do think there's plenty of room -- back 2019, I think average sales price was 20,000. This period, it was a little over 27,000 and I think it's -- we'll get back down hopefully in the low 20s, low 20s or so, maybe mid- like 25 or so, all of those are better than where they are today. And we already see kind of year-over-year where our under $20,000 cars and our under $25,000 cards, we're making progress there. So we think that's a good sign. But do I think they'll get all the way there. I don't think so, partly because just new cars are becoming more and more expensive. So I think the bigger thing there is what does that gap look like in the future? And then as far as comps go, yes, look, I think the market, it's been a little choppy and from a consumer demand standpoint. If I look at the three months of the quarter, it was choppy. I mean, September was our best month, although it was still negative. October was the lowest month, November was similar to October, although it was a little -- it was better than -- November was better than October, although they were similar. And then December is similar to November, although right now, it's a little bit better. So, I think we're continuing to monitor elasticity, doing the things that we need to do. And I'm hopeful that as we see some of this depreciation manifest itself but on the front line. I think that will be good for the industry going forward. Scot Ciccarelli : Bill, I guess my question is on the affordability issue. Like do you need -- how much improvement do you need in affordability to get your volume back on a kind of a per store basis to what you saw in 2019? Bill Nash : Yes. Look, it's a hard question to be able to exactly answer what that needs to be. I think that, again, I think we can get back on to the comp growth without having to get back to 2019. And again, we've seen sequential improvements this year even though the prices haven't come down dramatically from the start of the year. So it's a hard question to answer, Scott. But look, our goal is to get back on to the comp growth. And the reality is if I look at first 10 months of this calendar year, which we have market share data for versus the last six months of last year. We're doing better from a market share standpoint for the first 10 months than we were the last six months of last year, which I think is encouraging. We haven't comped total year-over-year yet because the first half of last year was so strong. But as I said earlier, I'm encouraged by the fact that October is the first month we have month-over-month market share -- a year-over-year market share growth. Operator : We'll go now to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Just wanted to ask, Bill, just your expectations kind of maybe on this year's tax season, it's just around the corner. And what you see as kind of maybe pluses or minuses. I don't know I know we all fixate on kind of the monthly trends, but anything relating to tax season, how you guys are feeling like that might impact this year's business or any kind of other exogenous factors that might go into kind of maybe how we see February or March demand levels kind of materialize? Bill Nash : Yes, I'll tell you, John, if you know, I appreciate a call afterwards, and let's talk about it if you know the answer to that. I don't -- right now, I don't foresee there's nothing I can say that would say, okay, tax season is going to be dramatically different than last year. I mean I think in tax season, you expect to sell more cars, I think it will be similar. I think what's going to be interesting is last year, at the beginning of the calendar year. There was really steep appreciation in vehicles. And I think it will be interesting. We aren't counting on that steep appreciation. So it will be interesting to see the year-over-year dynamics of that from a pricing standpoint. But as we sit here right now, we're kind of planning a tax season that was similar to last year because we don't really see any signs that make it dramatically different. Operator : We'll go now to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I guess a follow-up on that. Have you changed the way you show inventory on the website? Because it does look like there's been a big inventory build so far in the last few months. And if you're not expecting kind of a sea change in the tax refund season, I'm just curious on why we're seeing that inventory build. Bill Nash : Yes, Sharon, that's a great question. And -- what you're seeing there is if you look at the average saleable inventory for the quarter, year-over-year, and the average, it's very similar to last year. If you look at the end of the quarter, to your point, it's up. And the reality is total inventory is up a little bit, and it's up in salable versus non-salable. And the reason it's up in salable is because we're planning some production shutdown. If you remember, last year, the holiday fell on the weekend well we don't build cars on the weekend. This year, it falls on a day, both January, but the first and December 25th fall on weekdays. And we want to give our folks time off and be able to join the holidays. So we actually did a little bit of a pre-build early on to make sure that we took in consideration that we want to have the shops closed and give time off for the holiday. So, it's really -- that's kind of what you're seeing. There is a little bit of year-over-year dynamics as well, but that's the bulk of what you're seeing. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. And any thought process yet on kind of how you're viewing expansion from a unit standpoint for next year? Enrique Mayor-Mora: For new locations? Sharon Zackfia : Yes. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, we'll provide that guidance in we usually provide that guidance in our Q4 call, and that's what we'll intend to do. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Chris Bottiglieri : I was just hoping you could elaborate on the comment on not expecting to see a profit share in ESP. Would you expect F&I in Q4 to be similar to Q3? Is the historical seasonal difference primarily profit share? And then, does that have any spillover effect into next fiscal year, like in terms of how you set the -- I don't know, like anyway, just is there any spillover effect from the lower Q4 profit share? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. The seasonal effect is really more related to sales, right, and as sales map, so ESP penetration in dollars. So the only thing we've seen in the past couple of years is really in the fourth quarter where we've seen that profit share from our partners materialized at the end of the quarter. And last year was pretty material. I think it was over $15 million. And so I wanted to make sure we called that out. Just given the inflationary pressures that our partners have seen over the past year, it's just made their profitability a little bit more pinched. And at the end of the day, when we look for profit share, there needs to be a certain amount that they're seeing for us to have that -- to share in that. So what we've anticipated so far for this year is that we will not see that profit share. But again, that's really due to inflationary pressures that our partners are seeing. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then I was hoping you could kind of elaborate on the warehouse portfolio. It's roughly 2/3 the size of the kind of securitized stuff. Like could you just maybe tell us a little bit more about what's in there? What's the average age today versus the securities portfolio? If you were to look at these like non-securitized non-Tier 2, 3 test receivables, like how does the loss performance of those vintages compared to like the like-for-like vintages that are in the securitized book? It sounds like you're signaling that it's better, but I was hoping you can just kind of elaborate on that a little bit more. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, I'll take that one, Chris. Yes, really, our warehouse lines provide that short-term funding until we take it to an ABS market or we look at other instruments to do a more permanent funding solution there. But our conduit lines right now primarily hold the newest assets until we take them to the market. So you've got -- this quarter stuff is going to sit there. Last quarter stuff is going to sit there. Let's call that $4 billion. There could be some spillover as well. So as we've mentioned, we've done significant tightening certainly from the Tier 3 and Tier 2. But if we isolate the Tier 1, we've tightened in the Tier 1 space. we would absolutely expect those Tier 1 assets to perform better than what's in the securitization. Again, all of it, we think it performs very well. But from a loss perspective, in particular, that conduit stuff is going to be a lower loss than what you're seeing in the most recent securitizations. Enrique Mayor-Mora: The receivables will tend to sit in our warehouses for between three to six, seven months, right, until the time they then go into the securitizations. And so, that's why you see a little bit of a timing delay, right, between the performance of those two buckets of receivables. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Just one last quick one, just we brought it up. The season has been ticking up a little bit. Is that -- is there any -- I know some of it is the Tier 2, Tier 3, but is that just the ABS markets still aren't perfectly loose, you're just not secure as much as you would like to or why I guess why is it seizing up a little bit versus what we might have seen pre-COVID. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes. I think that really comes down to volume. I mean, we're obviously a ton of sales CAF continues to originate $2 billion a quarter. We look at the securitization market and we try and match the amount of the volume that we put into each deal with the demand that's out there, obviously, with our growth. We're doing about $1.5 billion each deal times four deals. We're originating about $8 billion. That has great a year. That has grown over time. So therefore, naturally, it has to sit a little bit longer than the warehouses. I don't think it's anything unique going on there. It's just purely a timing thing. Operator : We'll go now to Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Yes. Wanted to ask, first off, on the provisioning front, we were thinking kind of $90 million plus seems to be a run rate trend and obviously, it came in better. So, is that the right way to think about this, maybe starting with a six handle in the near term given some of the tightening that you've done and all that we know? And then I just had an SG&A follow-up. Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes. So just to touch on the provision once again. Again, two main components. It's any change, we believe in the existing book of business versus what we had reserved for in the preceding quarter and then the new originations. The way I think about that is, let's take the second one first. New originations, we did $2 billion this year. There's a piece of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 business. We've cited Tier 3 is limited. Tier 2 is in test volume. Tier 1 is the bulk of it. You sign an anticipated lifetime loss rate plus the cost to recover from a repossession standpoint, which is relatively small, but a sign up an overall expectation of the $2 billion. That's one piece of your provision. And then, it's a function of how well we've reserved for it from the preceding quarter. As we mentioned this quarter, we felt like we've done a good job. Nothing we saw within the quarter performance suggested we were materially off -- and so that's how you ended up with $68 million. So, I think you've got to bifurcate those two pieces and that's how you set your provision each successive quarter. Michael Montani : And I guess just a follow-up then on SG&A to gross. Is the mid-70s kind of near-term target still the right way to think about that level? And just overall, I mean, do we think that SG&A dollars can continue to come down in the near term if this is kind of the demand backdrop? Or do we start to build SG&A dollars to try to drive volume and share. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. So a couple of questions there. In terms of the mid-70% SG&A as a percent of gross profit, it's absolutely our next step that we've communicated. We've made material strides in driving efficiency in our business. And hitting that mid-70 is our next school. But in addition to the cost management efforts that we've undertaken, we're also going to require the consumer to return with some strength. SG&A efficiency is also a function of gross profit. And so to hit that in 70%, we are going to need to see some decent gross profit growth as well, but that's absolutely our next step. When it comes to SG&A kind of moving forward, again, we're proud of the material year-over-year reductions that we've been able to deliver. And what I'll point out is that we've done that at the same time that we've improved our customer and our associate experience as we migrate further along in our omnichannel, right? And this focus on efficiency really positions us well for when sales rebound. Now for Q4, it will be a little bit more challenging as we've largely anniversaried over our cost levers. So Q4, I would tell you it will be more impacted by our sales performance in terms of that year-over-year SG&A dollar movement. Bill Nash : Yes. And generally, historically, Q3 to Q4, your SG&A does go up to the reasons you're pointing, which is more volume, and as Enrique said, volume-driven. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just a question on inventory. I don't know if you can disclose this or if you have the information, but what do you think the average ASP is in your inventory that you'll sell out? I mean you've seen ASP come down about $2,000 from the peak, and we're still not getting the same-store sales comp lift that you might expect as that price is coming down. I'm just curious what's in inventory? And are you able to acquire inventory at lower prices going forward just to drive the comp? Bill Nash : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Yes, the within inventory now. Keep in mind, what we sold through the quarter it's more than 50% of that was bought prior to the quarter. So what's in inventory now is stuff that was bought during the quarter, which talked about, there's been some steep depreciation during the quarter, and we're continuing to see depreciation. So that should bring prices down. Keep in mind, though, just to kind of ground everyone in any given year, you need about -- just during the year, you need about $1,500 of depreciation, just to keep your sales prices flat, and that's just because as new cars come out, they're more expensive. So you really don't get much benefit until after you get over $1,500 on an annual basis. So I do -- we do feel while we don't disclose what we think the average price is, it is our inventory -- saleable inventory at this point is cheaper than what was sold in the quarter. John Murphy : That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the market share, I mean, obviously, that's an output of what's going on in the market and your actions and competitive forces. I mean how do you think about what's going on in the competitive landscape? Because I mean if you think about a company like an automation at about 1.3 million used vehicles last year. Or on an LTM basis, they just stepped up their buying outside of their dealerships and they did about 100,000 units outside their dealerships from say had been doing before. So, it just seems like that the franchise side, and that's one unique example, but are going after some of the same vehicles that you are even outside the traditional channels. Are you seeing that as you're going out there and acquiring or is that just -- is that kind of a one-off? Bill Nash : You mean as far as the acquisition of vehicles? John Murphy : Well, I mean, the franchise dealers traditionally would take flow from the new vehicle, the trade-ins and other sources. But they've stepped outside of that traditional channel are going out to third parties or not in auctions, but direct-to-consumer as well, and that was an incremental source of 100,000 units for them on an LTM basis, and that's just new, right? That's just incremental and new activity. So, I'm just curious, if that's unique to them or you're seeing that sort of more in general? Bill Nash : Yes. No, I think -- look, you're very aware of just kind of the volume that's out there in auctions, especially zero- to four-year-old vehicles. And if folks are looking for that inventory, they got to be a little bit more creative. So, it doesn't surprise me that other folks are doing that. Our zero to four sales actually year-over-year went up a little bit. So, I would -- I mean that's one data point that you have. I think all the dealers are just trying to get vehicles from wherever they can. And that's why I'm excited about some of the product innovation when it comes to things like Max offer. When we talk about sales efficiency, that's just from the consumers we don't add in there, what we're getting from other dealers. And that product skews more retail than it does wholesale. So, it doesn't surprise me that you have an example of that. I think folks that can do things like that, they're going to try to do that. And then, there's a lot of competitors. Let me keep in mind, there's tens of thousands of competitors that sell zero to 10-year-old cars. Some of them don't have that ability. Operator : We'll take our final question from David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston : Just wanted to ask about advertising expense, which did go up year-over-year, whereas for the nine months, it's down what was the catalyst to make you increase spending this quarter is what I'm curious about. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, that's going to be very much a function just of our CapEx spend and the depreciation there. But then also when it comes to our technology spend, portion of our technology spend is going to be depreciated, right? And so, you'll see that impact in our D&A. Bill Nash : Yes. I think on the advertising piece. Look, we're in this for the long haul. And so, we're going to spend money on brand, we're going to spend money on acquisition. Keep in mind, and we're trying to think about in the new year, how to talk about advertising. When we talk about advertising, keep in mind, that's advertising for sales, that's advertising for buy, that's advertising on Edmond. So all along, we've said, hey, we're going to spend more in the back half of the year, but it's going to be similar on a full year basis. And so we're actually executing it. Now I don't want you to think that we're just like going in advertising. We're absolutely measuring the ROI. But what you got to realize is sometimes if the ROIs not go on sales, you may shift some to buys or you may shift some to Edmond. So, it just depends on what's going on in a given quarter, but we would expect -- and generally, you spend a little bit more in the fourth quarter because it's -- you've got tax season coming, which is an increase in volume. So that's really what you're seeing. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, David, sorry, apologize. I thought you were asking about depreciation. David Whiston : I appreciate the clarification. Enrique Mayor-Mora: You got an extra answer? David Whiston : Are you guys being more aggressive on your offers to consumers who want to sell a vehicle to you with wholesale units up nearly 8%? I was just curious if you're looking to acquire more vehicles. Bill Nash : Look, we want to acquire all the vehicles, but we're going to do it in a very thoughtful, profitable way. I mean you could -- we could buy a lot more cars, but it wouldn't make sense from a profitability standpoint. So, I think the team has done a phenomenal job, especially given the steep depreciation that we've seen, how they've been able to stay on top of it because that's definitely a short-term headwind. Operator : And at this time, we have no additional questions standing by. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, Jamie. Well, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today and for your questions and your continued support. As always, I want to thank our associates for everything they do to how to take care of each other and the customers and the communities. I want to wish all of them a happy holiday season as loves all of you all. And we will talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're encouraged by the performance of our business during the fourth quarter. We're continuing to leverage our strongest assets, our associates, capabilities, experience and culture to build momentum as we manage through the cycle. While affordability of used cars remains the challenge for consumers, pricing improved during the quarter. We continue to achieve efficiency improvements in our core operations and believe we are well positioned to drive growth as the market turns. In the fourth quarter, we posted our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential year-over-year retail used unit improvement and reported growth in total used unit sales and comps. We delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs. We increased used saleable inventory units more than 10%, while holding used total inventory units flat year-over-year. We continue to actively manage our SG&A and we grew CAF income significantly as we delivered a substantial reduction in the provision for loan losses year-over-year, while maintaining stable net interest margins sequentially. For the fourth quarter of FY \u201824, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $5.6 billion, down 2%, compared to last year. This was driven by lower retail and wholesale prices and lower wholesale volume, partially offset by higher retail volume. In our retail business, total unit sales increased 1.3% and used unit comps were up 0.1%. Average selling price declined approximately $600 per unit or 2% year-over-year. Our market share data indicates that our nationwide share of zero to 10-year-old used vehicles declined from 4% in calendar \u201822 to 3.7% in 2023 as we prioritized profitability over near-term market share growth. As always, we continue to test price elasticity to validate our decisions. External title data shows that our market share initially accelerated relative to our performance across the second-half of 2022, but then came under pressure during multiple periods of steep depreciation. We remain confident in our ability to accelerate market share growth as used vehicle affordability continues to improve and as the volatility of vehicle value stabilizes. Fourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,251, relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter record of $2,277. Wholesale unit sales were down 4% versus the fourth quarter last year. Average selling prices declined approximately $250 per unit, or 3% year-over-year. Fourth quarter wholesale gross profit per unit was $11.20, slightly down from $1,187 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter wholesale GPU was within $4 of our all-time record and benefited from appreciation and strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of last year's quarter. This prior year appreciation dynamic impacted our year-over-year performance and buys as well. We bought approximately 234,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 11% from last year. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately 213,000 from consumers, with slightly more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmond sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 21,000 vehicles through dealers up 45% from last year. For our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online consistent with last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 52% in the prior year. All of our fourth quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions. This represents 17% of total revenue. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 30% in line with last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $147 million, up 19% from $124 million during the same period last year. John will provide more detail on consumer financing, the loan loss provision, and CAF contribution in a few minutes. But at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in our used unit sales with strong per unit margins for both used and wholesale and strong CAF contribution growth, while staying focused on managing SG&A. With quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.32 versus $0.44 a year ago, last year's quarter benefited from an $0.08 tailwind due to the receipt of Extended Protection Plan, or EPP, profit sharing revenues, as well as $0.04 from a lower tax rate, compared to a more normalized tax rate this quarter. Total gross profit was $586 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Used retail margin of $387 million was flat, with higher volume partially offset by a slightly lower per-unit margin. Wholesale vehicle margin decreased by 9% to $129 million, with a decrease in volume and per unit margin, compared to last year. Other gross profit was $69 million, down 15% from a year ago. This decrease was driven primarily by last year's receipt of $16 million in profit sharing revenues from our EPP partners. As noted on our third quarter call, we did not expect to receive profit sharing revenues this year as our partners experienced inflationary pressures and consumers returned to more normalized driving patterns. Partially offsetting this dynamic was the positive impact from price elasticity testing on our extended service product. During the quarter, we tested raising MaxCare margins per contract sold, which resulted in a slight decrease in product penetration, while driving overall profitability. We are encouraged by these results, and we have rolled out the margin increase nationally. Our expectation is that this action will drive approximately $20 per retail unit of incremental EPP margin in FY \u201825. Service decreased by $4 million, as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by wage pressures and planned lower production in the quarter as we pre-built inventory in the third quarter, due to holiday timing. For the full-year service improved by $75 million year-over-year. Our expectation is that we will continue to see significant year-over-year favorability in FY \u201825. The extent of this improvement will be governed by sales performance given the leverage, de-leverage nature of service. Third-party finance fees were down $3 million from a year ago, driven by higher volume in Tier 3 for which we pay a fee and lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter were $581 million, up 1% from the prior year's quarter. Our continued discipline in spend and investment levels allowed us to come in flat year-over-year when excluding share-based compensation. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we passed the year mark since initiating our significant cost management efforts. SG&A dollars for the fourth quarter versus last year were mainly impacted by three factors. First, other overhead decreased by $16 million. This decrease was driven primarily from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and from the continued favorability in non-CAF uncollectible receivables. Second, total compensation and benefits increased by $7 million, excluding an $8 million increase in share-based compensation. This increase was mostly driven by a higher corporate bonus accrual in the quarter. Third, advertising increased by $5 million. This reflects an increase as communicated last quarter due primarily to the timing of per unit spend. For full-year FY \u201824, we strongly outperformed the target we set out at the beginning of the year of requiring low-single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A, even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlements. Our ability to materially drive SG&A costs down year-over-year was led by favorability and non-CAF uncollectible receivables that reflects improved execution at our stores, at our corporate offices and by external partners. Our focus on driving efficiency gains in our stores and CECs, the planned reduction of technology spend and by aligning staffing levels and marketing spend to sales. In FY \u201825, we expect to require low-single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A, when excluding FY \u201824's favorable legal settlements. This reinforces our pathway back to a lower SG&A leverage ratio with our initial goal of returning to the mid-70% range over time once we see healthier consumer demand. We anticipate that SG&A will be pressured in the first quarter. As a reminder, we received $59 million in illegal settlement during the first quarter of FY \u201824. Additionally, in this year's first quarter, we expect an approximately $25 million impact due to share-based compensation for certain retirement eligible executives and a lapping of favorable reserve adjustments related to non-CAF uncollectible receivables during last year's first quarter. With regard to marketing going forward, we plan to speak to our spend on a per total unit basis, inclusive of total retail and wholesale units. We believe this more holistically reflects the impact of our marketing initiatives, which support both vehicle sales and buys. In FY \u201825, we expect full-year marketing spend on a total unit basis to be similar to FY \u201824 at approximately $200. Regarding capital structure, during the quarter we repurchased approximately 686,000 shares for a total spend of $49 million. Starting in the first quarter, we intend to modestly accelerate the pace of our share repurchases above the pace that we implemented in our third quarter of fiscal year \u201824. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.36 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. For capital expenditures, we anticipate an investment level between $500 million to $550 million, up from the $465 million in FY \u201824. The year-over-year increase in plan spending is primarily related to the timing of spend for new stores. Like in FY \u201824, the largest portion of our CapEx investment remains related to the land and the buildout of facilities for long-term growth capacity and offsite reconditioning and auctions. In FY \u201825, we plan to open five new store locations. Consistent with our strategy, these new locations will be smaller cross-functional stores that complement our omni-channel strategy and leverage our scale. We also plan to open our second standalone reconditioning facility, which will be located in Richmond, Mississippi, as well as one offsite auction location in the Los Angeles metro market. We currently expect to open multiple offsite reconditioning and auction locations in FY \u201826. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks Enrique and good morning everyone. During the fourth quarter CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $1.8 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 42.3% net of three-day payoffs, which was down 240 basis points from the same period last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers grew to 11.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from the last year's fourth quarter and 20 basis points sequentially. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.2%, down from 19.4% observed during last year's fourth quarter. Tier 3 accounted for 8.2% of sales, up 130 basis points from last year, as a partner began to ease previously implemented tightening. Also impacting each of these year-over-year results is CAF's continued decreased percentage in Tier 3, as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $147 million, up $23 million from the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by a $26 million year-over-year reduction in the provision for loan losses, slightly offset by a $3 million reduction in total interest margin. Note fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $4 million in expense this quarter versus $1 million of income in last year's fourth quarter. The $72 million provision within the quarter resulted in a reserve balance of $483 million or 2.78% of receivables, compared to 2.92% at the end of the third quarter. This highlights the significant impact that originations under our tightened credit policy are having on the Reserve as they continue to become a larger percentage of the full portfolio. In addition, observed performance within the portfolio aligned closely to our reserve expectations at the end of the third quarter and contributed to the reduction in the reserve. The margin to receivable rate of the portfolio remained steady at 5.9% for the quarter. We remain pleased with our ability to maintain a stable interest margin despite keeping our credit tightening in place. As I noted earlier, CAF continues to test across varying parts of the credit spectrum. Ultimately, CAF is building the capability to scale its participation across all credit Tiers, which will help to capture finance economics, drive sales, and fully complement our valued lending partnerships that are a key foundation of CarMax's best-in-class credit platform. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Thank you, Jon and Enrique. Fiscal 2024 was a challenging year across the used car industry as vehicle affordability and widespread macro factors continue to pressure sales. In response, we focused on what we could control and took deliberate steps to support our business both the near-term and long run. In addition to achieving the efficiencies across our entire organization that Enrique talked about, I am proud of the progress we've made in further enhancing our omni-channel capabilities as we prioritize projects designed to optimize experiences for our associates and customers and drive operating efficiencies. Some examples include, for retail, we leverage data science, automation, and AI to make it even easier for customers to complete key transaction steps like vehicle transfers on their own. We also enhance digital checkout functionality for appraisal customers, enabling them to submit their documents remotely and unlocking their ability to participate in our 30-minute express drop-off experience. Additionally, we expanded capabilities for Sky, our 24/7 virtual assistant, to include managing finance applications, vehicle transfers, appointment reservations, and appraisal offers. Customer adoption of Sky has been strong, and this has not only created efficiencies, but also widened bandwidth for our associates. For wholesale and vehicle acquisition, we modernized our auction platform to offer new services, including single sign-on across all of our systems, AI enhanced condition reports, early bidding capabilities, and automated bills of sale. Additionally, we streamline Max offer by rolling out our instant offer experience to all participating dealers. In the credit space, we have now incorporated all of our lenders into our finance-based shopping platform, expanding the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers. We continue to see great adoption with more than 80% of the consumers utilizing the best-in-class pre-qualification product as they begin the credit process. Finally, Edmunds launched a number of research and buy tools in support of its goal to be the leader in [Technical Difficulty] research. These include range tests, charging efficiencies, VIN-level battery health assessments, and EV tax credit incentive guides. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we will build on our progress from last year to further expand our competitive mode. We are confident that the actions we are taking will enable us to grow sales, profitable market share, and buys while also driving additional operational efficiencies as the market turns. Some examples include, for retail we plan to launch an evolved hub within our customers' online shopping accounts that will make it even easier to seamlessly go back and forth between assisted help and self-progression. Customers will be able to see the steps they have taken on their shopping journey, whether on their own or with help from a CEC or store associate. The hub will also guide next steps and promote MaxCare, our extended service plan offering. Additionally, we will continue to digitize work in support of our focus to build a leaner and high value assistance model for our CECs. This will enable existing resources to support higher transaction volume as we grow traffic and drive stronger conversion. As part of this effort, we will further integrate Sky into key communication channels and prove its ability to serve as the initial point of contact across many points in the customer's shopping journey. Sky will manage next steps on its own or seamlessly transition customers to a CEC associate via the customer's channel of choice. For vehicle acquisition. we'll focus to bring even more vehicles into our ecosystem. A key component of this will be our continued partnership with Edmunds to acquire vehicles from dealers. In the credit space, we plan to further optimize our prequalification product by integrating the customer's instant offer into the application process. As Jon mentioned, we will also continue to test CAFs participation across varying parts of the credit spectrum. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities that enable us to provide outstanding offers for consumers, while driving sales and economics for the business. In regard to our long-term financial targets, we're maintaining our goal to sell more than 2 million combined retail and wholesale units annually. However, we are extending the timeframe for this goal between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2030, due to the uncertainty in the timing of the market recovery and as we continue to focus on profitable market share growth. We will adjust the timeframe as we gain greater visibility into the industry's pace of recovery. Given higher average selling prices, we expect to achieve the $33 billion annual revenue target sooner than units. And similarly, we also expect to achieve more than 5% nationwide market share of zero to 10-year-old used vehicles sooner than units. Given the recent volatility in vehicle values, we will provide an updated timeframe for our expected achievement at the end of fiscal year 2025. Before turning to Q&A, I want to recognize two significant milestones. First, CarMax celebrated its 30th anniversary during fiscal 2024. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work that they do. They are the differentiator and the key to our success. Second, Fortune magazine recently named CarMax as one of the 100 best companies to work for, for the 20th year in a row. I'm incredibly proud of this recognition, particularly as we face a challenging year. It's due to our associates' commitment to supporting each other, our customers, and our communities every day. In closing, I'm proud of the progress we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry. I'm encouraged by the sequentially quarterly improvements. We're driving across our business, and I'm excited about our focuses for fiscal 2025. Our core operations are strong and we are well positioned to drive growth as macro conditions improve. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So Shelby? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line as Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. You may now ask your question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. I have one quarterly specific question and one big picture question. On the quarter, it seems like service gross profit was weaker than we anticipated. Can you help us understand how much of that pressure was transitory and how much improvement we should see in the service line in 2025? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Thanks, that\u2019s a great question. We do believe it was transitory. We did have a couple things from a year-over-year standpoint. The planned lower production that we had communicated. So we did expect some headwinds there in the fourth quarter. We also had some wage pressures. Now that being said, we have undertaken in the fourth quarter, which will carry forward into next year, is even more efficiency initiatives, things and for labor specifically. We've invested in RFID tracking of inventory. We're going to leverage our tech and engineering investments to enhance reporting in our stores. We're focused on driving more MaxCare work to our shops and at the same time we've also taken labor and parts rates up to help offset inflationary pressures. So we do expect to see improvement, significant improvement year-over-year just like we deliver this year the significant improvement for the year as a whole and we expect that same next year. Now it is also certainly related to sales performance as well given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. Seth Basham : Understood, thank you for that color(. And then secondly Bill, in regards to market share, you indicated on your last call that you started to see an improvement in market share towards the end of the fiscal third quarter. Seems like things slipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. Help us understand why and when should we expect to see market share increases going forward as the cycle turns? Bill Nash : Yes, great question, Seth, and you're right. Last quarter I talked about October from a year-over-year standpoint actually inflecting positive, but also during the quarter -- third quarter, I talked about the steep depreciation. It was going to be interesting to see how competitors reacted. When I step back and think about market share kind of at the highest level, the two things that have been impacting us this year, and really some of it was last year as well, are affordability and then more relevant to this year is the steep depreciation periods that we've seen. So from the affordability standpoint, we've talked about that throughout the year as far as consumers may be trading down, trading into older vehicles, into zero to 10-year-old cars that maybe we don't sell, or just basically standing on the sidelines, because we see that there's demand out there yet people aren't actually pulling the trigger. The other thing that we saw during the year, we saw two very steep depreciation cycles. If I look at last year's calendar year and I talked about it in my prepared remarks, we were growing market share coming out of -- we were improving our market share coming out of last year. And then we ran into a period, let's call it four or five months, of steep depreciation starting in about April, and it was about $3,000. Then it stabilized for a little bit, and then we finished out the year with, again, another steep depreciation, probably the steepest we've seen in the shortest period of time, about another $3,000. And as we've talked about before, when we see the steep depreciation, that's really when we're testing our pricing elasticity, because we know that competitors, for their own reasons and for their business models, may end up taking down prices to move inventory, that kind of thing. And what we've said is we're going to continue to move forward on profitable market share growth. So I think what we saw in the fourth quarter, dealers were trying to figure that out in October, because a year ago, if you remember, we saw steep depreciation. There was a big influx of where we saw dealers letting inventory go. And then what happened in the beginning of the first quarter, they ended up buying a bunch of cars because they had sold through too much and that drove up appreciation. So I think this year, dealers were a little bit delayed, which is why you saw a little bit of an inflection in October. But then we saw a sell-off in November and December. The good news is that the January data we have, we can actually see where we're improving our market share in January. February, we don't have the actual data yet, but we feel good about February. So I think from a market share standpoint, this value volatility can be challenging and we'll continue to work and that's one of the reasons why we want to see how this kind of pans out over this year before we update that target. So hopefully that color is helpful. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. Please ask your question. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. I guess two questions and hopefully you guys will forgive me. But on the improved affordability, can you give us some metrics around that? I mean, it's clear that new car prices are coming down and hopefully rates are toppish. So what was kind of an average loan payment that you originated this quarter versus maybe the third quarter or some historical benchmark just to give us an idea of how that's improving for the customer? And then secondarily, just on that market share dynamic, is there any region or any particular cohort of demographics that you've been more susceptible to this market share loss as some competitors may have been less rational? Thanks. Jon Daniels : Sure, Sharon. It's Jon here. I'll take the first one on the loan payment. So historically, our average used car was $20,000 forever. So that translated typically, depending on the interest rate, $400 monthly payment. I think that's a good round number to think about. With the appreciation, you saw really a peak probably hit in kind of later, at calendar \u201822 of about $570, $580. That was -- I think we cited that was primarily driven by that financed amount. I mean, rates were on their way up, but that financed amount really was driving that. So that increase we kind of attributed to maybe an 85-15 split on the financed amount versus the interest rate going up. Now as we've cited, clearly, the vehicle prices are coming down. The financed amount is coming down to some degree and rates are going in the other direction. So we probably say this quarter we probably saw roughly a $525, $530 payment. Still two-thirds of that driven by that vehicle price still higher. Now the rates are a bigger contributor, but hopefully that gives you some perspective on how affordability has improved to some degree. Still a bit of a shock to a consumer that's used to a $400 monthly payment coming in at a $530 monthly payment. They're going to have to figure out how they work that into their budget going forward, but that hopefully gives you some context. Bill Nash : And, Sharon, on the second part of your question, not necessarily a difference geographically. We talked about before, your Tier 3 customer, obviously, we have a lot less Tier 3 sales than we've had in the past. Our consumers that make less than $3,000 per month in a household, they've basically been cut in half. So certainly that lower finance customer, lower income coming in customers has been impacted. But we also see, and I talked about this in the third quarter just from working with one of the credit bureaus of the folks that don't end up buying, that apply for a loan at CarMax, it's not like we're seeing this big degradation where they're going to somebody else. They're just sitting on the sidelines. And I think part of that speaks to what Jon just spoke about. The other thing I would just remind everybody on the market share is, historically we have always grown market share. It's just when there's been unusual events. If you go back to the great financial crisis, if you go to COVID. And I would say, now in this period, we've got these very, very steep depreciations. I mean, we saw two this year, we saw one last year, we've just never seen these before. And so I think working through these, we'll get through them and then like always, we'll continue to grow market share. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Rajat Gupta : Got it. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just quickly ask on -- how the first quarter was trending. Given you exited or you had positive comps in the fourth quarter, should we expect that trend to continue here? You know, because seasonality would imply like comp should move lower or negative again in the first quarter, but curious like what you're seeing and any updates you can give us there? And then just a broader question on the long-term target. It's almost like a four-year range, 2026 to 2030. Could you explain the thought process behind such a wide range? And where is the uncertainty really coming from? Is it on the demand side or is it on supply side? Any more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, so thanks for the question, Rajat. On the first question, kind of comp cadence, for the quarter, December, January negative comps, February was a positive comp resulting in a positive for the quarter. Since the quarter ended, it's been a little choppy. We've seen some weakness and right now, quarter to date, albeit early, and again choppy. We're seeing about a mid-single-digit negative comp right now, but again, it's early on and it's been choppy the last month and a half. On the second question, the market -- oh, the long-range targets -- well, keep in mind on the market share, we'll come back at the end of this year and update that. On the units one, yes, you're right, it is a wide range. We're going to come back and provide more visibility into that once we just get a better idea of the market recovery. Keep in mind, I think COGS latest numbers had this year finishing up about 35.5 million units, where traditionally we're at 40 million. And so I think their expectation to ours going to be fairly flat, maybe up a little bit in total used units in the zero to 10, it might be flat to even up a little bit less. So I think you're expecting when it comes to total used units, there's probably more growth in the over 10-year-old vehicles in the zero to 10. And so that's something of -- we want to get some visibility into that, especially when it comes to the units. The volatility also plays into it, though, because it also impacts -- vehicle volatility plays into it because it impacts your buy rate, which ultimately can impact your wholesale. So as we get more visibility into this market recovery, we'll come back and narrow that time frame for you. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes, the expectation is not to hit the wide end of that range. Really is we're going to provide visibility once there's just a bit more stability in the market like building. Rajat Gupta : Just to clarify on the zero to 10-year-old comment. I mean if you look at what's happened with like new car sales the last few years and just users originated on them, is there a chance that the zero to 10-year-old market takes another step down in calendar \u201825 before turning positive? Because that should be fairly visible, right, given what we know that's happened over the last three, four years? Bill Nash : Yes. I think the zero -- again, I think the zero to 10, what the estimates are out there is it's going to be flat to up a little bit. So we'll see where that actually pans out. I mean the -- keep in mind, there is a new car dynamic here where less cars were sold a couple of years ago. But again, I would also look back to -- we saw bigger declines back in the great financial crisis. So we'll see estimates are that it's going to be flat to up a little bit. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for all the cover. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Brian Nagel : Hey guys, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning, Brian. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Good morning. Brian Nagel : Okay. Just my first question with regard to used sales, and maybe a bit bigger picture. But I guess it's much in the business. Look, you got the positive comp, albeit slightly. You got positive used car unit comp here in Q4. And then in response to the prior question, you talked about maybe some incremental weakness here in early Q1? But the question I have is as you're looking at this business, recognizing that you don't give guidance, there's a lot of moving parts out there. What has to happen? Because it seems like a lot of the key factors are starting to turn more favorable for CarMax, whether it be used car pricing moderating, rate stabilization, we're seeing the data, a better tax refund season. So I guess as you look, what's the kind of the equation, if you will, to get back to that normalized used car unit comp? Bill Nash : Yes. I think we've hit on a couple of the major issues. The affordability has to continue to move down. I was encouraged, I mean this quarter was the first time we've been under a $26,000 average selling price in like two years. So that's a step in the right direction. I think there's a lot of positives out there you referred to like interest -- hopefully interest rates at least stable. And once they start coming down, I think that's certainly a good guide as well. I think building on some of the stuff that we've been working on, the efficiencies that we're working on that we've talked about is the fact that we've got sequential improvement. Jon talked about CAF becoming more of a full credit spectrum lender. There's opportunity there. I think there's opportunity in omni. I mean we've got a lot of good things that are positive, but we do need a little help on the affordability. And I think we also -- just that volatility, don't underestimate. I mean, when you have a year where you see depreciation of $6,000, keep in mind, we saw some appreciation at the beginning so it offset some of that. But $6,000 really in two different time periods. We just haven't seen that. And we had another of those last year, I would call them, their price corrections. And I think having some visibility into that and stabilizing that. If you get a -- we've shown like continued market share growth over the years, whether it's been appreciation, whether it's been normal depreciation, keep in mind, normally in the end of the year, there is depreciation. It's probably $1,500, $1,600 a year. We've been able to take market share in all those environments. So I think those are the two big factors for us. Enrique Mayor-Mora: I think a couple of other just demand signals that we've seen. Web traffic was up again this quarter, year-over-year. Finance applications were up again this quarter. So there's demand signals that we're seeing out there just boils down to like we've been talking about really to the affordability question. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. If I could ask just one follow-up. You've talked now -- forget about tightening lending standard. We're seeing -- we're clearly seeing the benefits of that in the CAF data and particularly, I guess, the loan loss provision. I guess the question I have is to what extent is -- are your -- what potential is that, your tighter lending now impacting demand for used cars at CarMax? Jon Daniels : Yes, appreciate the question. I mean, certainly, I think that's the benefit of our platform, right? CAF is able to tighten, and it's able to slow down to partners that are willing to -- maybe they're going to ask for a little more money down, it's going to be a little bit higher rate. But they are going to have the option to buy, and we see people get picked up down the line. We're very careful when we test rates. And we do any underwriting adjustments. We watch it very carefully. We test it. We know what's going to get picked up, and we're very thoughtful about the sales impact and any decision we make, whether it\u2019d be pricing or underwriting. So certainly, there's going to be a few people that might not choose that higher rate that more down payment from our lenders down the line. But we believe, generally, they are very excited, Tier 2 partners are, when CAF passes on stuff, and they can go pick it up. Bill Nash : Yes. But Brian, it's definitely a headwind. I mean we're tightening. We've got great partners and picking up some of that, but they don't pick it all up. And then it goes down to Tier 3, and you've seen where our Tier 3 volume just is in general. So there's no doubt that the tightening in general of the industry is having an impact. Brian Nagel : Got it. I appreciate it, thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Brian. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about sourcing, Bill. You bought 11% fewer cars. I know depreciation is a headwind, but you also have these innovative new tools like instant offer and Max offer that I thought might provide like a secular lift. So I'm wondering on instant offer, can you shed any light on just overall appraisal activity and buy rates to give us a feel for the kind of traction you have with that tool? And then on Max offer, how much of that 45% growth, albeit from a small base, is attributable to adding new dealers versus momentum with the existing dealers? Bill Nash : Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. On the -- from consumers, again, I think it's more -- I think when you're talking about the decline, it's more of a year-over-year dynamic. Buy rate this year was down a little bit versus last year. But keep in mind, last year, I think in the fourth quarter, we saw about $2,000 of appreciation. We didn't see that this quarter. It was much, much less than that by the end of the quarter. That has an impact because consumers always think their cars are worth more money. When you can put more on it, that helps buy. On the Max offer, the increase there is really -- well, we've increased the overall number of deals. The way we think about it, how many active dealers do you have. And of the deals we have, we saw about a 50% increase in active dealers actually using the tools. So we're encouraged by that. We haven't expanded to other areas. We think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to move this along, which is what I said earlier in my prepared remarks. It's going to be a focus for us. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Michael Montani : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask to start off. If you think about this year, is there any reason that this wouldn't be another year for CarMax to take market share? And then is there a need at all to either sacrifice gross profit per unit or potentially loosen credit standards to take share? Bill Nash : Yes. I mean, look, you could -- if you lowered your prices, you could absolutely sell some more cars. But I'll go back to what I said earlier. I mean we're focused on profitable market share. And look, you can see it with the publicly traded auto retailers, they're swapping it off, sometimes units for GPU. And when you look at total comp GPU, it just -- it hasn't been necessarily a good decision. So we'll continue to test the elasticity. Our goal, obviously, every year is to gain market share. I am hopeful just looking at kind of depreciation trends, I'm hoping that this year will be a more normal depreciation and depreciation cycles, but we'll see. And I think that's going to be a factor. And again, I always couch it with we'll always test the elasticity to see if it makes sense to lower margins in order to get more units and more total gross profit. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And as far as the CAF lending standards, I mean, I think that's one of the things that we're optimistic about. We've tightened. We've tightened for a very for very purposeful reason. Obviously, we have partners down the line. But as Bill mentioned, yes, you do lose sales when CAF tightens. But we believe that the cycle will turn. The consumer will get healthier. And we're excited to go after more market share up and down the credit spectrum. So I think it absolutely is an opportunity on the other side of this. Bill Nash : Yes. I'm optimistic with CAF. And I know the Fed is -- there's a decision on when they're going to cut rates. I mean it stabilizes and doesn't sound like it's going to go up. I'm going to knock on wood right now. But as that comes down, that's a tailwind for us for sure on a couple of different fronts from a CAF standpoint, margin standpoint but also from a sales standpoint. Michael Montani : Just how to think about the mid-70s SG&A ratio target as well. Is that feasible for this year? Or how should we think about that? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think the mid-70s SG&A as we've talked about, that is absolutely our next step in our progress. I think in terms of this coming year, we're going to need strong consumer demand also return. There's, obviously two variables in that equation, right? You have SG&A, which I feel we've made a lot of strides this past year, and we'll continue to focus on. But we really need that gross profit number to accelerate in order to hit that mid-70%. I think you hit it in FY '25 would really be a tough putt, just given the level -- the volumes of our unit sales over the past couple of years here. Bill Nash : Well -- and I think also just given that they think that the market is overall going to be fairly flat. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. Exactly. Michael Montani : Got it. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. You may now ask your question. John Healy : Thank you. Just wanted to ask a bit about the wholesale business. It's a nice position where we kind of ended the year in terms of GPUs on wholesale. I was kind of curious kind of how you see that business from a GPU performing in \u201825, just given the expected, kind of, the sending of the used car market in terms of values with improving supply. Do you think we can hold at this kind of $1,000 level for a while? And can you talk a little bit about what you're doing with the auction side of the business? I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're going to build a standalone auction facility, which I believe would be the first one for the company, maybe where you're going with that business and does that decoupling of auctions from the retail location potentially market new business line that you're getting into, not only from a self-sufficiency standpoint but maybe from a revenue standpoint? Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you for the questions. On the wholesale margin, yes, I was especially pleased with the wholesale margin. Just given some of the year-over-year dynamics, the team did a phenomenal job. And I think it speaks to just some of the improvements we made in our overall auction process with technology, that kind of thing. I think you're thinking about it the right way. If you look at it on a yearly basis, I think a good target, give or take a little bit, is similar to what we ran for the year this year on wholesale margins. So I think you're thinking about that the right way. And I think it speaks to a lot of the improvements that we've made in the business. As far as the standalone auction facility, it is -- it's interesting because we actually have a couple of standalone auction facilities that we've built over time, just that are generally located right close to one of the stores from a extra capacity. But this -- you're right, this will be the first time that we've gone out and really kind of built the facility with the intention of it having to be an auction facility. I think going forward, you're going to see some of the standalone auction/production. The one that we're talking about for next year is just an auction facility. We may run some logistics hub out there. But right now, it's an auction facility. And it's really going to help us in a couple of different ways. The facility will be close to existing stores. And we'll be able to take wholesale vehicles out of existing stores, allow them to leverage the lots more from a service standpoint, more from a sales standpoint. We're ending up moving a lot of cars anyway from satellite and XF stores. And now taking them to this location will just help us continue to make benefits or improvements at standalone facilities, and I think they'll pan out well for us going forward. So our intention as we go forward is to build more of these things, get more of some of the wholesale sales out of the stores to free up space, free up capacity that we think will have other benefits to the business, whether it's, hey, you can do a little bit more MaxCare retail service. There's a lot of benefits to that, plus just the standardization of having these bigger locations in closed proximity to stores will also help us to innovate even quicker than what we've been able to do. John Healy : Thank you guys. Bill Nash : Thanks John. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Another market share follow-up, I guess. Bill, why do you think you lose share in disruptive periods? I mean historically, industry leaders in various retail verticals actually accelerate share gains during disruptive periods. What is different about the CarMax model why that may not follow a similar pattern? Bill Nash : Well, when you say disruptive periods, I mean, the three periods, and I think Great Recession, if I think about COVID, I think what we're doing -- what's going on a little bit different. I mean here more recently, it's this vehicle volatility that I talked about earlier. And when there are shocks to the system of large depreciation over a short amount of time, you know how we run the model. We're like, okay, should we lower our prices? And is it overall better from a profitability standpoint? And what we've seen is it just doesn't pan out that way, which is why we hold the margins steady. Now there's lots of competitors don't do that. And they do what's right for their business. They've got different demands. They've got credit lines, things like that. So they have to do what's right for their business, and we have to do what's right for our business. So you will see -- we've seen this year when we hold the prices and others are liquidating inventory for various reasons. We -- trying to give up market share. Scot Ciccarelli : So just philosophically, like is that the right decision over time? Like I understand like you can capture more profit. But if you want to be a growth vehicle and you have been for 20-plus years, I think you said 38, right? Is that the right decision to kind of hold the line on price and protect profit? Or should you be seeking market share? I'm just wondering philosophically how you guys are thinking about that? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. No, I mean, it's a good question. And obviously, we think philosophically, look, the buying cycle is every five years. And who -- if you had asked me at the beginning of this year, do you think there might be a price correction? I would say maybe, yes, probably another price correction coming out of last year. I didn't expect there to be two price corrections. I don't see this type of environment being able to replicate itself year after year. I think these are very unusual circumstances. So I do think that here in the short term, it is the right thing to do. It's not like this is going to be continuing to repeat. If it was, then we would look at the business model. But I think we believe that this is the right move. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thanks, Scott. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Christopher Bottiglieri from BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ian Davis : Hey, everyone. This is Ian Davis on for Chris. Thanks for the question. It seems you've been a bit more reliant on warehouse facilities than ABS in recent years ex the Tier 2 and Tier 3 pilot. So wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how average FICO expected losses of loans in these warehouse facilities compares to maybe what you see in the -- similarly loans and ABS facilities? Jon Daniels : Sure. Yes, I can take that one, Ian. Yes, I mean, I think you said excluding Tier 2 and Tier 3, so we're talking focused on the Tier 1 business. Yes, I mean, our focus is generally to bring in all the volume from Tier 1 into our warehouse facilities, and our goal would be to get it all into the ABS market. Now fundamentally, there are things that you need to pare back. There are certain criteria they need to meet. You need to have a title, they need to have made the first payment, et cetera. So you're going to have some higher risk stuff fall out. It's always going to happen. But our goal is to move all that volume from originations through the warehouse into ABS. Inherently because of those exclusions, you're going to have probably a little bit higher FICO in the ABS deals. If you look at deal over deal over deal, that change in FICO is coming from us changing what we're originating and that ultimately flowing through. Remember, it's going to take six, seven months to get into an ABS deal for when we originate it. But that movement over time in ABS is really what we're underwriting, probably less so what we're holding out into in a warehouse line. Enrique Mayor-Mora: And from a total capacity standpoint, where we certainly leverage the ABS market is the most efficient way to fund the business. We also -- as you've noted, we've also grown our kind of non-ABS funding with our banking partners. We have tremendous banking partners, and we've built out some facilities, additional facilities there. And we talked about that several years ago about just bridging out and having alternative finance options as we continue to grow the business. And that's what we've done. Ian Davis : Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just slip another question in. We had read that CarMax may be removing the 30-day return policy. Is there any truth for this? And if there is, could you contextualize maybe how material abandoning the policy would be to earnings? And perhaps any other context in terms of customers valuing it or maybe using it, any context there would be helpful. Bill Nash : Yes. So what you're referring to is the 30-day money back guarantee. And we're modifying it to 10 days money back, which is still industry-leading. And that's really due to really some experiential headwind, both for customers and associates, which also add increased expenses when you're talking about most of our customers -- a lot of our customers take advantage of it well before the 30-days. You get past the 10, some people are just working the system. Others, what we run into is some headwinds with DMVs and municipalities getting title work squared away, checks back, taxes back, that kind of thing. So I think that's what you're referring to. Ian Davis : Yes, that's right. Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. Bill Nash : Yes. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Pierce with Needham. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Chris Pierce : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask, are we set up for another period of excessive depreciation in the wholesale market because as we get the tax refund season, which we're sort of already through in the wholesale market, there's going to be normal depreciation. But like are we set for further excessive depreciation and what would limit excessive depreciation? Because as far as I can tell, dealers are already carrying lower inventories versus normal. So how -- is there anything that the industry can do to combat that? Or is it just we need to see that excessive depreciation because we need to get back to a $22,000 average used car? Bill Nash : Yes. Chris, I'm not necessarily seeing what you're calling excessive depreciation. I'm really seeing more depreciation that's more in line with kind of what you would see between 2015 and 2019. It's actually, if look at it, appreciate a little bit more. But again, your average sales price is up higher. Just recently have we started to see some depreciation. So I haven't seen what you're referring to as far as excessive depreciation. And I think we may see more of a historical type of appreciation, depreciation throughout the year, but we'll see. Chris Pierce : And is that because of lower dealer volumes or inventories? Or is that what gives you confidence that you think you'll see that -- you won't see abnormal depreciation this year like you saw last year? Bill Nash : Well, I'm just going off of what I've seen so far kind of calendar year-to-date and comparing it to historical averages. The last 2, 3 years, it's kind of been all over the board from an appreciation standpoint and a depreciation standpoint. If you kind of take those years out and look more historical like 2015 to 2019, what does the depreciation curve look like? What does the NAAA data look like? I would say this year, calendar year-to-date is falling more in line with kind of what those cycles look like. So that's what I'm referring to. Chris Pierce : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you, Chris. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. You may ask your question. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to see if you could talk about sort of the split of the zero to six and the seven to 10-year-old vehicle sold in the quarter and maybe on a year-over-year basis. And as we think about this, unless there's some massive economic boom that is not really expected, seems like through \u201824 and \u201825, the zero to six year old car population will continue to shrink, which is a supply issue for you guys, unless you shift a little bit more to the seven to 10-year-old bucket but also would help you out a lot on affordability. So it just seems like it could be a small strategy shift here that could alleviate some of the issues that we're facing. Just curious if you could comment on that as well. So mix and then potentially pushing a little bit more to seven to 10s. Bill Nash : Yes. So I think looking at the quarter, if I look at zero to four versus, let's call it five plus, we were similar to last year. We were a little bit older than the third quarter. So I think our mix is -- it's interesting. It's almost 50-50 when you look at zero to four and the five plus. When I look at zero to six maybe versus the seven plus, it's -- for last year, it's very similar. Let's call it a 70-30 split, zero to six-year-old 70%, seven-plus 30% for us. Last quarter was a little bit -- and I made the remark last quarter that we had a little bit shift in some newer cars. So last quarter was a little bit more in the zero to six than this quarter. And I think, look, as we move forward, and I mentioned this earlier, you're right, as far as new cars, a year or two year ago, weren't as many new cars sold. But again, I would just point to you're still in the ballpark of 15-plus million SAAR run rate, which is much higher than what we saw coming out of the great financial crisis. And the other thing I would point to is that our self-sufficiency now for a couple of years on a yearly basis continues to be over 70%, which we didn't have prior, and we think that's a great tailwind. So for us, the supply hasn't really been the issue, it's the price. Now you could say, well, supply of just overall vehicles out there is causing price to go up, but our ability to acquire inventory has not been the issue. It's more the price. John Murphy : Got it. And then just one follow-up on the sourcing side that you just talked about. You said dealer sourcing was up 21,000 units, about 45% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. Is that something you think could increase? I mean, I think there's some concern that vehicles, late-model vehicles get caught further up funnel as openly, Manheim and ATB all kind of help with their virtual auctions to keep vehicles further up funnel. But it sounds like you actually kind of refute that with the increase in dealer sourcing. How much of an opportunity do you think dealer sourcing could be over time or maybe a risk as they hold on to more vehicles? Bill Nash : Yes. Look, I'm pleased with the max offer. I mean we're continuing to buy more vehicles to that. We think it's a great product that's really resonating with dealers. And when you look at the mix of vehicles we're buying, it's actually skewed more retail than wholesale, which is a huge benefit. I think it's a very competitive product. And like I said, we've got a lot of dealers that are actively using it, and we plan to continue to push that. And when we talked about -- we've historically talked about self-sufficiency. We've always talked about it from a standpoint of just the consumers. Well, it really should start adding in this bucket as well, which, again, just helps keep our self-sufficiency very high. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Nash : Thank you, John. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Bellinger with Mizuho. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Bellinger : Hey, thanks for the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on that last one and acquiring cars directly from consumers. Can you talk through just the quality of those vehicles? Are there any material differences versus those at the auction? And just overall, is there enough inventory out there from consumers in that $20,000 to $25,000 range right now? Or is that more of a limited opportunity? Bill Nash : Yes. Actually, from a -- I was encouraged because this quarter, if you look at our sales are less than 20% -- or less than $20,000 vehicles, while year-over-year, it was similar. It actually was better than the third quarter. So we had more less than $20,000 cars. I think as far as what do the vehicles look like for consumers, buying vehicles from consumers is just a huge benefit. I mean you're buying vehicles that people in that area generally like. And the reason why it's important is to self-sufficiency is because those are more profitable than having to go off-site. And if you're having to go and secure all your vehicles off-site, that's an expensive channel to go through. And we have the luxury of having such a high self-sufficiency that we have to really kind of go out and obtain vehicles off-site on a limited basis. David Bellinger : Got it. And if I could just follow-up one more on your quarter-to-date comment down mid-single digit. Is there anything that's really changed to explain that shift from positive comps in February, maybe some of the tax refund flows that might have impacted, but also, is there potentially just some pause on the part of the consumer with steeper price depreciation lately? And if that's the case, how long could that last? Bill Nash : Yes. I think it just -- it's probably more just speaks to consumer. I think the consumer is still in a tough spot. The tax season -- I think overall, the tax season this year has been a little softer, although refunds are higher, the actual -- the refund dollar amounts are higher, the actual number of refunds is behind where it was last year. And while prices have gone down, obviously, interest rates are higher than a year ago. I think you still have the pressure of the consumers on everything else that they're basically buying food and housing, get inflationary pressure there. So I think it speaks more to the consumer mindset at this point. And like I said, it's been choppy. I mean there's been a -- we've had some weather things going on. It's just -- there's been a lot going on. So we'll continue to monitor and make adjustments as we can as we go through. David Bellinger : Got it, thanks Bill. Bill Nash : Okay, thank you, David. Operator : And we'll take our last question from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Whiston : Thanks. Good morning. Just a two-part question on affordability. You mentioned ASPs are continuing to fall, which is good. But are consumers even noticing the lower ASPs at this point? Are they entirely focused on unfavorable monthly payment due to interest rates? And also on that trading trade-offs scenario for affordability, is the consumer moving into cars away from light trucks? Or is it more just shifting into older than 5-year-old vehicles? Bill Nash : Yes. Well, I think it's always been about the monthly payment for the consumers. And the prices are coming down. And as Jon said, the actual monthly payment is coming down, but it's still over $100 more than what it used to be. And so when a consumer is thinking about buying a car, let's say they're in a car right now. Well, they're making a certain monthly payment. And all of a sudden, they look and say, okay, well, I'm ready to swap out. They're like, oh my gosh, I'd have to pay another $100. That's where we're seeing it. And again, there's lots of data points to say consumers are just waiting on the sidelines right now and either for the monthly payments to come down or to figure out a way to work it into their budget with all the other expenses. So I think that's what you're seeing. Was there another part of your question? David Whiston : Yes. Are they also moving away from light trucks into cars? Or are they just focused on an older vehicle to try to... Bill Nash : It's interesting. If you look at the numbers for the quarter, from a class standpoint, we actually sold more like from a mix standpoint, more larger SUVs, more expensive type of cars. Now the average age, both of our wholesale and retail is up on what you've sold. But it's not like they're choosing to go compact versus larger SUV types, at least not for the quarter. David Whiston : Okay. Are you worried about the off-lease shortage ramping up with the anniversary of the start of the chip shortage? Bill Nash : Yes. Look, leased vehicles have never been a big piece of our inventory strategy. I mean -- and we've been through cycles before where there's been leased cars, and we've been through cycles where there haven't been leased cars. I think we've been in a cycle where there really haven't been leased cars because a lot of the manufacturers are requiring lease customers to take it back to the franchise dealer. We have customers wanting to sell it to lease vehicle, and we can't buy them because of those restrictions. And quite honestly, it's -- I think it's been a nice benefit for the franchise dealers, because they're able to get these things at a good rate base off of leases that were basically done a while ago. That will play out and not become such a benefit as we go into the future. But it just hasn't been a big source of inventory for us historically. David Whiston : Okay, thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We don't have any further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Great. Well, listen, I want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Obviously, we've got lots going on. And we appreciate your questions and your support. Before I close, again, I just want to congratulate all of our associates for being named as a Great Place to Work for the 20th year in a row. We're all very proud of that and really speaks to our folks and the culture that they've really enhanced here and implemented here at CarMax.

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill? Bill Nash : Great. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the quarter, we saw continued positive trends, including year-over-year price declines, improvement in vehicle value stability, and ongoing growth in upper funnel demand. We're encouraged by what we are seeing and are continuing to strengthen our business by delivering associate and customer wins that are differentiated and durable. In the first quarter, we delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs and grew EPP margins. We sourced approximately 35,000 vehicles from dealers an all-time record. We increased used-saleable inventory units 5% year-over-year, while decreasing used total inventory units 4%. We grew CAF income 7% year-over-year under tightened lending standards and post-quarter end we launched our first non-prime securitization deal. We continued to actively manage our SG&A, and we repurchased over $100 million in shares. For the first quarter of FY \u201925, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.1 billion, down 7% compared to last year, reflecting lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 3.1% and average selling price declined approximately $700 per unit or 3% year-over-year. Used unit comps were down 3.8% and we saw comp performance strengthen in the back half of the first quarter. First quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,347 in-line with last year's $2,361. Wholesale units sales were down 8.3% versus the first quarter last year as the industry experienced lower seasonal appreciation year-over-year. Average selling price defined approximately $900 per unit or 10%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was a first quarter record of $1,064 up from $1,042 a year ago. We bought approximately 314,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 9% from last year. The appreciation dynamics that I just mentioned impacted our overall buys as well. We purchased approximately 279,000 vehicles from consumers with slightly more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmund sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 35,000 vehicles through dealers, up 70% from last year. For our first quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online consistent with last year. We continue to see ongoing adoption of our omnichannel retail experience, approximately 57% of retail unit sales were Omni sales this quarter, up from 54% in the prior year. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 30% in-line with last year. All of our first quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions which represent 18% of total revenue for the quarter. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $147 million up 7% from the same period last year. In a few minutes, John will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision, CAF contribution, and our progress in becoming a full spectrum, full credit spectrum lender, which enables incremental growth in financing income. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique? Enrique Mayor-Mora : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove strong per unit margins this quarter for both used and wholesale. We also delivered growth and other gross profit margins and CAF contributions, while staying focused on managing SG&A. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.97 versus $1.44 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's quarter had a benefit of $59 million, which translates to a $0.28 per share from a legal settlements. Total gross profit was $792 million, down 3% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $495 million declined by 4% with lower volume and relatively flat per unit margins. Wholesale vehicle margin of $157 million declined by 6% with lower volumes partially offset by higher per unit margins. Other gross profit was $139 million, up 3% from a year ago. This was driven by an $8 million increase in EPP. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of FY\u201924, we tested raising MaxCare margins per contract, which drove overall product profitability despite a lower product penetration rate. With that, we rolled out the margin increases in late Q4 FY\u201924. [CAF] (ph) delivered $3 million in margin, flat with last year's first quarter. Performance was primarily supported by efficiency and cost coverage measures, offset by deleverage due to lower year-over-year sales in the quarter, as well as by timing. We expect year-over-year improvement for the balance of the year as governed by sales performance given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $639 million up 3% or $19 million. From the prior year's quarter, when excluding the benefit from the $59 million legal settlement received during the first quarter of FY '24. Also pressuring SG&A this quarter was approximately $22 million of expense from share based compensation for certain retirement eligible executives and the lapping of favorable reserve adjustments related to non-CAF uncollectible receivables during last year's first quarter. Excluding these items, which we noted in our FY '24 year-end call, SG&A total dollars were down year-over-year in the first quarter due to our continued discipline in spend levels. SG&A dollars for the first quarter were mainly impacted by two additional factors. First, other overhead increased by $6 million when excluding last year's favorable legal settlement. Continued year-over-year favorability in non-CAF uncollectible receivables was more than offset by lapping over last year's first quarter favorable reserve adjustment. Second, total compensation and benefits, excluding share-based compensation expense, decreased by $3 million, mostly driven by our ongoing focus on efficiency in stores and CECs. Regarding capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total spend of $104 million, which was an acceleration in the pace from the repurchase levels in the second half of fiscal year '24. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.3 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. In the first quarter, we also paid off our $300 million floating rate term loan, which was scheduled to mature in early June. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Daniels : Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $2.3 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 43.3% net of three-day payoffs, which was up 60 basis points from last year's first quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from a year ago. Partner Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.7%, down from 20.4% observed last year. Partner Tier 3 volume accounted for 7.5% of sales, up from 6.7% compared to last year, as our partners improved offers were in place for the entirety of the first quarter. Both tiers saw less application volume year-over-year as lower credit customers remain challenged with affordability. Also impacting each of these year-over-year results, but to a lesser degree, is CAF's continued decreased volume in Tier 3, as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $147 million, up $10 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in total interest margin. Note, fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $3 million in expense this quarter versus $9 million in expense during last year's first quarter. The net interest margin percentage for the quarter was 6.2%, up from last quarter, but in-line with our expected level of near 6%. The provision for loan losses was flat to last year $81 million and resulted in a reserve balance of $493 million or 2.79% of receivables compared to 2.78% at the end of last quarter. CAF's continued investment in the Tier 2 space, offset by the previously implemented tightening in Tier 1, contributed to a consistent reserve to receivable ratio. As was highlighted last quarter, CAF has been building the capability and infrastructure to scale its participation across all credit tiers. First, CAF has leveraged its learning in Tier 2, along with its experience operating in both Tiers 1 and 3 to develop a new full-spectrum underwriting model, which we will begin to test in the second quarter. From a funding perspective, we plan to expand our current asset-backed securitization program from a single platform to one that more broadly incorporates CAF\u2019s receivables across distinct prime and non-prime segments. We believe this will allow us to better align our offering with each investor base and ultimately generate added funding capacity. To that end, our first non-prime ABS transaction is currently in the market with $625 million of offered notes. Having the ability to both successfully decision and efficiently fund the entirety of the credit spectrum at scale puts CAF in a strategic position to further complement our full roster of lending partners, while also driving additional finance income for the business. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Nash : Great. Thank you. As I mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing in pricing and vehicle value stability. I am proud of the durable actions we have been taking to support our business and further differentiate our offering, which are setting us up for continued improvements in our performance and future growth. Some examples include; we've expanded our vehicle sourcing capabilities by attracting more dealers to MaxOffer through product enhancements that make it even easier to use. We achieved record sourcing volume each month of the quarter and are excited about launching this capability in New York during the second quarter. We've increased used saleable inventory units while lowering total used inventory units through [with production] (ph) from new title management capabilities and focused inventory management in non-production stores. We have enhanced CAF\u2019s ability to become a full spectrum lender, which positions us to further grow CAF income over time. We've raised our EPP margins and improved service gross profit. We have achieved efficiency gains in our stores and CECs that will scale very well as we buy and sell more cars. We have launched a number of EV research tools through Edmunds to help educate and build trust with consumers. We've also established test stores in California to evaluate new capabilities that support our operational readiness for increased EV sales and also enhance the customer experience. Finally, we have continued to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities we are rolling out our new order processing system to our stores and plan for it to be available nationwide later this year. The system helps associates guide customers through each step of the buying journey and provides a more seamless experience for consumers who prefer to blend self-progression with assistance from associates. In addition to these actions, we are focused on driving down cost of goods sold by pursuing incremental efficiency opportunities that we've identified across our logistics network and reconditioning operations. For logistics, we are testing a transportation management system that dispatches moves through a centralized team. The system automates communication between drivers and stores and provides new planning and execution capabilities. For reconditioning, we've identified opportunities to reduce costs such as parts acquisition, bringing elements of sublet work in-house and optimizing production workflow. In addition, we believe that balancing production capacity across our stores and stand-alone reconditioning centers, will drive further efficiencies and potentially enable us to take on more MaxCare work over time. All of these actions continue to make a stronger, better position to support consumers and fuel our excitement about our future growth in sales and profitability. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Savanna? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thank you. Bill, I'd love to just kind of start with the top of the funnel for you guys just on same-store sales. I think you mentioned that comp trends improved as we move through Q1. And would just love to get your thoughts on maybe how those improved and maybe what you're seeing now? And just as a follow-up to that, how do you answer the share question because I think that's the biggest one investors bring up is we see these numbers for CarMax, but how do you feel you guys are performing in the market versus peers? And if there is a delta, how do you explain that delta? Thanks. Bill Nash : Thank you, John. On your first question, I think what you're asking is basically kind of comp cadence. So again if you go back to the fourth quarter, we -- the last call we did halfway through the quarter, we were running mid-single-digit negative comps. Obviously the back half of the quarter was better than the first half of the quarter which we were encouraged by. And then if you look at June month to-date for the new quarter, we also continue -- we continue to see some improved performance, and we're actually running slightly positive comp June month to date. So we're encouraged to see this continued improvement there. As far as market share data, if we look at the first three calendar months of the year, which we had the title data four, we are higher in the first calendar quarter of '24 than we were in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023. We were also similar to where we were last year in the first quarter -- calendar quarter. And just to remind you, the last two fourth quarters, we've seen big price corrections. And so that's -- this one was similar. We kind of bottomed out December, we're coming back up. It looks like we are coming up about the same rate as we did last year. So year-over-year market share is fairly similar. On the market share, look there is a lot of volatility there on short periods. And barring any other big price correction, my plan is not necessarily talk about the market share again until the end of the year, because already we are seeing -- we got some markets that are up, some markets that are down. I think looking over the longer period of time is the way to really look at it. So again, I'll update this again at the end of the year unless we see some big macro factor that's having an outsized impact on it. But we feel good about the trends. John Healy : Thank you guys. Bill Nash : Thanks John. Operator : Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Hi, thanks a lot. And good morning. My multipart questions on cash. First, looking at the loss trends and your reserves, we continue to see losses increase in your securitized portfolio, your reserves looked a little bit light. Do you think that you're going to have to reserve more aggressively if the loss trends continue? And then secondly, how quickly can you ramp Tier 2 and Tier 3 lending, as you now have a non-prime securitization program? Jon Daniels : Yes, I appreciate the question, Seth. So with regard to losses and delinquencies within the quarter, I would say largely, we were very much in-line with what we expected for the quarter. And I think that's reflected in the provision year-over-year is basically flat. If you look at our reserved receivable ratio flat sequentially. Certainly we published data on a quarterly basis. Remember, that's roughly 60% of our portfolio. But again, the trends there are as expected -- and bear in mind, in the quarter -- this quarter is typically a high volume quarter, so your actual provision will typically be higher because you've originated more and it's typically a lower credit quality quarter because of tax time as well, so I'll add that. But for the most part, a non-event for us from a delinquency and losses as it was right in-line with our expectations. To your second question, how quickly can we ramp the Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume. I think the easier way to answer that is kind of let us anchor to what we originate today. So 43% of sales, give or take in any given point is largely what we are doing today. The vast majority clearly is in Tier 1. In Tier 3, we've been historically larger, but we are at a small piece because we are really investing in Tier 2 and trying to understand that. It is in the higher portion of Tier 2. We are really excited about our non-prime securitization program. We think that's truly going to enable growth both in the lower end of the credit spectrum for us, to take a larger percentage of sales, but also to expand what we do in the higher end in what we call our higher prime segment. So we are looking forward to that. Now as far as ramping and the timing of the ramp, I would say in the near-term, maybe for the balance of the year, we are going to continue to just learn about the Tier 2 space. We are going to roll out our new models -- sorry, test our new models in the quarter. We are going to begin to learn about the entirety of the Tier 2 spectrum. And that will take some time. And as we grow that, we will certainly let folks know. But beyond that, we do think there is room for us to grow beyond 43%. Will it be 45%, 47%, 50%, remains to be seen the timing of how much and when, but we do believe it is substantial, but probably not doing much more than what we're doing today for the balance of the year. Enrique Mayor-Mora: I do think longer term as well, when you assess when you think about funding capacity, do you think us entering into this market, which we are really excited about, it is probably another $2 billion to $3 billion worth of funding capacity that we are going to give ourselves when you think about how deep we can eventually go over time. So this is a really exciting program, and we expect to drive our financing income incrementally moving forward. Seth Basham : Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho. David Bellinger : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. It's on the expense side. So if you look at the ad spend per total unit, I think that was up about 5% year-over-year compares to your guidance for flattish. Maybe just walk us through any changes you are seeing there on the ad spend line. And just overall, how we should think about SG&A dollars in Q2 and over the balance of the year? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks for the question. I would tell you that's pretty benign, right? I think quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be plus here, a little bit negative here on the total unit basis, which is again, how we manage our total advertising spend. So I wouldn't look at that as anything other than just kind of quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but we are committed to managing to add roughly $200 per total unit for the balance of the year -- for the entire year, I should say. Bill Nash : SG&A on the rest of the year. Enrique Mayor-Mora: For the rest of the year -- sorry, can you repeat the question again? David Bellinger : Yes. And just the second part is overall SG&A expense dollars. Just how should we think about that level through the balance of the year? Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think for the entire year, we are really focused in the first quarter, we are really proud of the fact that once you back out some of the noise that I spoke to, we were actually down SG&A year-over-year. I\u2019d expect that for the balance of the year, that is going to be a little bit more challenging from a total dollar standpoint, but what I'll reemphasize here is what we are focused on. And what we're focused on is putting ourselves in a position through active cost management to be able to lever on low single-digit gross profit growth. And that's really what we're focused on. And so when you look at where we've been for the past several years in our heavy investment phase, that is a different story, right? And it really speaks to us migrating more to a little bit more of a fixed cost structure and an ability to lever when sales roll around which they will. And so that's how we think about our ability to leverage moving forward. David Bellinger : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Nash : Good morning. Brian Nagel : A couple of questions. I'll lump them together. The first, just with regard to the -- this first non-prime securitization. I think it's a follow-up to Seth's question before. But as we think about this development, I mean, how -- what are the ramifications, longer term for CarMax. Is this going to be a potential vehicle to drive better share, better profitability, both. I mean again, how should we think about the model [question] (ph) now with this capability? And then my second question, unrelated. You keep calling out the sourcing vehicles from dealers. I guess the question is the sustainability of that and just also the potential positives for margins or other sourcing. Thanks. Jon Daniels : Thank you, Brian. I appreciate the question. I'll take the first one with regard to the non-prime securitization. Yes, I'm going to continue to anchor us to this kind of 43% of sales, as mentioned, we think there is some substantive volume that we can take above that. And the best way to kind of give orders of magnitude of the value, the long-term value here is we see it under the current financial situation, the current economics for every one point of sales that we can grab we think that can drive $10 million to $12 million worth of value to CarMax. Now bear in mind, that doesn't start day one when you begin to add that volume. Initially, you originate additional volume, you need to provision for loan losses, but eventually it becomes accretive. And once you get to steady state, that's where I'm referring to the $10 million to $12 million. So as you can imagine, as you tackle on additional points, you tackle on additional value for CarMax. And in the long run, we think it is very substantial and something we are looking forward to going after. Bill Nash : Yes. And as far as the second part of your question, Brian, on dealer sourcing, look we're all about sourcing vehicles wherever we can find them. And traditionally, for us we've been sourcing them through consumers. And then what we don't get from consumers we've been buying it off-site auctions. This is just another step to diversify. We buy consumers. We can buy directly from dealers. And the ones that we're buying for dealers, the bulk of the -- it's a little different that we bought to consumers. The majority of those are -- there's a higher percentage of retail cars that we're buying from dealers. So while they are not as profitable as the ones we bought from consumers, they're certainly more profitable than one we have to go off-site for. So we are encouraged by it. We think it's -- this is an area that we can continue to grow. We're getting great responses from the dealers. We've made some improvements to the platform, which I think is part of why you are seeing this continued demand. And if I look at a year ago versus now, we've -- the dealers that are actively using it have bumped up, let's call it, roughly 50% in the last year, and we really haven't added -- I mean, we added a few more markets, but really haven't added that many more markets. So we're encouraged by it. Brian Nagel : Thanks guys. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess it's kind of on the improvement in sales you've been seeing. I mean do you think that broader industry dynamics, do you think there's something operationally you are doing I know obviously, at the top of the funnel is increasing conversion has been down a little bit. Is that starting to improve for you? And if so, kind of where and why? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes. Thank you for the question, Sharon. Look, I think it is a combination of things. I think it reflects on just some of the continued work that we are doing internally, but it's also look vehicle prices, even though they were up quarter-over-quarter, they're always up from the fourth to the first, they were down $700 year-over-year. So we are seeing vehicle values be a little bit more stable. If you look at depreciation trends, for example, -- if you look at the last two years, they're all over the board from appreciation to depreciation and they are steep both ways. This year is a little bit more what I\u2019d call normal, although there is a difference in the first quarter last year, just to expand on some of my comments earlier. Last year, we saw appreciation kind of in this first time period of the year of about $2,500. And then we saw about $1,100 depreciation this year. We only went up about $1,000 and then kind of flat by the end of the quarter. So you have a little bit of year-over-year dynamics. But again just the value stability that's nice. I mean we've always worked in an environment where there is been appreciation, depreciation, what's more impacted us the last 1.5 years, 2 years is these big price corrections. So I think it is a combination of factors. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I just had a question on strategy and operations. I think like you can all see like the factual data on the unit comps, in the market share. It's not where CarMax used to be historically. And if you look at your margins and like the EBITDA per unit, as you exclude the one-time items this quarter, they have not changed or improved. So I'm curious if you think the current strategy that you have around sourcing, the impact omni-channel has had on your in-store culture? Is all of that still the right approach. Or do you think something needs to change? Or are we just waiting for the industry backdrop to improve for CarMax to do better on all these metrics, especially when some of the public peers are doing better? Thanks. Bill Nash : Yes, Rajat. Look I feel great about the strategy. I feel great about all the things that you talked about. I think what's really been the story for us particularly is really what you've seen over the last 1.5 years, and it's been more about these big price corrections. And what's going on in the market, the fact that we sell a late model, high-quality car from an affordability standpoint. So if you look at the data, you are seeing more 10-plus year old cars being sold here in the last two years. I think that's even the same case for the first calendar quarter. So I think the impact on the business have been more macro related, but we certainly have not been sitting here waiting for them to get better. We've been making ourselves stronger. And I think those dividends will continue to come back. They'll pay dividends as we go forward as sales come back. I mean keep in mind, last year I think the total used cars exchange was $35.5 million. It is typically north of $40 million. And the most impacted share of that group is the less than six year old. And again, it goes back to the affordability. So we feel great about our strategy. We feel great about the durable actions I told you that we've taken, which will continue to give us benefits as we go forward. Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. I do think it's important to point out as well, and Bill talked about it in his prepared remarks. Going after aggressively going after reconditioning costs, going after logistics costs and bringing those down. Those are material items moving forward that we anticipate that can support sales that can support margin, both of those items. So we're excited about those. So Rajat, it is a matter of aggressive also going after what we can control, and we can control that. Bill Nash : The only other thing I would add to that, Rajat is when you go through experiences like this, you want to be a better, stronger company. So if this was to happen again in the future, what might you do different. And some of the things we've already talked about, the -- expanding our sourcing, Enrique just talked about really focusing on the cost of goods sold. Jon has talked about the financing. I actually think the financing, not only is it going to allow us to grow CAF income, I think there is an opportunity to actually grow units because I think there's little pockets that maybe our partners aren't picking up that we think are actually good little pockets that we can now do. I think the work that we've done on the variable cost for example. A lot of those factors, the EPP, the increase net, all those factors also enter into the equation on elasticity when it comes to measuring like should we lower prices, should we keep the prices the same. So again, I think we've learned a lot. We've made a lot of improvements. So if the situation has to happen together, we have more tools in our tool chest. Rajat Gupta : Maybe just like on the June commentary, I mean is it fair to expect that the positive trends you're seeing should only get better through the course of the quarter? Or is there some monthly seasonality or comps to keep in mind there? Thanks. Bill Nash : No, look, we are encouraged by the -- really the trend since the second half of the first quarter. Like I said, it is even continued into June. So we are encouraged by that, and we are going to keep getting after it. So I don't have a crystal ball to tell you exactly what's going to happen this year, but we feel good about the trajectory. Rajat Gupta : Great. Thank you. Bill Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, you mentioned some cost of goods sold initiatives related to logistics and reconditioning. Do you expect those savings to flow through to the bottom-line or to drive lower prices? And then is there any way for you to quantify the per unit impact of those initiatives? Bill Nash : Yes. Great questions, Craig. And yes, we are -- from a quantification standpoint, look I think we have a couple of hundred bucks per unit per retail unit that we are going after over the next year or two between reconditioning and logistics. So as you know, that's not insignificant at all. And we are excited about it. It is not going to hit day one tomorrow. But across the two, we feel like there is kind of that amount of opportunity there. And then the other part of your question. Craig Kennison : Do you expect that to hit the bottom-line? Or is that something --. Bill Nash : Yes. So what I would tell you is, I mean, obviously, you have a decision to make when you start to pull that in. As I sit here right now, I'd say look, we'd probably flow that through in the form of pricing. But certainly you have decisions to make as you realize some of those efficiencies. Craig Kennison : Why -- I guess just a follow up, why not take if your prices are competitive today, why not take those efficiencies to the bottom-line. Bill Nash : Well, again, you have decisions to make. And again we will be looking at the affordability. We'll be looking at elasticity. There's lots of \u2013 it is hard for me to say what the situation is going to look like once we get there because there is a lot of factors that play into that. We may take some of it. We may take -- in the past, I mean, you've followed us long enough, at one point when we picked up some reconditioning savings, we took them to the bottom-line. But a lot of the years since then, we've been passing along and it helps us just manage overall margin that helps manage the price. So I just think there is a lot that goes into the equation that we'll have to look at that point in time. Craig Kennison : Yeah, make sense Bill. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : So first, I just wanted to follow up that last question actually. Can you elaborate more on the parts acquisition? That sounds pretty material. Are you going direct to vendor and is sourcing yourself? Or are you asking your retail partners to reduce pricing. And then I have a question on credit. I know I'm breaking David\u2019s rule, I apologize. I hope I'm not doing intentionally, sorry. But the prospectus on new non-prime securitization would suggest there is $5 billion of this type of receivable. How does that $5 billion legacy portfolio that's behind that securization, how does that differ between Tier 2? Like is Tier 2 just like a higher CNL than the legacy 5? Can you just elaborate like how this is different and [where is this going] (ph)? Thanks. Bill Nash : Sure, Chris. Well, first of all, breaking Davi\u2019s Rule, you're the only one that apologize and everybody has broken it up to this point. So we forgive you. The first part of the question I'll answer, and I'll pass it over to Jon on the [non-prime] (ph). So look, we've got unbelievable part partners. Parts partners have been around for a long time. So where we have national relationships with. So that's been great. We just see that there's some parts optimization internally that we can do better on and which parts we are getting from which source and which parts are being applied and not being applied. So that's just one of many things that we're working on. But I don't want you to come away. I think we had this we don't have good partners or whatever because we do, we have great national relationships, and we're pleased with those partners. We just think we can do a better job optimizing the parts so. Jon? Jon Daniels : Yes. I appreciate the question, Chris. So if we think about the legacy $5 billion you referred to, if I look at kind of our overall portfolio or what we originate across our 43% again, we've historically operated our current program. The vast majority of that has been Tier 1 that we are putting into the current ABS program. If we think about that -- those receivables, we are going to basically split that and we are going to create a higher prime program, which is going to target, again we think a different investor base, really give us scale across what we would consider the higher portion of those historically securitized receivables. And then we dropped down the residual there, including -- and then add to that, the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 volume that we have not historically securitized, will be able to be lumped together into this non-prime program. So that's how you think about what we originate today. If you think about what we might go after in the future, there are small pockets of Tier 1 that we've tightened in today that we would be able to capture back, and we are always looking to do that. But then if you look at the entirety of Tier 2 and Tier 3, call that today, it is 27% of sales. That is a wide spectrum in all honesty, across that 27%. And so we think that there is volume being captured across all of that, and we will figure out what the right spot to be in is. So -- but again, this will enable us to grow down there. Now the last thing I'd want to make a point on is our partners have enjoyed that volume, and we love that they enjoy that volume. We anticipate selling a lot of cars in the future, and we want our partners right there with us along for the ride. So we will go after some of that volume in the -- in that Tier 2 and that Tier 3 space. We don't want it all, but we do think there is opportunity to grow there. So hopefully, that broad answers your question. Enrique Mayor-Mora: I would just add said one thing, Chris. I think a general way to think about that split in the program between high prime and non-prime from a FICO perspective, I think of the non-prime is less than [$650 million] (ph) and then the high prime is greater than [$650 million] (ph), just a general way to think about the two pools. Chris Bottiglieri : Gotcha. Okay. Thank you for all the help. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Bill, I know you've had a couple of different questions on market share, but I'm going to try to swing out a little bit differently here. From the outside, I guess, we can see growth rates of Carvana and the public dealers -- given your commentary earlier on mix, do you think it is your mix of late-model product, that's kind of the key driver to the relative growth rates that we are seeing? Or could there be other factors at play, whether it is credit approvals or something else? Bill Nash : No, Scott. I think the biggest factor is really coming off that big price correction at the end of the calendar year last year. Remember, we hold our margins obviously, it is a highly fragmented market. There is lots of folks that don't hold their margins. They are getting rid of the inventory. So I think that's been a big factor most recently in the drop in the fourth quarter and now as we are starting to climb back out. But certainly, I think beyond that -- look as I said earlier, I think there's more cars that are being sold, for example that are 10 years and older, and that is just not a space that we really do anything. And I think the other thing is our bread and butter has always been kind of 0 to 4. That's probably 70% of historically what our sales are. And that's been an expensive ticket for folks. And so there -- we've seen people migrate down. We've seen like throughout the last couple of years, when you look at credit apps, people are looking for a little bit cheaper car, and that's across all the credit spectrum. So I think, there is a combination of things that are going on. And the other thing is we are just not going to -- we've spent 30 years making sure that we have a high-quality product, and we want to maintain that high-quality product. And so we understand that there is going to be some consumers that have traded down. So I think it is a combination of things. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Can I ask a follow-up. Where is -- when you look across your markets, I know historically the older management team used to refer to kind of 10% market share in certain markets like -- what is your highest market share in a specific market, just so we can kind of compare the 4% average to it? Bill Nash : Yes. So we're -- our highest markets are over 10% still. And when we -- and I've talked about this in the past, when we rolled out on the originally in '20. We looked at those 15 oldest markets. And we actually saw a nice little acceleration in market share. Obviously, they grow a lot slower than the younger stores. But I don't know where the top end of that is, but it is the older ones, they're over double digits, over 10%. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks guys. Bill Nash : Thank you Scott. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead. Chris Pierce : Can you talk about supply? I know we are seeing commercial vehicles at auction kind of grow year-over-year with more growth ahead. But is that the supply of cars that you need to come back that will help the overall share of newer cars in the market, gain share versus older share -- older cars and that helps you sort of gain share? Like what are you seeing from a supply perspective? Bill Nash : Yes -- and a lot has been written and folks saying that we have a supply problem. And the reality is we are not having a problem sourcing the cars. If there is any impact on supply or from supply, it's just that it goes into the overall affordability question, but we can get to supply. Now having said that, I think it's great that the SAAR continues to go up. I think the most recent number I saw was like [15.7%] (ph) eventually, and we've already started to see it, to your point more cars that come into the market, again help bring the price down of the used cars and more specifically, 0 to 4. So I think it is more inventory owners. And I think that is good for the industry. I think it is good for us. Chris Pierce : Okay. So just -- you're not having problems getting supply, but you're choosing not to source older vehicles, and that's what's sort of hurting the share, but I just want to make sure I'm kind of understanding where supply is going and the supply decisions you are making? Bill Nash : Yes. So no, I appreciate the clarification because when you asked the question, you were talking more about the supply of I thought later-model cars. If there is any supply issue, it's just if you're looking for an older vehicle, for us we buy lots of older vehicles, but there is only so many of them that you can bring up to the quality standards. So if we have any supply issue at all, it would be more in the older vehicles that meet the CarMax standards. But again, I mean, we've had roughly one-third of our cars are, let's call it, more than six years old. That is quite up -- it's up a lot from where it was before. But if there's any supply, you'd probably be more in that bucket versus the late model bucket. Chris Pierce : So just -- is the supply of vehicles that meet the CarMax standard growing? Or has it been flat not changing -- what's the right way to think about the supply vehicle that you're going to retail? Bill Nash : Yes, I think as we look forward, you look holistically, whether it is an older CarMax vehicle that meets our parameters or younger one, I think the supply is improving just because of with the dynamic that you talked about earlier because the SAAR is continuing to go up, eventually, those cars come in. So and the impact has on us as well prices just start to come down. And I think that's good for the industry, and it's good for us. Chris Pierce : Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate. Bill Nash : Thank you Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from David Bellinger with Mizuho. Please go ahead. David Bellinger : Hi thanks guys. Just another one. Regarding the CDK and the dealer software issues that are pretty widespread right now, does CarMax have any exposure there? Are you seeing any changes in volumes or consumer activity? Just any clarity you can provide on just some of the near-term implications from this widespread issue? Bill Nash : Yes. it's unfortunate for those dealers because I know there are a lot of them. We do not use CDK as our DMS. It has a small impact on us and the way it has an impact on us is -- we obviously work with a lot of other dealers from a parts standpoint. And if their systems are down, it can slow down parts, there is a little impact on title work as well. But I would say it's just minor in the scheme of things as far as the impact on us. David Bellinger : Got it. Thank you. Operator : I'll hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks. Bill Nash : Okay. Great. Well, I want to thank -- as always, Jon, I thank all of our associates for everything they do. I also want to thank you all for joining the call today. And just let you know, we just recently published the 2024 responsibility report, and I would encourage all of you to read it. It provides great updates on several of our key initiatives from climate related to the tangible impact we're making on our local communities. I think we're proud. I think it demonstrates our values and how we live. And it also positions us well to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our shareholders. So again, we appreciate your time today and we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : And this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
