Louthan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Release 2014. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Susan Johnson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Susan Johnson : Thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an overview with perspective on the quarter. Then we will follow up with questions and answers. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that\u2019s www.att.com/investor.relations. Now, before I turn the call over to John let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. We had our best consolidated revenue growth in more than two years up 3.6% driven by strong wireless growth, our best consumer wireline growth since the introduction of U-verse in 2006 and rapid growth in strategic business services. EPS for the quarter was $0.71 when adjusting for some transactional expense associated with the Leap acquisition. When compared on an adjusted basis that\u2019s up nearly 11% over last year\u2019s first quarter. Consolidated margins were up year-over-year due to wireless expansion margin expansion offsetting wireline pressure. Cash flow started the year strong. In fact cash from operating activities for the quarter was the highest it\u2019s been since 2007 $8.8 billion. Our solid cash flow allowed us to make significant investments in Project VIP and the growth drivers of our business. Capital spending was $5.8 billion and that gave us free cash flow of $3.0 billion for the quarter. We also continued to be opportunistic in buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first quarter, we bought back about 37 million shares for $1.2 billion. Now with that overview I\u2019ll turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John? John J. Stephens:  Thanks, Susan and hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today and for your interest in AT&T. Before I get to our operational highlights, let me take a moment and give you a broader view of our business strategy beginning with slide 3. As you know, we have been working very deliberately on multi-year plan to transform our business. In the first quarter, we really began to see the benefits of this transformation effort. You\u2019ve seen us transform our networks from the legacy services to an all IP platform and a best in class network. Project VIP is accelerating that transformation through our LTE deployment, U-verse expansion and fiber build to businesses. We also reached a significant milestone in the quarter with our domain 2.0 initiative. We named two leading companies, Amdocs and Juniper Networks, as primary vendors that will help us achieve our vision of a user-defined network cloud of modern cloud-based architecture. We also make significant strides in transforming the wireless customer value proposition. This transformation began with the move from feature phones to smartphones. These smartphones soon became the remote control of our lives and drove significant data usage. In recent years we began the transition to usage based pricing and away from device subsidies. In the first quarter, we accelerated that transformation, thanks to the transparency and simplicity of our Mobile Share and Next plans. At the same time, we transformed our wireline business from legacy services, such as DSL to IP networks and IP services. In the first quarter this transformation helped drive our strongest consumer wireline growth in years. And in business our strategic business services continued its steady growth. And our transformation is not slowing down. Yesterday, you saw us announced plans that strategically target 21 new markets to expand our ultra-fast fiber networks to deliver U-verse with GigaPower. Moves such as this are one more indicator of our ongoing transformation. Behind all this is the strength of our balance sheet, our strong cash from operations allows us to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while still having the ability to invest in our future. Now let\u2019s get to our highlights for the quarter which begin on Slide five. We had an impressive start to the year. Let me begin with a quick overview of the quarter. We made major moves in wireless that are reshaping the way we do business. We completed our Leap transaction and have begun the integration process. This will accelerate our prepaid initiative as we launched a new Cricket brand in the second quarter. And we have reached a critical point in our wireline business where we can clearly see that our Project VIP plans are working and transforming the business. These efforts results in our strongest consolidated revenue growth in more than two years while also driving double-digit adjusted EPS gains. And we did this while still dealing with a very weak economy. To start wireless execution was superb in the quarter. We had our best postpaid net adds first-quarter in five years and revenue growth was strong. We also made massive strides in changing the subsidy model giving customers greater choice and a more transparent way of choosing their wireless equipment and service plan. AT&T Next take rates were strong as more and more customers chose the installment plan method of purchasing handsets. And the shift to Mobile Share plans was nothing short of incredible. The number of new Mobile Share counts and connections tripled year-over-year with nearly half of our accounts now on 10 gigabyte or larger plans. At the same time, U-verse continued its steady march of transforming our wireline business. In fact we had our best consumer wireline revenue growth since the introduction of U-verse about eight years ago. And the outlook for U-verse continues to be solid, as we expand the U-verse footprint and look to increase penetration. Transformation also continues in business wireline, strategic business services revenues were up more than 16% in the quarter. So, a very solid start with excellent momentum. Now let me provide more details starting with our business our wireline, our wireless business on slide 6. Perhaps the biggest story in the quarter was the strong growth in total and postpaid subscribers, we added more than 600,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter with smartphones and tablets leading the way, that\u2019s more than twice as many as the year ago and the best first quarter in five years. Overall, we had more than a million net ads in the quarter, as we showed year-over-year improvement in every customer category. In prepaid, we continue to make progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the first quarter alone we added 255,000 prepaid smartphone subscribers to our network, this help drive year-over-year prepaid revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we took a major step in transforming prepaid with the close of our lead transaction, adding 4.5 million prepaid customers of which nearly 70% are using smartphones. We are really excited about this new opportunity. Churn continues to be a solid story for us. Total churn was stable for the quarter with postpaid churn down sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. That is a great achievement and what is definitely a noisy competitive environment. We believe Mobile Share will have a positive long-term impact on churn. In fact, postpaid churn got progressively better throughout the quarter. As the transition of our customer base to usage-based plans accelerates, so does the shipping of our handset sales to AT&T Next. Those details as well as revenue breakouts are on Slide 7. The transformation of our customer base can be clearly seen in this quarter. The combination of AT&T Next to Mobile Share value plans has annual level of transparency in the smartphone buying model that customers haven\u2019t seen before. This new model lets customers choose, what plan best suites their need, and many customers have been choosing to move after subsidy model for simpler pricing and for a large number of our customers that means AT&T Next. More than 40% of smartphone gross add and upgrade to the quarter were on AT&T Next, that\u2019s up from 15% in the fourth quarter. We shipped away from the subsidy of subsidy model as major implications. First, when we shift two equipment and service as customer signed up for the next contracts you. You see that in our strong equipment growth to the quarter with slower service revenue growth. Second, AT&T Next accelerates the move to LTE capable devices. About 57% of smartphones on our network are LTE capable providing a superior customer experience on a best-in-class network that also means the honorable sufficient network? And third we see this as an investment in our high quality customer base and in customer choice. It peels back the layers of the subsidy model and allows customers to make clear choices. It also helps build a stronger bond with our postpaid base in a noisy competitive environment. And we believe we are well positioned to use working capital in this way. With our strong balance sheet, we believe we can do this prudently and effectively. Another important aspect of Next, is that these are highest credit quality customers, that\u2019s Next was designed for and that\u2019s who is selecting Next. I talked earlier about our transformation, it leads us to a different set of metrics, than what we have used in the past. Next in a shift to equipment revenue changes the way we look at ARPU. Phone-only ARPU a metric we have shared for sometime and which includes only service revenue increased by 0.4% in the quarter. However, phone-only ARPU plus Next monthly billings increased by 2% year-over-year. This move to Mobile Share plans in the quarter was incredible, more details is on slide 8. During the quarter, we introduced several new Mobile Share value pricing plans for both families and individuals to help customers move out to subsidy model. First, we introduced new attractive pricing for the 10 gig or larger plans for customers who purchase a phone with AT&T Next or bring their own device. Second, we rolled out similar value pricing for one and two gigabyte plans. At the same time, we made it easier for subscribers to move off the traditional subsidy model by allowing them to take advantage of these attractive new Mobile Share value pricing options in advance of upgrading to Next. We see this as another investment in our customer base. The cumulative impact of these changes was significant. First, the number of Mobile Share accounts and connections rose sharply in the quarter, increasing by more than 50% since year-end and tripling year-over-year. Second, there was a major migration of subscribers to Mobile Share plans up 10 gigs or higher. Customers bought up more than two-thirds of Mobile Share account activity with the gigabytes or higher plans in the quarter driving overall penetration to almost 50%, that\u2019s up from just 27% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And third, these new offerings prompted about 1 million postpaid subscribers who were on unlimited plans to elect to shift to Mobile Share pricing. This helped drive the overall number of smartphones subscribers on tiered data pricing to 81% that\u2019s a full six percent point increase in just one quarter. At the same time, we added more than $1 million new postpaid smartphone customers that includes customers who are staying with us and upgrading from feature phones. Our postpaid smartphone sales continue to run in the 90% plus range and our total postpaid smartphone base is at 78%. Now let\u2019s look at margins on Slide 9. In the first quarter, wireless EBITDA service margins were 45.4% that\u2019s a 220 basis point increase from year ago levels. Even though we had a significant increase in postpaid gross add year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by several factors, such as the move to the 24 months upgrade, network efficiencies, and operational improvements. Next also had a positive impact on margins. All these activities more than offset the pressures we saw in the quarter. Cause of strong net adds both postpaid and total customer growth, additional promotional activity relating to our transformation, additional customer care costs related to Mobile Share and Next, and increased start-up investment in prepaid and digital life. Our actions to improve margins also help to ease the pressure from about 1.1 million accelerated smartphone upgrades that occurred in the quarter. These are customers who took advantage of new pricing and move to Mobile Share plans and upgraded early. Without this boost, Next take rate would have been closer to 35%. In total, we had 2.9 million AT&T Next sales in the quarter. And now more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base is on a Mobile Share value non-subsidy pricing, and is no longer tied to the subsidy model. Another margin comparison to total wireless EBITDA margin that was stable year-over-year even with all the growth in investment activities we had underway in the quarter. There is a lot of moving pieces in our wireless business last quarter. The huge shift to Mobile Share plans, the tremendous popularity of AT&T Next, the increase in total and postpaid net adds, and the transitional way for the subsidy model. But it all comes down to customer choice. We are making the buying process as open and transparent as possible and then letting customers manage the process. We believe this is not only best for our customers, but best for our share holders. Now, let me turn to our wireline story starting on slide 10. The wireline story continues to be one of the transformation. That transformation began first in consumer when we introduced U-verse, since that time we have flipped the revenue model. But once with the declining revenue stream at a 4.3% growth in the first quarter accelerating from 2% a year ago. Total U-verse revenues are now at nearly $14 billion annualized revenue stream and still growing at almost 30%. And U-verse now represents almost 60% of consumer revenues. We also see the transformation in our broadband results. More than two-thirds of our total broadband base are about a 11 million subscribers are now on U-verse broadband, highest speed and highest quality product. These gains drove total positive broadband net adds in the quarter. And we are positioned to continue that growth as our U-verse footprint expense and penetration improves. It also helps drive total broadband ARPU which was up 9% in the quarter. U-verse TV continues to be popular as we added more than 200,000 subscribers churn continues to be low as penetration is growing. And U-verse voice, our voice-over-IP product just passed 4 million customers. We also announced that important initiative in the over the top space with the churn in group. We are excited about the new venture and believe the combination of our two skill sets can create something truly impressive. We hope to start rolling out an offering later this year. Now let\u2019s move to business wireline which is on slide 11. While wireline consumer was the first out of the gates with this move to IP, wireline business started the process a little later, but you can still see the transformation going on there as well. The clearest way to see it is in the steady consisting growth of strategic business services. These are services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services. Those services now make up more than 26% of total business wireline revenue and growth is up more than 16% year-over-year. Overall revenues were down year-over-year inline with the slow economy and recent trend, but there are positive signs. In enterprise, our global business services we actually showed slight service revenue growth year-over-year, given recent headwinds that seemed as very positive. The biggest drag on the quarter was wholesale. It was challenged by network grooming, as wireless carriers aggressively decommissioned the legacy circuit. However, if you look at our retail business by itself, enterprise, and small and medium size businesses total revenue was down only slightly in the quarter. And when you look at what business customers\u2019 pay us for their total AT&T bill, both wireline and wireless total retail revenue actually grew year-over-year. We expect our transformational IP will continue to make headway in the business space. At the same time we continue to look for the signs that the economy will improve and provide us with additional lift. Now, let\u2019s look at consolidated wireline margins on Slide 12. You see the impacts from our transformation on these consolidated margins. For the quarter our consolidated margin was 19.3% up 40 basis points year-over-year. Wireless margin improvement help to offset wireline pressure from the trailing expenses tied to Project VIP. Wireline margins were down from a year ago, but essentially flat with fourth quarter. Declines in legacy services, and content, and retransmission price increases pressured our results. And this pressure was partially offset by relative consumer revenues and gains and strategic business services. At the same time Project Agile is gaining steam. Project Agile\u2019s are new initiatives that is improving efficiency and how the company organizes and operates to deliver best-in-class customer experience as in all IP, all mobile and all cloud services company. We are taking our initial cost savings from Agile and reinvesting in the Project. We expect one rate savings in the $3 billion range by 2017. Now let\u2019s move to cash flows our summary is on Slide 13. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong, in the first quarter cash from operations totaled $8.8 billion or about $1.70 a share, that\u2019s the highest cash from ops in seven years and almost four times our quarterly dividend commitment. Capital expenditures were $5.8 billion as we took the strong cash flows and invested in Project VIP. And free cash flow before dividends was $3 billion on track with our full year guidance even as AT&T Next changes the subsidy model. In terms of uses of cash, dividend payments for the quarter totaled about $2.4 billion and we repurchased about $37 million shares for another $1.2 billion. Our board of directors has also approved a $308 million share buyback as we continue to be opportunistic in buying back shares. Since we begin buying back shares about two years ago, we have bought back about 13% of the outstanding shares of the company and save more than a billion dollars in cash from eased divided requirements. We also continue to look for opportunities to monetize some of our assets. This included more than $400 million in sales of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares and real estate in the first quarter. We continue to move forward on our brands to sell our Connecticut wireline properties to Frontier for $2 billion and we expect that transaction to close by the end of the year. During the first quarter we also closed our Leap acquisition. A high level look at that strategy and integration of Leap assets is on Slide 14. First and foremost the acquisition of Leap has clear and immediate benefits and value creation. The value of the spectrum what we see was significant about $3 billion in value. At the same time we will be able to get significant value from Leap\u2019s $3 billion tax net operating loss and turn that into real cash for shareholders. And finally, we immediately refinance about 90% of Leap\u2019s debt which will save us $500 million in interest expense or just the remaining term of that debt. When you add these synergies together, the value of just these items was greater than the total purchase price of Leap. From a strategic perspective, the acquisition of the Cricket brand accelerates our move into the prepaid space. We planned to launch the new Cricket brand in the second quarter combining with AT&T\u2019s existing prepaid operations to create the new cricket with the national presence and more than 3,000 distribution points across the country. The focus will be on simple plans with affordable devices helping customers take advantage of this thing, of the smart new choice in no contract wireless and all this is not a best-in-class network. We are also integrating Leap customers and its networks. The customer transition is expected to take about 18 months as we move customers off of the outdated CDMA network on to AT&T\u2019s GSM network. We will start deploying unutilized spectrum immediately, continuing our efforts into 2015. Integration costs are expected to be about $1.2 billion over a two year period with about half of that expected in 2014. CapEx will be in a $1 billion range, but significantly offset by efficiencies with other wireless bill plans and with the majority of the spend targeted in 2015. Leap operational pressure will drive $0.05 of dilution in EPS this year with most of it in the second half of 2014. We are very excited about this new growth opportunity and expected to really kick start our new prepaid strategy. We are also updating our outlook for the full year after Leap acquisition. Those details are on slide 15. We now expect consolidated revenue growth of 4% or greater for the year as we hold in Leap and see continued strength in wireless and wireline consumer. We continue to expect stable consolidated margins, which includes Leap operational pressure. So we expect EPS growth in the mid single-digit even with the dilution from the Leap operations and continue to investment in growth initiatives. We still expect capital spending to be in the $21 billion range that we gave you in January with most of Leap\u2019s integration impact in 2015. We also expect free cash flow in $11 billion range at even with expected strong Next sales and Leap cost. And you can expect us to continue to invest in our business transformation and growth opportunities. And now I will turn it back to Susan for quick summary of the quarter and then we can get to your questions. Susan Johnson : : In wireline we are seeing the impact of our investments in IP. U-verse continues its robust growth and business continues to transform with growth and strategic business services. I will now close out the call with a quick review of our Safe Harbor statement and then we are going to open it up for question-and-answers. Our Safe Harbor statement is shown on slide 2. This presentation and the comments we are going through make contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially, details on our SEC filings and on AT&T\u2019s website. And now Cathy let\u2019s go ahead and we will open up the call to take your questions.  : In wireline we are seeing the impact of our investments in IP.

(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, very much. Good afternoon, John, if we could start with the guidance revision, and in particular, the Next impact. Can you just talk about the context of where you are in the middle of April versus where you were in January, when you set the original guidance? It sounds like Next is gaining more momentum than you expected. So if you could give color around this 35%, 40% - are you expecting that to be 50% next quarter or 60% in the second half? Some color around what you expect, what we should think about there, and how that has changed over three months. You gave the monthly take rates last quarter; you didn't do that this quarter. And then if you could just touch briefly on Europe. Any update to the commentary around, perhaps, the window being closing there? Thank you. John J. Stephens:  Thanks, Simon. Thanks for your question. First and foremost with regard to Europe, we stand by what we said before for all the same reason we said before the window is closing by the day, but I will say this as you can see from these results and as Randall and I and others have said before we are focused here on this market and you can see why from the success that we\u2019ve had in this first quarter, see why we have that focus here in the United States and remains there. With regard to the Next impact from an adoption standpoint, what we wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that, we made a decision in February to allow customers to early adopt or early upgrade under Next and that drove about 1.1 million early adoptions that drove the margin pressure quite frankly in the first quarter, we were able to overcome it, but those early adoptions to drive some pressure, so the real normal kind of a run rate for the group of customers that were qualified under a normal 24-month process ended up being about $1.8 million, and that\u2019s about 35%. So we did grow from that December 20% or the fourth quarter overall 15% up to 35%, and we will see how it goes forward. I wouldn\u2019t expect that same acceleration from the 15% to more than 40% because of that early adoption, and quite frankly because of the early adoption we may have some impact on the customer during the last three quarters of the year because they move their adoptions up and causes that margin pressure in the first quarter. But I do \u2013 we\u2019re very pleased with the take rates, customers seem to like it and we\u2019re going to expand some of the channels we have the sales in. And so I do believe that the 35% is going to become a new standard, we may do better than that and we\u2019ll see how it goes as we move forward, we\u2019re not giving a specific prediction. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So there has been a little bit of a change in your expectations, I guess, versus when you set guidance originally, because I guess you are only changing revenues at this point. But I guess there are some puts and takes on the other lines. John J. Stephens: Yes, I mean so what we do on our revenues is really off the strength of consumer wireline, what we saw there, and quite frankly off the strength of wireless as much as Next certainly we\u2019ll have an impact, but really it was much more about postpaid net adds and total net adds. And as we mentioned earlier what we\u2019ve seen in churn and this improving churn picture that we\u2019ve seen throughout the quarter giving us optimism about the full year and a ability to raise that guidance to 4% or greater. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the change in guidance. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. Thanks a lot. John J. Stephens: Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike L. McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys thanks. John, just thinking about the higher Next uptake, I think, than what was initially anticipated, and outpacing. The impact on the cash flow \u2013 obviously, you are not changing your guidance for that, but were there anticipated levers that you are thinking about pulling there? And is VIP factoring part of that thought process? And then thinking about wireline margins, what are we thinking about the puts and takes there as far as the ability to increase margin? Does Agile have a positive impact? And thinking about U-verse margins overall, are they starting to contribute in a more meaningful way? John J. Stephens: Thanks for the questions, Mike; let's make sure I knock them all off here if you will, first and foremost with margins in wireline, [we feel we are at] [ph] in our VIP build process, we are going to continue to see some investments and the customers in the build through 2015. So while we are working very, very hard to improve margins as we did sequentially in the first quarter as we did we expect real margin or larger margin improvements in 2016 and forward in wireline, so it\u2019s the first point. Agile is definitely generating savings and we\u2019re optimistic about its impact. But right now at this time we are choosing to reinvest the savings wherever we can in a prudent manner to accelerate the overall growth of the company. Third with regard to free cash flow the real thought process on not changing guidance as a couple of different factors one we came down with the final Leap business plan, we are focused on getting the unutilized spectrum into service right away; we have some commitments on a 90 day and a 12 month process, quite frankly that\u2019s \u2013 putting that spectrum to use, the team is really good at it. They are already well underway on it but it\u2019s not a capital intensive, it\u2019s adding it to already existing network, the big piece the capital the transformation and the CDMA network to our GSM network is going to really have a capital pressure in 2015. So that\u2019s the first point. Second point is our working capital is evidenced by our cash flow operations of $8.8 billion, our working capital was very strong. And we have efforts across the board receivables, payables, inventory management a number of items. The success the overall team showed is being able to achieve good cash management gives us the confidence to keep free cash flow guidance at the same level even with these increasing Next sales. So really that\u2019s where that\u2019s going. With regard to your specific question on financing and VIP, we have a very active process in evaluating that. We have not done that. We haven\u2019t committed to do that. It all comes down to costs, and whether we can do it in reasonable manner from a cost perspective. We are optimistic about the ability to do that and we have a - we are well down the road and talking to really qualified parties who\u2019d be interested in participating with us; we haven\u2019t made that decision yet. Mike L. McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Great, thanks John. John J. Stephens: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead please. John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Okay. Thanks. John, could you just give us a little more detail on the accelerated upgrades that you saw in the quarter? Is that going to continue into the second quarter? And if possible - I could probably figure it out - but if you could quantify the impact on margins. And then as it relates to service revenue growth, we saw a deceleration there, but then stronger customer adds than we thought. How should we expect that to trend through the year? I mean you know, it was a big decrease quarter-to-quarter. Is that going to continue, or is this a sort of a new level? How do those two variables work out? Thanks. John J. Stephens: Well, let me make sure I get things knocked out here for you. John first of all the 1.1 million, let me give you this impression, or this explanation. First and foremost, with an average unit costing about $600, those that are sold on Next would cause us to recognize $600 of equipment expense. On a revenue side, we would start by measuring those receivables which will be $600 million and then basically taking two charges against those, one for an interest charge for the receivable being payable over 20 months to 26 months. But secondly, for the forgiveness of the remaining receivables when the phone is traded in and we\u2019re not giving specific numbers, I will tell you, we have gone by model by model and evaluated the trade-in value, and we take into account all kinds of variables, whether we sold the model, the day it was launched whether we sold the model, six months or eight months after launch, so on and so forth. How other related models been selling in the used market, whether there is an overseas market, we take all this into account. Essentially though I can give you this kind of guidance, on the day we issue it, you could have a write-down on the revenues from the handset from anywhere from zero to 25% depending upon the different facts and circumstances. I\u2019ll just give you that as the way to think about it, you can make \u2013 you could then take that differential, those discounts on interest and those discounts on the trade-in value, and compare how much of a loss that generates per unit, it will give you the idea of kind of the pressure we face in the first quarter from those accelerated units. Secondly, I can\u2019t give you specific guidance on how that continued upgrade opportunity will impact this in the second, third and fourth quarter. The same program is out there, it\u2019s the available number of people that take advantage of it, had shrunk for two reasons. One because the 1.1 million customers already took it and two because we\u2019ve expanded time and some of the people are recovered by, now would have qualified anyway. And so it will work itself down, I would suggest you though the strongest piece of it may have already occurred just because it was so successful on the first quarter.  We forgot the customer adds. John, we are not giving specific guidance on that. I will tell you, we were very pleased with the strength of the customer adds improved throughout the quarter. And the churn improved throughout the quarter. So we believe that this combination of Mobile Share, Next are quite frankly transparency and pricing and if you will, upfront honestly with customers is working. And we believe that\u2019s going position us well in this, what I call noisy competitive environment. So we\u2019re optimistic about going forward with it, but we are not giving any specific guidance. John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks John. John J. Stephens:  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Joseph Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question. John, given the growth you are seeing in data, now with a plan to sell prepaid more aggressively on the LTE network, how comfortable are you with your spectrum position? And you know, we have seen the comments about potentially reevaluating your participation in the broadcast auctions. How do you view your need for low band versus mid band spectrum? John J. Stephens: Good question Joe. Let me first, be clear on something with regard to the broadcast spectrums. We would like to participate at the auction, we are and have been working with the commission to establish auction rules that will fairly promote a good result for AT&T, but we will also pull out successful result for the auction. So we are interested in participating. With that being said, I will tell you, I\u2019m very pleased we got the Leap transaction done. And that we are able to work through with the SEC and the DOJ to get that completed. The unutilized spectrum that we have available to us immediately in over 200 markets that our team is putting into service right now is actively getting that done is really helping us and will help us in quality service in dealing with the network demands. This acceleration through Next in these early upgrades to LTE devices is really helping us with our network, because our LTE network is our most efficient. So we\u2019re moving a lot of customers on to that and that\u2019s another way we\u2019re dealing with our issues. If you will though, the first and foremost is we feel pretty good with our spectrum position right now we feel like we could position ourselves well with the transactions the spectrum deals we done over the last few years. And we\u2019re optimistic about it, but as with anybody we are always looking to continue to have that available. Last question again Joe, was on prepaid and quite frankly that\u2019s a great opportunity for us particularly with the new Cricket brand that if you will platform that distribution, that customer saying that we haven\u2019t necessarily focused on in the past. Second, we believe the network differentiation will provide a real opportunity there. The third as we mentioned 70% of the cricket, new Cricket customers use smartphones. So over that 18 months when we have to transition them to GSM smartphones, it will be really \u2013 it could be very opportunistic for us if we\u2019re able to figure out away to take our next program trade-in and provide those kind of quality handsets to our prepaid customers, not only elevate the cost, but give them a real quality experience. So we\u2019re optimistic about all that, we\u2019ll have to do \u2013 have a lot of work ahead of us, but we\u2019re optimistic about it. Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Great, thanks. Operator :  Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Hey, guys thanks. I guess, first, a really quick follow-up. I wanted to make sure that I understood when you talk about the revenue guidance increase; does that include the acquisition of Leap? Is that in there? John J. Stephens: Yes, it does. Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And that\u2019s about, call it, 100 basis points or a little more. Is that fair? John J. Stephens: 100 basis points? That\u2019s a fair number, yes. Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I guess, second question : as you think about the Next plan and sort of making it transparent for customers on what the handsets cost, are you seeing a different sort of selection of handsets for Next customers versus subsidized customers, when they walk in and they see what handsets really go for? John J. Stephens: So I think it\u2019s a little early for us to make any conclusions on that I won\u2019t \u2013 I say that in suggesting that I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen anything that is really substantially different, so we don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we have and we\u2019re not sharing it. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet. But it is early in the process. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s as much as anything; it\u2019s been a great process for us. When we started the trade-in program last year about the middle of last year and learned about how the trade-in process would work and how to utilize and then taking those skills for us, quite frankly in the first quarter we\u2019re continuing to learn and continuing to refine the process. But I can\u2019t tell you we\u2019ve seen a dramatic change in purchasing activity. Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just to follow up there, what is the sort of reverse logistics happening in that trade-in program? What are you doing with the phones now? And how do you expect to deal with them as the volumes, I would expect, ramp pretty aggressively in the next couple of years? John J. Stephens:  So it\u2019s about expect from the next program itself we don\u2019t have very many trade-ins yet, right, because we haven\u2019t lapped the first year and that first 12 months cycle. But the expectations are couple one we are seeing great take rates on our insurance program, not only historically but specifically with Next. And so these trade-in phones we expect will be used in our insurance fulfillment that\u2019s one. Two we are working hard to figure out a way to make them cost efficiently deployable in our prepaid market whether in specifically in the new Cricket brand. Three we always have the opportunity to sell them on the wholesale market which is what we did mainly last year, with the quality of the handsets our customers use and without having the international standard for handset technology, we were satisfied or pleased with the demand for our handsets that we dealt with last year and feel optimistic, because the handsets we may be dealing with this year might be newer in their lifecycle than the once we had do with last year. So those are the, if you will, mechanisms to make sure we get value out of the process. Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it thanks John Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Good afternoon guys. Great quarter. John, I think you blew through \u2013 definitely our estimates, but I think the Street estimates, on subscriber adds. Can you maybe give a little more color? What's going on? Do you think the overall market is just expanding, or are you guys kind of gaining share? If so, maybe talk about who you are gaining it from? And then I guess we were concerned, and there's been some concern out there, about the early termination fees that some of your competitors are paying. Can you talk about how that process hit you throughout the quarter? Thanks. John J. Stephens: Yes, sure Tim. Let me, first of all I would say that lot of the offers that came out right at the beginning of the quarter. I will say that they didn\u2019t have the impact but I will say that the impacts and everything we did change throughout the quarter, and specifically the biggest impact was the decision to push Mobile Share, value plans in February and early adoption of Next. And when we did those two things in connection, we saw significant take rates and we saw improvements in not only in customer growth customer additions. But we saw a churn come down. And we saw that improve throughout the quarter. So the more customers understood the better it got in the results. So, I guess, real simply, while it's a very noisy, competitive environment, we were able to do well across the board we don\u2019t give individual porting ratios, but we were certainly positive porting in total. And very strong results from all aspects of our business. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe, we should be able to continue with, we need to see how things play out, and how we continue to play in this competitive environment. But we are optimistic about what we can do going forward. Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. :  And then just maybe a longer-term outlook on Next. Have you thought at all about maybe just phasing out the subsidy programs and moving everyone over to Next in the next couple of years? Because it seems like it would be substantially more profitable. I know you talked about going through some of the economics there, but your subsidies were in the $400 range before that. And maybe it's $100 upfront here on Next. John J. Stephens : Yes. So Tim I mean, we certainly continue those things I guess the first thing \u2013 and this may sound simplistic, but the first thing is it starts with the customer. And so our customers still and some of our customer still choose the subsidy program even in the first quarter. So we want to make sure we stay focused on what they have and what they want and be responsive to them. So that\u2019s the first thing, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest that it would be eliminated as long as there is a significant amount of customers who enjoy and prefer it. I\u2019ll tell you this, so as we see the next program grow, who are expecting to see some changes in pricing and some ability for the consumer to drive efficiency in the market, maybe the handset providers are the \u2013 the transport companies couldn\u2019t drive themselves. And that will give us an opportunity to not only to your customers a better deal \u2013 as they drive efficiency, they will get savings. But we believe as they drive efficiency and get savings for themselves to give us the opportunity to get savings under the subsidy model. And that\u2019s a long-term optimistic point for us, so that $400 to reference Tim, we would hope based on the success of Next and the customers purchasing activities in that would help us to give us an opportunity to make in roads into that $400. Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. : Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank G. Louthan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the fiber builds that you have announced \u2013 they put them out yesterday. I just wanted to see what sort of the time frame and the commitment to those markets. And then talk just a little bit about the economics of deploying fiber \u2013 on the GigaPower product now versus what you saw a couple of years ago. It seems like the economics have improved for you. What are some of the drivers of that that are making that more of a feasible build than what you saw a few years ago? John J. Stephens : Yes, so first and far most right now the four markets that we\u2019ve announced in, specifically, Austin, where we made the most progress in \u2013 we are being able to view this within our scope of our VIP program and in our scope of U-verse, if you will able to direct dollars from that effort and move them into this fiber-focused effort of GigaPower.  : And we\u2019re able to focus our build on the customers that drove demand as a oppose to the ubiquitous coverage. And so those two things really driving the success those two things drive the changes in the financial metrics when you can build where the demand is you can have much higher penetrations and get much higher returns to support that build. We will start - in fact, I think there have been discussions today with many of the leaders of the market areas, the cities that we spelled out. We\u2019re very opportunistic, optimistic I should say about those markets and believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned in many of those markets because the existing backbone we have in many of those markets. So build off of and to provide that really high quality service. Frank G. Louthan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay, great thank you. John J. Stephens:  Thank you. Susan Johnson :  I think I am going to call for the last question as we are almost out of time. Operator :  Thank you, that will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Hi guys, thanks for taking the question I appreciate it. So I guess I've got a couple of questions, if I could. So, John, thank you for your kind of walking through some of the accounting practices that go along with Next. I guess my math is that every Next customer is generating something around $500 of upfront equipment revenue relative to the traditional subscriber, who might be generating closer to $200. And that $300 delta times 2.9 million Next adds would be about $900 million of incremental equipment revenue relative to the old approach. And that seems to foot with the year-over-year change in your accounts receivable working capital number. So I was wondering if we could kind of just go right to the nuts and bolts of it and see what was the Next impact on the quarter, specifically, from the differences in how you account now versus how you would have accounted if you just used the subsidy model? And then, I guess, the second question, if I could, was, it looks like you changed the definition of ARPU in the disclosures this quarter. I guess the old numbers look about $2 higher than or $2 lower than the new numbers. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that change as well? Thanks. John J. Stephens: Sure. First of all Dave, we\u2019re not going to give specific details, but let me give you a couple of points about what you said that I think are maybe a little bit need some refinement. First and foremost on day under the old subsidy model, we got about $240. We also got a $200 copayment, but we usually had about somewhere between \u2013 about a $40 activation fee, so that\u2019s the first piece.  Second piece is if you think about an average phone cost about $600 and you would adjust that for an interest charge and you adjust it from anywhere from 0% to 25% contingency loss for the trade-in value reduction, you are going to get a much different numbers than $500. You are going to get a lower number than $500. Second, if you think about what happened in the quarter, we had $1.1 million accelerated upgrade. So this next program generated those, that doesn\u2019t generate a benefit actually that generates pressure on the margins. So I think all of those items have to be taken into account. Specifically I\u2019ll tell you on the change in accounts receivable, yes, there is some accounts receivable change related to Next. Our total Next accounts receivables are going to be in the $2 billion range. I think we said at the end of last year was in the $900 million, but I want to be straight with everyone in a sense that the 12 months receivables, the billings for the next 12 months are in our accounts receivable line because they are short-term, the current assets. And those receivables that go up beyond 12 months are our long-term other assets. So it\u2019s not \u2013 the accounting rules don\u2019t allow us to be that \u2013 have that clarity with regard to it that\u2019s why we provided in our quarterly filings the total Next receivable. With regard to ARPUs, you are right, we are changing it as we\u2019re shifting the model and having people pay for equipment, and choosing \u2013 they are electing to pay for equipment, and for in return, they are taking a discounted service price. Our new ARPU metric is service ARPU plus monthly Next billings and when you add those together which we\u2019ve done in our presentation you can see our growth rates still strong 2% on the ARPU side, so you feel good about that. But if you will, a view towards what the customer is paying us, you know writing the check to us for on a monthly basis. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  So, John, just on that \u2013 so you are adding service ARPU plus a portion of the equipment revenue back into the service revenue number for the ARPU calculation? John J. Stephens: Just a monthly billings. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, just if I could clarify that\u2026 John J. Stephens: And David, that won't tie to equipment revenue, because the equipment revenue is \u2013 you're right. Much when it\u2019s recognized upfront. This is how much we \u2013 this is the $30 a month we bill a customer who is on a 20 month Next plan for a phone that costs $600. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Right. And for those advanced upgrade plans, the ones that kind of you allowed to upgrade early, did you book any revenue for those? Or did you just give them the phone? John J. Stephens:  No. They came in and signed up to pay us, effectively the $30 a month for 20 straight months. So, yes, we booked revenue in the same manner as we booked all the others. David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay. Great, thank you guys for helping. John J. Stephens:  Thank you. Folks with that let me take a moment to thank all of you for being on the call today. We have started off the year very strong and have made major strides in transforming our business. As a result we saw strong revenue and EPS growth, along with major gains in our growth drivers. We drove a strategic shift, subsidy model by changing the way customers buy their handsets. It\u2019s been an exciting quarter and an exciting start to the year. And we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening. Operator :  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.",

Operator Instructions] At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our first speaker Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Susan Johnson. Please go ahead. Susan Johnson : Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon everyone. And welcome to our second quarter conference call. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I\u2019m Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T\u2019s President and CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated and wireline results and Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business. And then we\u2019ll follow with a Q&A session. Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website that\u2019s www.att.com/investor.relations. Of course I first need to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. As such they are subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially. And additional information is available in our and DIRECTV\u2019s SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of AT&T and DIRECTV\u2019s websites. I also wish to direct your attention to the information regarding SEC filings that is included on the slide. Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to provide some additional context for the quarter on Slide 4. We talked with you the last few quarters about how we\u2019ve been transforming our business for growth. This quarter we saw a significant progress, particularly with our repositioning of the wireless business model. First on the network front. Our Project VIP investment plan continues to deliver or transforming our network to a premier IP video-centric network and the results have been impressive. Our 4G LTE build now covers more than 290 million people and we expect to complete our deployment by the end of the summer. And our fiber build out to cover more businesses is going well. We\u2019ve now passed more than 500,000 business customer locations since we first announced Project VIP. At the same time we are investing in our network, we are investing in our customers by repositioning the wireless value proposition. Several years ago we successfully led the transition to usage base to data pricing and now more than 80% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on those plans. Now we are making another successful pivot away from the traditional device subsidy model with AT&T and our Mobile Share Value plans. Customers can now pay directly for their devices and exchange for lower service pricing. That\u2019s an equation that really works for our customers, as you can see with this quarter\u2019s record subscriber metrics. And it\u2019s an equation that works for us. With this an important strategic shift away from device subsidies which has historically netted out to be a multi-billion dollar cost each year. This move away from the subsidy model it\u2019s happening quickly and bringing about many of the expected changes in our financial results. The shift in revenues from service to equipment and the moderation of quarterly margin trends as we achieved increased savings in device subsidies in the back-half of the year, which as you know historically is our strongest device sales season. But the key point is that we have made a deliberate discussion to go down this path and with the results we are seeing, we believe the strategy is clearly working. We see it in our results and we hear from our customers. With that, let me turn it over to John to discuss our second quarter results. John? John Stephens : Thank you, Susan. And hello everyone, thanks for joining us today and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me begin with our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue grew to $32.6 billion up $500 million or 1.6%. This was driven by continued wireless growth as we change our business model. Solid consumer wireline growth once again led by U-verse and growth and strategic business services. Revenue this quarter was impacted by the shift to no device subsidy plans and wireless. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68, as you know during the quarter we sold our equity position in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. After-tax we had a gain of about $0.08 on the sale. The gain was taxed at a higher effective tax rate due to accounting for deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits. While these accounting rules will acquire this high tax rate, we are confident we will be able to utilize existing capitalized carryforwards to maximize the after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. When you normalize to the side, our consolidated effective tax rate is about 34% or about a 100 basis points higher than last year. Also we had $0.02 of pressure from our Leap integration cost, including our non-cash items such as the amortization of customer list. You may recall that we close that transition in March, so this is the first full quarter with these integration costs. When you exclude these items earnings per share was $0.62 compared to an adjusted $0.67 a year earlier. Consolidated margins continue to be pressured by our investments both in Project VIP and Agile and our shift away from the subsidy model to wireless. These well for our investments are expected to drive stronger growth in the second half of the year. Cash from operations continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities in the quarter totaled to $8.1 billion and capital spending was $ 6 billion with strong investments in Project VIP. Year-to-date our free cash flow is more than $5 billion and that after are more than $1.5 billion investment in our customers through AT&T Next. Solid churn to our operational highlights on Slide 6. As you can see, we continue to execute a high level even as we transform our business. In wireless the growing popularity of AT&T Next and the Mobile Share Value plan is having an impact on our results. The customer transition to these plans is driving a major shift in the subsidy model and at the same time helping to reduce churn increased postpaid subscribers drive strong growth of large voice data and improve our net promoter scores or our customer satisfaction results. However, Ralph will give you the details in just a moment. But we are very pleased with what we are seeing from our wireless repositioning and confident in our strategy. In wireline U-verse continues its steady performance of subscriber gains and increasing revenue. It\u2019s now approaching $15 billion in annualized revenues, growing at about 25% year-over-year. Strategic business services also continues to grow at more than 13% and is an annualized $9 billion revenue stream. We also reached a milestone in the second quarter when our U-verse high-speed broadband reached 70% of our total broadband base. Clearly the transition is underway. While we have made great progress, we still have a lot of room for growth, as we expand our base through Project VIP and continue the bundle broadband with other valuable services. And of course in the second quarter, we announced our intention to acquire DIRECTV. This will take our video and bundling strategies and our cost structure to a whole new level. We\u2019re really excited about what this transaction can do. Service bundles are a proven winner for us, and we believe the ability to bundle services nationally will be a big plus. Overall, we are on track with full year guidance and look forward for trends to improve in the second half of the year. We\u2019d now like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide more insight on the strong wireless performance and the repositioning of the wireless business volume. Ralph? Ralph de la Vega : Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s great to be with you today. I\u2019ll start on Slide 7, as John said this was truly a remarkable quarter for our wireless business with results coming in better than expected. We\u2019ve been very successful in repositioning the business model and it\u2019s happening and break next speed. The shift is in no-device-subsidy model is unmistakable, more and more customers are choosing the simplicity of Mobile Share Value plans and AT&T Next. This model shift is driving impressive results. Postpaid churn was a record low 0.86%, the best ever for AT&T and likely and industry best this quarter. This customer loyalty help drive our largest postpaid subscriber gain in nearly five years more than a million postpaid net adds in the quarter including very strong smartphone net adds. The shift in Mobile Share Value and Next has been dramatic in transitioning our smartphone customer base. Half of our smartphone sales in the second quarter were on AT&T Next and nearly half of our smartphone subscriber base has moved to Mobile Share Value plans since we first introduced value plans in February. Even better when customers do switch to Mobile Share they are moving to larger and larger data buckets. We now have more than 41 million connections across 15 million accounts on Mobile Share with half on plans of 10 gigabytes or higher. And the number on larger data plan continues to grow. As more and more customers move to usage-based data plans data use is increasing. We\u2019re still seeing nearly 50% year-over-year data usage increase on smartphones and we continue to add more smartphones connected devices and tablets. We\u2019re also starting to see the NextWave of wireless growth Digital Life is gaining momentum and had its best net gain quarter. Connected car growth is accelerating with new models entering the market such as the Audi A3 as well as 10 GM models that will grow to 30 by the end of the year. These are in addition to those are already in the market such as Tesla, BMW and others. We feel these are incredibly good results in a time of transition. Let me give you more details starting with our strong postpaid net adds and churn on Slide 8. The move to Mobile Share Value plan has really solidified our customer base and this is critically important, retaining our smartphone base is the basis for future growth. Postpaid churn was there an all time low and churn for Mobile Share and smartphone customers were even lower. That was even more remarkable in a noisy competitive environment. This help to drive more than a million postpaid net adds with more than half of those being phone customers as significant improvement from the past several quarters. Overall, we had more than 600,000 total net adds and that includes prepaid declines due to the second quarter seasonal pressure and continued migration of session-based tablets to postpaid. We also saw expected second quarter pressure from our Cricket integration. We expect this prepaid pressure will moderate in the third quarter and in fact we have already seen our prepaid trends improving. Branded tablet net adds for the quarter were 250,000 and that includes 366,000 postpaid tablet net adds in the quarter. We also saw pressure in reseller and connected devices, as we transition of the old 2G network, all this drove total return higher even with our record low postpaid churn. We continue to grow our smartphone base including migrations, we added nearly 1.6 million in the quarter. We had more than 700,000 net adds in the quarter and more than 90% of our postpaid phone sales in the second quarter were smartphones. Sales of LTE devices also continued at a strong clip which is great for both us and our subscribers. LTE devices provide the best customer experience well also be the most network efficient, almost two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base now have LTE phones. You see the dramatic impact Mobile Share Value plans on churn and postpaid net adds. Now let me show you the impact on the subsidy model and revenues. Those details begin on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues for quarter were up nearly 4% as revenues continue to shift to equipment from service. Equipment revenue growth was strong in the quarter up 45% but also we expect that service revenues were impacted. We also saw revenue pressure from promotional activity early in the quarter from a change in the recognition of revenue with the sales of phones through our agents due to the AT&T Next offering. Together these two items are about a 200 basis point impact on total wireless growth. We\u2019re also seeing significant increases in the number of customers who bring their own devices. This is a good thing for us, as it takes all the subsidy expense out of our model and brings on a profitable customer. We\u2019re continuing to see customers choosing Mobile Share Value plans in unprecedented numbers. In just five months about 24 million smartphones or about 44% of our postpaid smartphone base have moved up to subsidy model. That includes about 2 million subscribers on a limited data plans who chose to move to Mobile Share plans. We now have less than 10 million subscribers on a limited plans; our lowest level in years. At the same time, customers who are ready to upgrade are increasingly turning to AT&T Next. More than half of our smartphone sales in the quarter are 3.1 million were on Next, as you can see on the pie chart on the left of the slide, we have about 7 million AT&T customers who are Next customers at the end of the quarter. But the total number of subscribers on non-subsidy plans is about 24 million. This gives us a large number of subscribers who will move to AT&T Next when they buy a new device. By the end of the year, we expect the percentage of Next sales to increase considerably as customers begin to upgrade their phones. And in fact we are already seeing customers do this, virtually all of our pre-Next customers are choosing AT&T Next when they upgrade in our company-owned stores. And we expect sales to increase with our agents and in national retail where we\u2019re just beginning to ramp up Next. The change in the device subsidy model is driving a shift in our wireless mix, but it is also driving higher value with improved churn and more sustainable margins. I\u2019ll turn it back to John, so he can give you those financial details on Slide 10. John? John Stephens : Thanks Ralph. Ralph talked about the great results we saw in wireless in the second quarter. Let me take just a minute dive deeper into the financial and customer value impacts. If you look at the overall customer value that shift away from the subsidy model is very positive. Churn plays a big role in this. Take a look at the customer value illustration on the upper left of the Slide 10. With the year-over-year 16 basis point improvement in postpaid churn, the average life of each of our customers is extended by 18 months. With Mobile Share Value pricing servers ARPU is to drop on a comparable basis. But when you factor in the average life of a customer\u2019s lifetime service revenues actually increased and example percentage that have increased $400 per customer when you are AT&T with over 50 million phone customers. That\u2019s a real opportunity to generate great value. So in short, the customer value increases with Next and this doesn\u2019t even take into account the reduction in equipment subsidy. Going to AT&T Next also takes way most if not all of the net subsidy cost. That\u2019s why can\u2019t just look at service ARPUs anymore to get a comprehensive view of our business. Phone-only service ARPU is down for the quarter, but when you add in Next billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. The average monthly Next billings for the equipment are about $27 per month, driving our phone-only ARPU higher with Next. When this $27 per month is spread over the entire base it adds about $2 in ARPU per customer in the quarter. As the Next base rose, so will this impact on ARPU. We\u2019ve actually already seeing this. Service ARPU with Next improved throughout the second quarter and for June was more than $65, are almost $1 higher than the quarterly average as equipment purchases increased throughout the quarter. Another benefit of moving off the subsidy model which is at the previous highs and lows of our margins become more stable. We did in this business a lot of time and we\u2019ve seen two big drivers to sales upgrades. That\u2019s a holiday season and the introduction of new devices. In the past we usually have mixed feelings about those events was great for sales, with that subsidy cost pressured margins and financial results. Now with about half of our smartphone subscribers already are in non-subsidy plans and that number going up every day. We\u2019re feeling really pretty good about the position we are in. If you look at our expectations for the rest of the year, we anticipate service margins to be more than 40%, while postpaid phone-only ARPU with Next billings will continue to increase as more customers upgrade their phones. Our wireless repositioning story is definitely work in progress, but it\u2019s definitely working. The benefits are clear, lower overall churn, higher postpaid net adds, customers buying larger buckets of data and a shift away from the unlimited plans. First of all, customers like it, they like the clear and simple pricing and we feel really good about where we are and we\u2019re excited and look forward to the second half of the year. Those are our wireless highlight; I would now like to discuss our wireline business starting with consumer on Slide 11. U-verse has been a solid and consistent story for us; we continue to see solid subscriber and revenue growth. This help drive 3% revenue growth in consumer, total U-verse revenues are now approaching a $15 billion annualized revenue stream and they are growing at about 25% year-over-year. U-verse now represents 62% of consumer revenues. They had a 11.5 million broadband customers after adding almost 500,000 in the quarter. That\u2019s more than 70% of our total broadband base that compares to just 40% two years ago. We also added a 190,000 TV subscribers in the quarter, which gives us 5.9 million total U-verse TV customers. The big factor in the success of U-verse is our ability to bundle. More than 97% are virtually all of our video customers had some kind of bundle with us. And two-thirds of our U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us. ARPU for U-verse triple play customers continues to be more than a $170 a month. Now to drive growth while reducing churn, in fact triple play bundle customers has significantly lower churn than standalone customers. We see continued opportunity here, our market penetration stands around 20% for U-verse broadband and TV. But that penetration increases the longer we are in a market, plus this Project VIP expands our customer reach, we believe we can achieve much more. We also continue to deploy GigaPower as part of our Project VIP build sales of our Ultra-fast broadband service have exceeded expectations at Austin and we\u2019ve announced our intention deploy in Dallas and North Carolina. Now I\u2019m taking to our business wireline results on Slide 12. Wireline business continues to be a story of the economy and the shift to IP data and away from legacy services. Strategic business services, services such as VPN, Ethernet, Hosting and other advanced IP services grew by more than 13% in the quarter and more than 14% year-to-date. And now represent more than $9 billion annualized revenue stream. And that now make up more than 27% of business wireline revenue and for the first time strategic business service revenues are now more than half of our total wireline business data revenues. Overall wireline business revenues were down to 0.9%, service revenues were down a little more than 2% in the second quarter. But that\u2019s on track with recent trends and the slow economy. When you look at each of the business components that make up our wireline business, you\u2019ll see some different stories and different trends. Enterprise service revenues were actually up about 1% year-over-year. And this was its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth rate improvement and our enterprise channel continues to provide significant sales opportunities for our wireless services. Wholesale again was challenged by network proving of some of our wireless customers. And we also saw in the impact of our acquisition of the Leap this quarter as those previous external wholesale revenues now are internal to AT&T. While our small business is benefiting from wireless bundles and continued U-verse broadband growth. The lack of new business formations is still impacting the business opportunity. Now let\u2019s look at our margin story on Slide 13. You can see the margin impacts from changes in the wireless subsidy model and Project VIP on our margins. In the second quarter when adjusting for Leap integration expense wireless EBITDA service margin was up slightly to 42.6%. That\u2019s a strong performance especially when you consider our very strong postpaid and smartphone net adds in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion stable year-over-year, the total EBITDA margin was down due to the impact of the 24 million smartphones moving to Mobile Share Value pricing, some promotional activity we had in the first half of the year. And new business investments and things like Cricket and Digital Life. For the quarter our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.7% compared to 19.1% in the year ago quarter. As Ralph said, the shift to Mobile Share plans ahead of equipment purchases pressure our results. Wireline margins were down from a year ago, but essentially flat with first quarter levels. The decline in revenue from legacy services was part of the impact, but at the same time success-based video content cost retransmission price increases and expenses for project Agile and VIP also cause pressure. For example overall content cost increases for more than double, the total increase of wireline operating expenses for the entire quarter. But this wireline pressure was partially offset by growth of consumer revenues gains in strategic business services and solid execution of cost initiatives. We expect project Agile and are moved to software defined networks to provide margin help, project Agile drive efficiency and speed to market as we transform how the company organizes and operates all around our customers. As we\u2019ve said before, we are reinvesting in savings at this point, we feel real opportunity to reduce cost through this effort. We expect run rate in savings in the $3 billion range by 2017. Now let\u2019s move to cash flow, our summary is on Slide 14. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled nearly $17 billion and about $8.1 billion in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were up $11.8 billion for the six months and 16 for the quarter. Free cash flow before dividends was $5.1 billion year-to-date on track with full year guidance even with investments in Project VIP and our wireless customer base. We did monetize $800 million of our Next receivables in the quarter and there continues to be great interest at additional sales. But even after that our net investment in customers increased by more than $1.5 billion during the year. So we expect to meet our free cash flow guidance even with the substantial working capital invested in AT&T Next customers. And net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.71 as we maintain the best credit rating major U.S. telecom company. In terms of cash, I think you know the story, dividend payments remain our first priority and year-to-date total $4.8 billion and we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program. Our asset sales including Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil also strengthened our cash position and balance sheet. We ended the quarter with more than a $11 billion of cash about 4.6 that has already been used for debt redemption leaving more than 6 billion of cash on hand at the current time. We have balance in flexibility to pay down more debt and position ourselves for the upcoming spectrum auctions and DIRECTV acquisition, while investing in the growth of our business. In fact I believe we\u2019re continuing to maximize our balance sheet efficiency. We expect another $3 billion of asset monetization by the end of the year, with the sale of our Connecticut wireline property and remaining proceeds from our Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil sale. The DIRECTV transaction continues to move forward, Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator has approved it without restrictions and we have completed the reviewing process at the state level without conditions, which included Arizona, Louisiana and Hawaii. We also received good news today when the Department of Labor\u2019s approval notice allowing us to fund our pension plans with the preferred equity interest in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil was posted in the federal register website. Now let me close with a quick summary and a recap of our full year 2014 expectations. There continues to be a lot of moving parts in this quarter and throughout the remainder of the year. We\u2019re confident; we\u2019re heading in the right direction. We staked out our course in our plan for the year and we are confident that we are on the right track. First we expect consolidated revenue growth at the low end of the 5% range to define that, but said that, we will say that the range is, we define that range as 4.5% to 5.5% and expect the numbers of the AT&T Next upgrades to ramp substantially in the second half of the year powering that growth. Second, we see stable consolidated margins as we\u2019ve begun to realize greater benefits, as more customers shift away from the subsidy model to the back-half of the year. We continue to expect adjusted EPS in a low end of the mid-single digit range even with the pressure from Leap integration cost and loss of the Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil equity income. We\u2019re still targeting capital spending in $21 billion range even as we accelerated investment in the first half of the year. And we expect free cash flow in the $11 billion range even with strong AT&T Next sales. I now will turn it back to Susan to take your questions. Susan Johnson : Thank you, John. Nick I\u2019m going to return the call back to you for instructions for our Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies: Hey guys thanks. Maybe just to comment on the churn side, obviously you\u2019re getting the benefit probably it\u2019s somewhat due to lower pricing points, how do we get more confident that this is going to be a long-term benefit? And then just secondarily on the Leap side, how many of those customers if any we\u2019re able to migrate on the postpaid platform? Thanks. John Stephens : Ralph do you want to take the question? Ralph de la Vega : Yes, let me comment a little bit on that, Mike when John was going over the chart he was explaining just the extension that we see in the customer life time value, when you take our overall churn going from 1.02 to 0.086. The thing that is really encouraging to me is that that is the total average for postpaid. When you look at smartphones, you see a similar change and what is driving the overall churn down our smartphones. And then when you look at smartphones on Mobile Share Value plans and Next they are even lower. So what we\u2019re doing is working, I\u2019ll give you one proof point that was really encouraging to me in the second quarter. In the second quarter typically churn for our company goes up in May and June compared to April. What we saw in this quarter was a change in the trend, so both May and June were actually lower in churn than April despite all the competitive activity that\u2019s going on. So we feel very certain that as more and more customers sign up to Mobile Share Value plans and Next it solidifies our scores in terms of churn and we\u2019re seeing the same thing in our net promoter scores. Our net promoter scores for customers who are in Mobile Share Value plans compared to family talk for example are twice the number. So every indication we have from our customers is that these are sustainable and sustainable even during some pretty intense competitive activities as we always see in the wireless business. Now you are asking about Cricket, let me give you a quick update on Cricket. As you know, we actually launched Cricket on a nationwide basis, the new Cricket on the 19th of May. So that was relatively short, but I\u2019m very pleased with what happened we successfully converted both the AIO brand the old Cricket brand to the new Cricket brand. We rebranded the stores and we started converting customers at rates that we expect that from the old CDMA network that LeapPad to our GSM network and Mike the results are really, really encouraging. As you know that network covers 97% of the customers, it doesn\u2019t include roaming. But what we\u2019re seeing is net promoter scores again of Cricket customers improving month after month as they get the sample, the GSM network compared to their old CDMA network. And so the migration are on schedule and we\u2019re seeing improving trends in terms of the net additions since we completed the conversion. In fact if you look at the second quarter, Cricket numbers compared to a year ago, we have reduced the factors (ph) by one-third. Just in the first quarter alone and what we\u2019re seeing in July is an improving trend that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue throughout the year. Again as customers sample this great network that they have now that is a nationwide network as we move those customers over, we are seeing lower churn. So, we feel really good about what we did with Cricket and we\u2019re really excited about the results we\u2019re seeing with Mobile Share Value plans and Next in driving lower churn. Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies: Hey Ralph I\u2019m sorry just for the clarification on the Leap migration, did you get any benefit on the postpaid side from customers from Leap? Ralph de la Vega : No not any significant improvement no Mike there was no \u2013 no significant movement from prepaid to postpaid in our case. Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies: Great that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Ralph. John Stephens : Thanks Mike. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Okay thanks guys. Maybe first just a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question for Ralph and then another one for John. Ralph is there any, I like that where you are going with the churn, is there any risk that churn could start to move up within the Next phase once the \u2013 maybe the pre-Next people that you\u2019ve moved over they are do for handset and we\u2019re probably looking the new iPhone later this year. We start to see the bill sort of, they\u2019ve already seen the bill were down start to see it go back up again and maybe talk about your experience there? And then maybe for John, in your prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, you talked about some stronger growth and stronger trends in the second half. Is it just equipment driven or can you give us a little more detail on what some of those trends are and to the point where we have an eye when we will start to see service revenue trends start to churn? Ralph de la Vega : John on your comment about what happens as people upgrade to Next as we have mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re already seeing about half of our smartphone sales go on Next and that\u2019s the same experience that you are referring to and those customers when we sample them their net promoter scores are high. So we are not seeing any concerns at this point and I think that once they get on Next they are going to be able to get the new smartphone every year or every 18 months depending on the plans that they select. So we feel really good so far, but everything we have seen from the plans no major concerns. John Stephens : John specifically the customers that we allow to go up on the Mobile Share Value plans early and then it\u2019s subsequently come in. We\u2019ve seen great stay on rates over 90% of the company-owned stores where they\u2019ve stayed on the Next program. So they like it, they really seem to be very sticky. So we feel good about where it\u2019s going, but we\u2019re going to watch closely. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Got you. John Stephens : With regard to the stronger trends there is a couple of things that are just really important, one when you add a million customers on the quarter and we added total change was 1.6 million smartphones that was a conversion of about 900,000 feature phones to smartphones. And then there was net adds postpaid smartphone net adds of 700,000. So that\u2019s a really significant number, we had another good quarter of tablets, about 350,000. But we really had great performance on our smartphone net adds. So that gives us confidence in generally more revenue. Additionally we are seeing people take insurance, almost sort of 50% clip on our Next sales. So that\u2019s going to help and we continue to find satisfaction of those insurance rates anywhere from $7 to $10 a month. We see really good results there. Third, we\u2019re seeing people buy bigger buckets as we mentioned. I think we mentioned Ralph mentioned that there was 14 million or so Mobile Share Value accounts, over half or about half of those are taking 10 Gig or better. And with the new phones coming up people are using more data, we continue to see usage growth which is going to drive revenue growth. All of those things are what give us confident in what we see and why we believe there is going to be real opportunity for improving revenue trends. Lastly, there are much so we think the Next take rate and especially with the opportunity for maybe some new devices in the holiday season will also generate some improvement in our numbers. So feel really good about kind of the whole package not just the equipment story. Ralph de la Vega : John one other thing that I think we both feel good about is if you look at those larger data buckets we mentioned that about half of our base is on buckets that are 10 gigs or higher. But if you look at actually as customers add lines to their Mobile Share Value plans, we\u2019re seeing that number that are selecting the 10 gig or higher plan to be 70%. So we got about half the base, but on the \u2013 the ones that are getting added the take rates are even significantly higher. So it gives us great encouragement and as you look at Mobile Share and Next, number one is producing lower churn and number of customer life times. Number two, it\u2019s actually reducing our subsidies and number three, is resulting in these large data bucket purchases that we know will increase ARPU as we define it now could be phone-only ARPU plus Next billings. Those are expected to increase for the remainder of the year. So we feel really good the strategy is working and it\u2019s evident is intending the results. John Stephens : John let me give one other thing that I\u2019m sure (indiscernible) about 200 basis point pressure in the wireless margin, wireless revenue growth this quarter and it has to do with, we\u2019re now selling our \u2013 our Next program through our agents. And so and sort of recognizing the revenue when we deliver to the agent, we recognize the revenue when they deliver to the customer and so that delayed and have the impact on revenue score. By the end of the year, we think we\u2019ll get that back especially in the holiday season where the inventories are traditionally low. In addition, we had some early on in the quarter; we had some pressure from some promotional activities, as you know we really have a round of significant promotional activities since the April timeframe. So we think we\u2019ve got most of that pressure buying this. When you put those two things together, we have a better starting point that we may appear based on our \u2013 on the appropriately reported results. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Got it. Okay thanks for the detail guys. John Stephens : Thanks. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi thanks for taking the question. Ralph can you give us the sense for the exit rate for churn at the end of the quarter? And then John you just mentioned the promotional activity, do you have an idea of how much of the sub-growth was actually driven by the promotional activity we saw early on in the quarter? Ralph de la Vega : First on the churn in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier what is really encouraging is that we saw both May and June be lower than our postpaid churn in April and usually is the reverse. So it says that that the plans that we have put in place are bending the curve in the right direction, trending to lower churn in the back-half of the quarter as suppose to being higher which is traditionally what we have seen in mobility. So it is very encouraging and we\u2019re seeing very good churn levels at this point. So, I think anything that will drive it in a different direction. John Stephens : We \u2013 shall we bolster in the whole operation, we are very optimistic about churn continuing to improve kind of an year-over-year basis compared to the historical levels. So we feel really good about that. With regard to the net adds we have, we really haven\u2019t had any significant promotional programs in a fact in May or June, we had some in March and some of the cost of those were appropriate carryforward when the customers are earning those discounts were actually on April. So we really didn\u2019t see much in the way of significant customer change with regard to that. We may have seen some of that benefit in March, but I will tell you it seems like in the new environment we and a lot of our competitors were very active in that. And quite frankly we were not; we were not as active as others. Ralph de la Vega : By the way Joe one other point of reference, the 0.86% churn number as far as I know if you go back and look at the history of wireless is the second lowest churn ever reported by a company in the history of wireless and the one that was lower than that was only two basis points lower two years ago. So not only is at the lowest were AT&T, but some of the lowest churns ever reported by any company in wireless. John Stephens : Obviously Joe we feel real good about where we are and how we\u2019re performing and the team is doing great job. Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay guys thanks. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks a lot, good evening. John on capital spending you reiterated the $21 billion that implies about a 20% drop second half versus first half and I know there has been a lot of talk in the market around the CapEx freezes and so forth. So perhaps you could just provide a little clarity about how you are going to get there and what impact that has on wireless or wireline? And then for Ralph, I think in the June release you said about one half of customers would be on no-device plans by mid-year and two-thirds by the end of the year. I think you hit 44%, so as we go into Q3 and Q4 you\u2019re still targeting about two-thirds number or are we coming in a little bit lower than that? Thanks. Ralph de la Vega : Let me answer the last one first Simon, and yes that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re targeting. What we have seen Simon is first of all we started with our company-owned retail stores and it was a huge smash hit. Then we brought in our dealers and they have been a huge smash hit, almost exactly the same performance that we saw in our company-owned retails, which are much higher than the averages that we are reporting. Now we\u2019re bringing national retails, these are national retail agents that have not sold Next up to this point, will be coming online. And so we expect those to come online in the third and fourth quarters further increasing the rates. So we\u2019re fairly confident that you\u2019re going to see an increase from the rates that we reported in the second quarter. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Perfect, okay. John Stephens : Simon with regard to the CapEx story as we did reiterate that we will be in a $21 billion range and we\u2019re going to stay with that. With regard to the commentary on over about a billion dollar spend in the first six months; I guess I\u2019m more aware of the commentary that the talk that many have had that we had changed our spending patterns based on those numbers. It would seem that some people are misinformed maybe have been more about the spread or the hearing amongst our \u2013 amongst our spend. If you\u2019re thinking about how we\u2019re going to get down to the $21 billion, I would suggest this we are very near complete with our $300 million LTE build. And in fact we expect to complete that later this summer. So most of the spending for that and much of spending for the network intensification has been already placed. We just need to go out and utilize and put those assets in the services, which we have to do. Secondly, we\u2019ve done a lot of other of our systems and other corporate work with regard to laying out fiber and other things that we expect will moderate in the second half of the year and focus more on the utilization of assets that we placed in service. So, certainly it will be a challenge and be a lot of work. We feel good about the fact that we can stand at $21 billion range. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays: Thank you very much and good afternoon folks. John Stephens : Good afternoon. Ralph de la Vega : Good afternoon Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays: Earlier this quarter you folks mentioned that you\u2019ve been able to secure some financing for your handset receivables which I believe Randall had alluded to as an opportunity during your most recent analyst event. Now that we\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters with the Next program, do you see further opportunities to finance some of these receivables? And then secondly there has also been a lot of chatter around the possibility of extending bonus depreciation, John the scenario that you\u2019ve spent a decent amount of time looking at. But love to hear thoughts around where you think legislation is and where it ultimately shakes out and the potential opportunity here with respect to your sort of cash flow positioning? John Stephens : Sounds great, we are let me turn it Amir, first of all Citi was our lead bank in the Next monetization transaction that we completed in June. We received about $800 million in cash from the monetization of some of our Next accounts receivables. With that being said, we still had a net investment and are customers of $1.5 billion more than $1.5 billion actually from January 1st to June 30th. What we learn from that is, it wasn\u2019t just Citi, but it was a number of other banks stepped up and we\u2019re interested in joining in the contortion to buy those receivables there was plenty of demand. The financing costs were extremely low, very, very attractive and the terms and conditions were very attractive. So we went ahead and did it, we also, we are also very pleased with the fact that the collection of major banks established the real validity and the real value of those receivables. And we believe there continues to be great demand in fact all the participants and that have come back to us and said and asked us. So we\u2019ll get further opportunities that we believe that\u2019s one other reasons why I feel comfortable are, cash flow guidance for the year in the sense that we have that one of those levers is the monetization process. So it gives us great comfort. Second piece is we\u2019re optimistic on bonus depreciation giving at least extended, there has been a number of builds out there, some to make it permanent others to extend it. There seems to be a general sense that the extenders will get completed and approved, but maybe not until later this year. That would be a very good thing for capital intensive industry like us and help us continue to make significant investments in our network. The biggest cash impact for us would be in 2015. We would certainly help 2014, but the biggest cash impact for us would be in 2015, because of some of the new answers of tax rules. And we\u2019re we follow carefully and we\u2019re looking, we\u2019re looking for every opportunity to promote that legislation. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : That comes from Mike Rollinswtih with Citi Investment and Research. John Stephens : Hello mike. Mike Rollinswtih \u2013 Citi Investment and Research : Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-up if I could please. I think last quarter you mentioned what the installment net receivables were at the end of the quarter, I was wondering if you can give us an update there? And then secondly, if I can just go back to the churn improvement that you saw during the quarter, how should we think about who specifically the improvement came from, in other words did it come from customers that were had a contract and were able to churn but took advantage of the no-sub Mobile Share Value. Was it customers earlier in their life that may have churn prematurely or you were able to capture a benefit from this, a way to think about the segments of customers were you saw that churn savings? Thanks. John Stephens : I think the Mike couple of things, one I think the biggest churn improvements we saw over are quite frankly in smartphones in the overall category of smartphones where the smartphone churn is lower than that 0.86 postpaid churn we saw. Secondly, the customers who participate in our Mobile Share Value plan as they are churn is also lower than the 0.86%. So as those plans grow and as our smartphone, 80% smartphone base continues to go to flow share of 92% you can understand why we are optimistic about further kind of churn improvement and the opportunity we continue this good run we\u2019re having. Ralph de la Vega : Yes, Mike let me add a little more color to that, like John said when you compare the 1.02 churn to 0.86 that extends the life of a customer by a year and a half. If you do the same analysis not on the total base, but on smartphones that life extension goes to 2.5 years. The churn difference is actually greater if you compare smartphones on the same basis. So you extend the life of the customer by 2.5 years and then if you take smartphone who will have Mobile Share Value and Next you extend that even further than that. These results are early on, but are really encouraging and it\u2019s basically says that customers who choose Mobile Share Value and Next on smartphones are driving this thing down to really low levels. And by the way the numbers that we\u2019re quoting on churn are of course total churn there is some involuntary churn. So the voluntary churn numbers are actually even lower than the ones that we have just published. John Stephens : Mike, I will add to the sort of the installment sales, I would tell you it\u2019s a mix bag of numbers I don\u2019t want to, make sure I don\u2019t direct you to something one specific line of the financial statements. But if you look at our accounts receivable and then you add in our long-term assets that relate to Next, because some of the receivables are over 12 months. And then you look at the deferred purchase price from the city organization to get a sense where in the area of $3.2 billion of total receivables and that\u2019s after taking into account or reducing it for the \u2013 for the monetization we did. We will disclose this information in 10-Q. So I\u2019ll give you that back to say we will make sure we \u2013 as we have in the first quarter to disclose that. Susan Johnson : Next question. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan: Hey guys, thanks. I guess two quick ones, first the buyback pace is a little slower, should we think of that as sort of the new run rate given the DTV transaction out there and I know you said opportunistic, but that\u2019s I mean this at this level give or take? And then second speaking of DTV, there are lot of opportunities in Latin America AMX made some assets, the Brazil auction is coming up, would you anticipate being involved in anything in Latin America between now and the close of the DTV deal or in the future, or do you think of DTV sort of it is as it is for a while? Thanks. Ralph de la Vega : Phil real quick on the buyback, you\u2019re absolutely right the pace is moderated and certainly we take into consideration all factors the DTV deal, our CapEx spending, quite frankly our investment and our customers with Next. So I must stick with the guidance we gave before that, we are going to continue to be opportunistic, but you\u2019re absolutely right that the pace has moderated cash compared to last year. With regard to any transactions other than the comments I have made on the DTV, we really wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on any or comment on any speculation. So we were just \u2013 we were just really focused on continuing to work with the regulatory agencies in getting the DTV transaction approved and moving forward that and we still, we\u2019re more excited about it and more confident that\u2019s the right thing to do than ever and so we want to push it forward. John Stephens : Thank you. Susan Johnson : And Nick, I think we\u2019re going to call for the last question. Operator : Thank you. The last question will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thanks guys. I think last quarter you gave the normalized ARPU and maybe I missed at this quarter, if you normalize for the sale of the equipment. And maybe I know you have channel sales and a few other moving parts. Can you give us what your best guess and what the normalized revenue growth was for the quarter? And then lastly, I know you said customers are bring their own, more of their own devices, but are you seeing customers kind of trade down to lower cost devices with the next plan now that they have to kind of pay it for their own? Thanks. John Stephens : So, Tim a couple of things if you look on Slide 10 that we showed there, you can see that the ARPU plus the Next billings was about 64 little bit over $64, $64.35 that compares to last year $67 so it\u2019s down around the 4%, 4.5% range. Secondly I would tell you that if you look at that as of the month of June as opposed to the average for the quarter that\u2019s about a dollar higher. And so what we are seeing is an expectation that through the rest of this year you will see the ARPU plus those Next billings definitely increase and we\u2019ll be, we\u2019re very optimistic about the opportunity to get back on track for growth. Ralph take the question. Ralph de la Vega : Yes, and Tim what we\u2019re seeing today in terms of bring your own devices, devices that are typically hand me downs. But we\u2019re very excited, because we see a new wave of low cost smartphones where our customers can outright purchase the device for a very low cost and in essence bringing their own device by paying cash. And the new line up of smartphones that we\u2019ll have in the second half will have several options of good looking devices, very functional, large screen at lower cost that will allow a customer to get our best price by a very simple purchase of the device. So we think that the BYOD will probably increase as the year goes on. John Stephens : Well, for the quarter Tim our BYOD units were about three times or more than three times what they were last year. But the encouraging win for us is about three quarter or more of those, went on accounts under contract. And so the BYOD there is a required contract when they bring them put them out of the account that has a contract we feel real good about the sustainability of those and quite frankly as Ralph mentioned the fact there is no-subsidy cost those makes it really a financially attractive situation. As we close, I want to thank you all for being with us this afternoon. We\u2019ve made significant progress in transforming our business for growth in the second quarter and in particular with repositioning our wireless business model. Postpaid net adds were very strong. Specifically smartphones net adds were very strong and we had our best ever postpaid churn. And we\u2019ve made great strides in moving smartphone subscribers off the subsidy model. We feel really good about our current momentum heading into the back-half of the year and believe even stronger that our discussions to go with this model was appropriate. Thanks again for the call and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a great evening. Good night. Operator : With that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. And thank you for participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

I also want to remind you that we are in the quite period for FCC Spectrum Auction 97 and AWS-3 Auction so we cannot address any questions about Spectrum today. So with that overview, I now turn the call over to AT&Ts Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, John? John Stephens :  Thank you, Mike. And hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and we always appreciate your interest in AT&T. Before we report out on our quarterly results, I\u2019d like to update you on Project VIP in the longer term view of our business transformation. We\u2019ve been focused on building ultra fast, video centric networks and providing mobile connectivity to any device, anywhere our customers needed. I am pleased to say we have made great progress. It\u2019s been nearly two years since we first announced our VIP initiatives and our plans to transition to IP networks. Basically, we are doing everything we said we are going to do and more. We reached our 4G LTE build target in the third quarter four months ahead of schedule. The nation\u2019s most reliable LTE network now covers more than 300 million people. We continue to improve our self identity and add capacity to help keep our network best-in-class. We are also on pace with our wireline network goals. Our high-speed IT broadband network now reaches 57 million customer locations. About two thirds of our U-verse video footprint now has access to 45 megabit per second speeds. We also continue to make progress on expanding our U-verse video footprint and we committed to deploy ultra fast AT&T GigaPower service in 17 markets. Our fiber to the business expansion also is going strong. We now pass more than 600,000 new business customer locations with fiber, well on our way to our one million goal. The transformation of our customer base also continued in the quarter. Two years ago when we first introduced Project VIP less than half of our broadband customers had high speed IP broadband. Now a significant part of that transition is complete with nearly three quarters of our base on high speed U-verse broadband. And our strategic business services are on track to be nearly 30% total wireline business revenues by the end of this year. The transition in wireless is just as dramatic. There has been a steady shift of our subscribers to usage based plans; more than 80% of our smartphone base is now on usage-based plans. At the same time, mobile share value has helped move customers off the traditional subsidy model. We also have launched new business opportunities that will leverage our investment in a high speed networks. The connected car is ready to take off. In the third quarter alone we added more than 500,000 connected cars as the 2015 model start to roll off the assembly lines. Digital Life, the first all-digital all-IP home security and automation platform has launched in 82 markets and has about a 140,000 subscribers. And AT&T has completed a Network On Demand trial in Austin that will enable companies to easily order, add or change services on their own in mere real time. A commercial roll out of Network On Demand enabled Ethernet services is expected in Austin by the end of this year. Our financial strength allows us to invest while still returning substantial value to shareholders; in fact since 2012 we have returned more than $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Cash flows are strong and we have been aggressive in monetizing non-strategic assets. Including the sale of our Connecticut wireline property we have generated about 16 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales. This has helped us average nearly $20 billion a year in free cash flow and asset sales over the last two years and we expect to do the same this year in 2014. At the same time we\u2019ve kept our financial house in order by funding a pension plan, making significant working capital improvements and taking advantage of historically low interest rates. This is the heavy lifting our employees are doing everyday that you don\u2019t always notice in the quarterly numbers. We are just managing for the short term or managing and investing for the long term. Now with that view, let\u2019s take a look at third quarter results starting with our financial summary on slide four. Consolidated revenue grew to $33 billion up $800 million or 2.5% year-over-year. This was driven by continued wireless growth as we repositioned our business model, solid consumer wireline growth, once again led by U-verse and continued growth in strategic business services. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.58. In the quarter we had $0.03 of cost associated with merger and integration related expenses. We also redeemed some debt early in the quarter to take advantage of low interest rates; both reductions in cost had a $0.02 impact on the quarter. When you exclude these items earnings per share were $0.63 compared to an adjusted $0.66 a year earlier. Cash from operations continued at a strong rate and we also continue to find ways to monetize assets. Together, that has generated $32 billion in cash year-to-date. With year-to-date capital spending of $17 billion and about $7 billion paid in dividends so far this year. With all of that our cash position remains strong even as we continue to return substantial value to shareholders. Now let\u2019s turn to our operational highlights on Slide five. The third quarter was another solid step forward in the transformation of our business. This includes strong subscriber metrics in both wireless and wireline and continued growth in strategic business services. In wireless, we saw good in fact great trends in a challenging environment including more than 2 million net adds that included adding twice as many postpaid subscribers as we did in the year ago third quarter. Record low third quarter post paid churn, solid wireless revenue growth and improving adjusted service margins even with record third quarter smartphone gross adds and upgrades. We also saw the continued transition of our customer base to AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans while also realizing sequential ARPU phone growth. In wireline, U-verse hit some important subscriber milestones. We now have more than 12 million high speed broadband subscribers. The transition phase of moving our broadband base to IP is nearing completion with about 75% of our total broadband base on our higher speed service. And we also reached more than 6 million U-verse video subs that helped drive strong U-verse revenue growth and continued wire line consumer gains. U-verse is now a $15 billion annualized revenue stream growing at nearly 24%. In wireline business, strategic services growth continued at a strong pace. It\u2019s now a $10 billion annualized revenue stream growing at more than 14%. With those highlights, let\u2019s now drill down and take a look at our operating results starting with wireless. We had a great net add quarter. That\u2019s a trend we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the year. Overall we added more than 2 million total subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added nearly 800,000 new postpaid subscribers that\u2019s twice as many as the year ago quarter, about 450,000 of those were tablets and computing devices with the remaining net adds, phone and some digital life. And year-to-date we\u2019ve added more than 2.4 million postpaid subscribers which also doubled last year\u2019s pace. Another key point with our postpaid net adds is that we are adding these customers while maintaining high credit standards. These are rock solid high quality, new subscribers. These net adds exclude any migrations from our prepaid segment. Connected devices also had a strong quarter as we started to see significant impact of the connected car with nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter including more than half a million cars. Churn turned in another strong quarter, in fact it was our best ever third quarter postpaid churn that follows our best ever churn in the second quarter and churn from Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next customers is even lower. Total Churn for the quarter was up slightly to 1.3%, 1.36% reflecting a larger prepaid base with the March acquisition of Cricket. These are solid results in a challenging environment. We saw our competitive intensity pickup in an iPhone launch quarter with all major carriers now offering the iPhone and we expect that to continue as we move into the holiday sales period in the fourth quarter. But we believe strongly in the quality of our network, our award winning customer service and the value proposition we offer customers. Our results so far this year show we are on the right track and we are looking to finish the year strong. Now let\u2019s look at revenue and ARPU on slide seven. We continue to see a shift in wireless revenues as customers sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and away from the traditional subsidy model. Total wireless revenues for the quarter were up nearly 5%, service revenues were stable year-over-year and equivalent revenues were up more than 40%. A take rate for AT&T Next was about the same as last quarter, about half of gross adds and upgrades. We also saw an increasing number of subscribers bringing their own device to our network, about 460,000 or 7% of smartphone gross adds were bring your own device or BYOD. That\u2019s more than four times what we saw in the year ago third quarter and more than 1 million BYODs customers year-to-date. We continue to have a large base of customers on discounted Mobile Share Value plans who have yet to migrate to Next. About 20% of our smartphone base is on Next, but about 52% of smartphone subscribers are on the non subsidy pricing. This means that there are about 20 million potential Next customers we expect to upgrade, that\u2019s up from 17 million at the end of the second quarter. Next take rates continue to be strong in company-owned stores nearly all are more than 90% of our Mobile Share Value customers with pre Next pricing or choosing AT&T Next when they upgrade in company owned stores. They all come without a customer choice, customers can choose the plan that is best for them and that\u2019s great for us, and right now most customers are choosing to go off the subsidy mile when they upgrade or add a new line. Also in the quarter, we continue to see customer\u2019s buy up larger data plans and more interested in device insurance. This is helping drive revenue. Now let\u2019s look at postpaid ARPUs. The expected trends we talked about last quarter are happening as more customers take AT&T Next. Phone-only service ARPU is down year-over-year but up sequentially. When you add a Next doings you get a better view of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next billings improved sequentially by 2%. The average monthly Next billings were about $29 per month driving our ARPU with Next higher. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. We also continue to see strong growth in data billings, those details are on slide eight. Wireless data billings increased by nearly 24% in the quarter. This was due to the increasing number of devices on the network and customers choosing 10 gigabit plans or larger. More than half of all Mobile Share accounts are on these plans. During the quarter, we added more than 2 million Mobile Share accounts giving us 16.7 million in total, that\u2019s three times as many as we had a year ago. And we averaged about three connections per Mobile Share accounts or nearly 47 million connections in total. That\u2019s roughly 60% of our overall postpaid base. Smartphone sales continue to be strong; in fact, we had 6.9 million smartphone gross adds and upgrades. That\u2019s a third quarter record. And it would have been even higher without inventory constraints. We added $1.2 million subscribers to our smartphone base including about including 500,000 smartphone net adds. Most our sales continue to be smartphones, about 91% of the flow share. About two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base use LTE phones. As you know, LTE devices provide the best customer experience, while also being the most efficient on our networks. Let\u2019s now look at our wireline results, starting with consumer on slide nine. U-verse hit two subscriber milestones in a quarter. First, we now have more than 12 million high-speed broadband subscribers, after adding more than 600,000 in the quarter. U-verse broadband is now 73% of our total broadband base and 75% in the consumer broadband base, that\u2019s up 70% in the last two years, that\u2019s help to drive total postpaid \u2013 that help drive total positive broadband net adds in the quarter. We also continue to deploy our ultra high-speed GigaPower service. We now offer 1 gigabit speeds in Austin and have turned up the service in Dallas and Fort Worth. We\u2019ve also committed to deploy GigaPower in 14 additional markets including Houston, Miami and Atlanta. We also passed the 6 million mark with U-verse TV subscribers and in 216,000 in the quarter, and bundles continue to play a big role in our growth. More than 97% or virtually all of our video customers have some kind of bundle with us, most often broadband and video. And nearly two-thirds of U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us. ARPU for U-verse triple play customers continues to be more than $179 that helps drive revenue growth while reducing churn. In fact triple-play bundled customers have significantly lower churn than standalone customers. All this help drive 3% revenue growth in consumer, total U-verse revenues are now more than $15 billion annualized revenue stream and our continued growth at nearly 25% year-over-year. U-verse now represents 64% or nearly two-thirds of our consumer revenues. That compares to 54% just the year ago. Now let me take you to our wireline business results on slide 10. We also reached another significant milestone in the wireline business. Strategic business services, those are growth services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services are nearly a $10 billion annualized revenue stream for us now. The services backup more than 28% of business wireline revenue and grew by more than 14% in the third quarter. At our current growth rate strategic business services should be about 39% of business wireline revenues by the end of the year. Overall business revenues decline by 2% in the quarter. Service revenues were also down 2% year-over-year. The shift to IP data and away from legacy services, as well as the economy is the story in wireline business. But within the business there are some differences. Our retail service revenues actually grew year-over-year. Those are service revenues from an enterprise and small business. Enterprise revenues were up 1.7%, that it\u2019s best performance in years and the six consecutive quarter of service revenue growth. Small business trends also improve as even with a lack of new business formations. On the other hand, wholesale is again challenged by network grooming issue. We also make a strategic decision to refocus the wholesale business. That reduce wholesale revenue is about $50 million in the quarter and we expect that amount to increase in the fourth and thereafter. The positive trends in retail service revenues are encouraging, and as is the transition IP services from legacy product. But the economy and fewer business starts continue to make for a challenging environment and clearly call for the government to move toward actual form legislation. Now let\u2019s look at consolidated and wireline margins on slide 11. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.2% compared to 18.5% a year ago quarter. Wireless margins were pressured by strong adoption of mobile share value plans, solid customer growth, promotional activities and the leap acquisition. However, when compared to the year ago third quarter, adjusted wireless EBITDA service margins actually expanded to 4 to 3.1. As the solid performance given our strong postpaid and smartphones that adds, as well as record third quarter gross adds and upgrade. Wireline margins were pressured by increasing content costs and transformation expenses, lower legacy revenues also contributed to the pressure. But this pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, gains and strategic business services and solid execution or in cost initiatives. Now let\u2019s move to cash flow, our summaries on slide 12. In the first nine months of the year cash from operation totaled $25.6 billion and $8.7 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were 17 billion and $5.2 for the quarter. And free cash flow before dividends is $8.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the quarter. We did monetize about $500 million of Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions and additional tranches in the future are possible. Net dept to adjusted EBITDA was 1.7 and our credit rating continues to be among the best in the industry. In terms of uses of the cash, dividend payments year-to-date totaled $7.2 billion and we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program. Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and cash position, when you will include the $1.9 billion in short term investments, we had $4.3 billion of cash at the end of the third quarter. We also to expect to close the sale of our wireline asset in Connecticut and the Frontier this Friday, which will enhance our cash position with $2 billion in proceeds. Let me close with the quick summary of the quarter on slide 13. We continue to make progress with our business transformation in this quarter throughout this year. That includes the repositioning of our postpaid base of the subsidy model. Total share counts continue to grow and of our 57% of our gross adds and upgrades to the quarter were either AT&T next or BYOD. At the same time we continue to see strong total and postpaid net adds with low postpaid churn in a very challenging environment. We also continue to rationalize our business portfolio. This includes completing the sales of the Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil equity interest, closing Connecticut wirelines property transactions two months earlier than we had expected, and exiting select low margin wireline wholesale businesses. This rationalization as well the impact of more BYOD devices than we had expected and fewer net AT&T net gross adds and upgrades will impact revenues. The company now expects full year consolidated revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range. Even with this change we expect that Next rates will increase for the rest of the year and continued strong BYOD will help with margins even with traditional fourth quarter holiday pressure. So overall we continue to have confidence in our strategy and our ability to compete in this challenging environment. With that Tony, let\u2019s go at and take some questions. Operator : Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) The first will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies: Hey, guys. Thanks. John, you have made a lot of protective moves this year, obviously, and we\u2019re seeing phone-only ARPU stabilizing, but EBITDA has gone ex-growth. I guess just trying to think into 4Q, I'm assuming that the expectation clearly without subsidies is to see a decent number in year-over-year growth and EBITDA. And then just, as part of that, if you could identify what you\u2019re seeing out there with respect to recent data points from the iPhone with respect to sticker shock on this whole issue of people being concerned about layering EIP payments on top of the existing plan? Thanks. John Stephens : Thanks Mike, I appreciate your question. Now first of all on the sticker shock issue itself, quite frankly with 90% plus of the people come into our stores, we\u2019re not seeing \u2013 I won\u2019t say we haven\u2019t seen one or two, but we\u2019re not seeing any strong number at all of sticker shock, and the reality of it is for a person to come in and go to a subsidized model, they\u2019ve got to come up with $240 plus whatever taxes they have to pay. And if they stay on the Next model, they not only get the cheaper service on a monthly basis but the upfront costs are really only about $50. So, from a sticker shock it\u2019s much more positive to go on Next than it is to come up with that down payment for the subsidized phone. So we \u2013 and we\u2019re really aren\u2019t seeing that at all. On expectations for the fourth quarter, won\u2019t go into details, but as we\u2019ve said before we expect a significant improvement in margins, EBITDA service margins in the fourth quarter compared to prior years and we are still working towards achieving what we said in the past and that is all four quarters this year to be 40% EBITDA service margins or better. Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. Thanks John. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. John Stephens : Hey, John. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Hey. So my question is on the improvement on the ARPU side. John, could you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are of the sequential improvement we saw in phone ARPU and the improvement we saw in the postpaid ARPU? And then, as it relates to the pre-Next program, it looks like you went from 17 to 20 in the quarter to real slowdown. Have you guys repositioned the basis as much as you think is necessary or are we going to see that reaccelerate in the fourth quarter? Thanks. John Stephens : Great. So, on the ARPU story, I think the biggest issue with the improvement is really the people buying the bigger buckets and buying \u2013 upping plans, as we\u2019ve mentioned. We had over 50% of the customer base at the 10-gig or bigger plans. We believe that that is really helping on the ARPU side. We still have \u2013 we still expect more customers to migrate to the Mobile Share Value plans, so we may still see some more pressure from the existing customers on that ARPU side, but buying the bigger bucket is definitely helping. Secondly, on the Next take rates, the two uniqueness of the quarter -- two items that are unique this quarter, were one, the significant BYOD and while those 400,000 plus BYOD devices really don\u2019t bring us much if anything in the revenue and caused an adjustment in our thoughts on revenue they don\u2019t bring any expense either. And so we\u2019ll take those every time we can get them. That seemed to have an impact on the Next take rate. The other issue is where inventory was available in the launch month, which was September where customers have a much higher experience, better experience going to Next in a company owned stores. But in the launch cycle sometimes inventory was constrained, so people would go into different locations where our experience level in Next hasn\u2019t been as high, particularly in some of the new channels like some of the big-box stores or some of the manufacturer stores. So, we\u2019d expect that to get to those higher levels over time, so we do expect the rate to increase. It\u2019s just going to take a little longer time than we had expected. John Hodulik \u2013 UBS: All right. Thanks John Stephens : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to clarify the postpaid net add estimate did not include internal migrations from prepaid. And then, to what extent did you see prepaid migrations to postpaid may be coming from your peers and have you made any changes to your credit standards? John Stephens : So a couple of things, we haven\u2019t made a changes to our credit standards in any way shape or performance that will be significant or any change, that would change any traffic. Secondly, we do not count any migrations from for example our Cricket product into our AT&T product. Those will be excluded not only for phones but for tablets, that\u2019s how we count or have ever counted that information. I can\u2019t comment necessarily give you lot of significant information with regard to any change in the migration from the customers that are porting into us whether they were previously prepaid or postpaid customer of the other carriers. I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 and what I mean to mean to say by that is, I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to indicate that there\u2019s any significant change in that. I am not aware of that, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will from come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank a lot. Good evening. John, are you still committed to the $21 billion capital spending guidance? [You imply just] [ph] a $4 billion number for the fourth quarter. And how are we thinking about that for -- is $21 billion still a good number for 2015 under VIP? And then on wireline margins, you talked about some of the content costs, some of the transformation costs. When do we see those margins start to stabilize? Thanks. John Stephens : Simon, we are still committed to the $21 billion [range] [ph] for 2014 which is the guidance we\u2019ve been giving, so that gives us some room possibly 21.5 down and $20.5 somewhere in that, so that\u2019s I would suggest is a range, but yes we\u2019re still committed to that. Yes, we expect that to be further step down to capital spending in the fourth quarter that was planned. If people are wondering how that might accomplished, I will tell you that if you look at what the network team has accomplished with regard to getting 300 million POPs with LTE coverage and getting 600 million business locations passed with fiber, getting 57 million customer locations passed with IP broadband capabilities. We are ahead of the game so to speak in what we laid out and so there\u2019s a real opportunity to manage capital in that way and still continue to meet our target. It\u2019s a benefit of being ahead of the game on some of the build. With regard to 2015, I won\u2019t give any additional guidance. I will specifically give - additional guidance we\u2019ll give that in January and update our guidance like we normally do. I will suggest you this though, we still expect tax extenders to get passed in the post-election session of Congress and those to get signed. If that doesn\u2019t get signed, I would suggest you the companies, all companies, will have to take into account that change in their ability to invest because it\u2019s a financial change in their balance sheet and their cash flow statement. And that would be for us it would definitely be taken into account and what we decide on our investments next year. But quite frankly, I think many companies it would have an immediate impact if it\u2019s not passed on their March or their first quarter tax return payments for this year and that might add a little more immediate impact on capital spending by other parties. My point here is I think tax reforms, specifically tax extenders, needs to be completed. With regard to wireless margins, two pieces to that story and there certainly is the content piece and we\u2019ve got a strategic resolution or opportunity to make improvements on that. But secondly on our transformation piece, as you heard in our presentation, 75% of our DSL customers have converted to high-speed broadband products and we\u2019ve converted significant number of feature phones to smartphones, all of this conversion going on. In the wireline space that conversions had a lot of costs. Those costs are getting behind us now. When you have 75% of the base on high-speed, you\u2019ve incurred those costs. So that gives us an opportunity to improve margins going forward. And we\u2019ll tell you there is second transformation going on and that\u2019s how we serve our customers. How we take orders. How we provision and \u2013 how we validate those orders. How we provision them. How we activate service. We are actively working on mechanizing that ordering process, mechanizing that validation, that provisioning planning process. Those network is not yet completed. We\u2019ve made a lot of great traction, but that will certainly continue on into next year. And once we have that complete those two pieces of our transition cost will be behind us and that will give us the opportunity to really grow margins. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to. Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. John Stephens : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : . Thanks a lot. Just a follow-up here. You talk about an expectation that your Next take rate is likely to increase into the fourth quarter, after kind of stabilizing in 3Q. I just want to clarify, is that because you are putting more emphasis on that in the channel or are you seeing something else that\u2019s driving it? And then just in terms of other sort of margin drivers into the fourth quarter, can you give us some thoughts on where you think we're going to see the upgrade rate come out? John Stephens : Yes. Brett, let me give you the simplest answer I can with regard to the Next rate improving. Our stores in September had some shortages on inventory where customers went -- our customers went and bought inventory from channels. Our stores our company-owned stores have the highest performance of Next take rate. So now that those inventory constraints we\u2019re expecting to get behind us. They\u2019re not quite there yet, but we expect them to get behind us, we\u2019ll back to more normal sharing of that. That\u2019s the first reason. Second reason is, as we rolled up in Next program in the manufacturer stores and in the national retailer stores, there\u2019s learning curve and we are going through that and as we go through the learning curve the Next take rate of those operation has been improving. Those are the two reasons why we think that the overall take rate can improve. Any time we have a launch of a new device in a month, it challenges a lot of pieces of your operations. In this case it challenged our Next take rates. With regard to margin activities, we\u2019re going to have the -- we continue to have the focus on expense management across the enterprise, but I think you probably know that with regard to percentages on upgrade rates we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on that and I wouldn\u2019t suggest there would be any differences one way or the other they need to have in a fourth quarter holiday season with a new product launch out there. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. John Stephens : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan: Hey, guys, thanks. I guess a couple of housekeeping things. One, can you reiterate or not the $11 billion in free cash flow and your EPS guidance that you'd given earlier in the year? And then, second, just following up on Brett's question on the Next mix, given the -- what I think is a tougher credit requirement and the limits on distribution, how big of a mix on gross adds could this be, do you think? Is there an upper limit around 75 or 80 that this doesn't go above? Thanks John Stephens : So, Phil, we\u2019re not changing guidance with regard to EPS or free cash flow. We\u2019re still in that $1 billion range. We\u2019re still \u2013 I think what I said before is the low end of the mid single-digit EPS range. The only caveat I give to that is if we continue to have quarters where we add 2 million customer, we\u2019re not going to turn down the opportunity of 2 million postpaid customers or the kind of wireline growth we\u2019ve had in a strategic services, we\u2019re not going to turn that down just to make a goal that the finance guys may have set. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for the business, but sticking by what we said before. With regard to the Next take rates, I think you hit on the right point in the sense of there is always going to be credit scoring impact on the availability or the qualification of our customers. So there always be some customers who would be better suited of our other arrangements or another products. We welcome them. We love to have them. But we\u2019re not likely to go with the Next program for them. Secondly and I think as importantly is customers just want to have choice and so we will look to make sure that they have a choice if they want to use the Next program. That\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll another opportunity for them. With that being said, we certainly expect that with this Mobile Share Value pricing going to two-thirds of our base by the end of the year that there is significantly step up in the number of Next customers compared to what we have today. Whether that all occurs in the fourth quarter or some of that occurs in 2015, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but either way it still a good long-term investment for us and we believe a good long-term situation for our customers. Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan: Got it. Thanks, John. John Stephens : Thank you, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo : Thank you for taking the question. John, I just wanted to explore the SMB. You realized some significant bucking of what I would think would be a different trend, just because all our checks show that the cable guys have been nothing short of aggressive. Can you talk a little bit of what you are seeing or what you're doing differently there to -- or is it just macro? Are you leading on wireless, et cetera? John Stephens : Kind of all the above Jennifer, I am glad to the call. A couple of things, one, we\u2019re putting a lot of fiber and a fiber whether you think about U-verse fiber and then U-verse fiber where many people think is consumer also can be available for business, but also the fiber that\u2019s passing those business locations. We are finding that that fiber is enabling us to really go in and not only reinforce our customer position with existing customers but be very competitive in offering services to new customers. Talking about your strategic services piece in the small business is growing healthfully. It\u2019s not a big base as of today, but it is growing well and the customer seems to like those services and are willing to take them. So the investments we\u2019ve made in the IP are starting to pay off. Lastly, you hit the nail on the head and this is what we\u2019ve done on an organization perspective. It works for small business as well large business, but the ability to be agnostic with regard to the services of whether it\u2019s wired or wireless or more important the ability to combine wired and wireless services for you customers through one organization has proven to be really powerful even in small business. And so that\u2019s how we think we\u2019re bucking the trend of no business starts but we got a long way to go and we need to keep the team\u2019s performing well but we need to keep it up and keep it moving forward, we are not making any declarations now but we do have a better feel for the situation than we did few quarters ago. Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden - Bank of America : Hey thanks guys. I appreciate letting me ask some questions. So the first question would be on the enterprise side. Your biggest competitor talked about what sounded like were some structural things going on in the industry on private line pricing, core connectivity pricing, and it doesn't seem to have been an issue for you guys in the quarter. So I was wondering if you guys could give us a sense as to your comfort level on the enterprise positive trajectory. Then the second was obviously the payoff from the forward pricing initiative has been the lower churn that you have been posting up. Are you comfortable letting people look at kind of a 10 to 15 basis point year-over-year churn improvement be the new run rate baseline expectation on a go-forward basis? Thanks John Stephens :  Well thanks, David. A couple of things, one, I go to tell you the performance enterprise has to do with our people, has to do with our enterprise sales team, both on a wire and the wireless side and the performance are now what provides our largest customers. I have the opportunity of meeting with about ten of our largest customers a few weeks ago in New York and I can tell you that they are satisfied with the kind of service, the quality, the security offerings those strategic services. So we are hard at work to continue the good progress we\u2019ve made and I have decided that it is a tough environment -- very hard to continue in and our advantage is our wired network and capabilities as well as the ability to bind with wireless. On the payoff in lower churn we\u2019ve certainly seen that payoff in lower churn we are not ready to establish a standard for that mainly to get through a full year because of this process before we even start formulating those numbers, but if you will two quarters in a row of best ever churn and year-to-date best ever churn. And those churn numbers of the postpaid side all below all the two digit range, range is very encouraging, but we got to be careful to continue to work hard and move this company forward. It\u2019s a long process of transformation that we\u2019re going through and we are nearing completion but we want to make sure we finish it very strong. So I\u2019ll leave out the predictions on rates. David Barden - Bank of America : Okay. Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays: Thank you very much and good afternoon folks. John Stephens : Hi Amir, how are you? Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays: Doing well, John. Seems to be some interesting buzz among the supplier community around the supplier Domain 2.0 initiative. Wanted to see if there was any updates from you folks on this front in terms of developments. And also, timing to some of your earlier commentary on CapEx trajectory. In other words, what you have seen so far, does that solidify some of your thoughts on the ability to drive down CapEx intensity in terms of your expenditures in some of the out years, John? John Stephens : We continue to be optimistic on our software directed networks or network-on-demand trial in Austin, just this last few months has grown positive or excited about the opportunity to get a launch in Austin of a product on an Ethernet basis that is what we call network-on-demand. So those things are real. It may take time to implement and to do right and the team is striving to do it right, but we remain optimistic. With regard to the software-directed networks and the ability to use that to manage and harnessing our capital cost. We continue to remain positive. We take that into account in our spending projections in our assets. I would suggest you though it is a not a short road, but a long road when you have a company that has $100 billion of net, property, equipment that you are managing and networks that have a significant history to them. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we remain positive and optimistic and yes, we are receiving savings or achieving value from those software directed networks and we hope to increase those amounts overtime. Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays: Great. Thank you very much for the additional color. Operator Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, two quick ones, if I may. So the bring your own device trend seems very positive. I'm just wondering, how do you deal with bring your own device customers coming over from CDMA? Do you give them a new handset or are all those coming from just T-Mobile? Then, secondly, I didn't quite understand your comment on the impact of bring your own device customers on the Next take rate. I would have assumed all of those customers would take Next -- would take the Next pricing. That would be what would be most attractive to them. If that's not the case, then I'm not sure why it would have impacted your revenue growth for the year. Thanks. John Stephens : Okay, quickly speaking on the BYOD device, these devices are coming not only from competitors who operate similar networks or whose devices will operate on their network which maybe more than one competitor whose devices may actually work in our networks. But they also come from devices that are previously one end of the door and we are less at home and then these are handed down either to family or friends, neighbors or whatever the case maybe, people they buy them over eBay and bring them and have already paid from. So they come from a variety of sources, they could be reusing devices that had previously formed through our networks. That\u2019s the first case. The second case is if those phones would have been sold by us, we would have had a \u2013 we are depending upon what the device cost a $500 of revenues and $500 of cost. It wouldn\u2019t have provided any margin, it wouldn\u2019t have provided any contribution but it would have provided revenue. So we still are getting our customer adds and we are getting a efficiency with the re-use of devices, we\u2019re just not getting any revenue out of them and that is quite frankly a big piece when we are talking about over a million devices so far and choose your number on how much revenue we will get out of each one of those devices. You can understand the impact it could have even on a company of our size as revenue. So that\u2019s the point there. We would have assumed that those kinds of devices people would have come in and gotten Next. Secondly, I would tell you we are making a distinction here. These BYOD devices aren\u2019t getting the Mobile Share Value plans and generally speaking, they are getting the lower price service because they are bringing the device. They just are not getting Next because they don\u2019t have to pay for a phone. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research :  Got it. Okay thanks John I appreciate it. John Stephens : No problem. Thank you. Michael Viola : Hey Tony, this will be our last question. Operator : Okay, thank you sir. And that will come from Michael Rollinswtih with Citi. Please go ahead. Mike Rollins - Citi Investment and Research : Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, as we think about your move to consumption-based pricing and we also think about some of the changes in the sizes of the buckets for data, can you give us a sense of what's happening as you increase the data buckets, you try to encourage customers to spend more on data? Are you getting more in data revenue relative to those that might have started at a higher plan and can use the same amount, but moved to a cheaper bucket? Then the second question is if you just had an update on the regulatory process with the DIRECTV deal. I think the FCC put out an update on their clock today, and I am just curious if you could talk about the implications of that and any update from your perspective. Thanks John Stephens : Sure on the data bucket I am referring back to the slide that we showed with regard to data billings and that they were up, of about 3.4% year-over-year. So what we\u2019re seeing in this opportunity is this that we are buying off particularly with the Mobile Shave Value plan or try to get the 10 meg buckets so there are 10 gig buckets excuse me with buying up anyway. And then you got to have some impact in some cases on average rates and so forth, but quite frankly about the customer experience comes out of having these bigger buckets also. Additionally, and probably it\u2019s supporting us anything, when they buy those data buckets they are adding things. They are going to add tablets, they are going to add variables, they are going to add other devices. Soon we have no adding connected cars and so what we \u2013 add other family phones or other members of the family tablets. And so what you see is they buy up these buckets and then they start using, I mean getting more functionality and then they are more tied to us. If you look at our Mobile Share Value accounts, I think we have about 16.5 million almost 17 million and we have about 47 or 48 million devices or connections on them. So these data buckets and that\u2019s what happening its helping us get pretty sticky with the customers and that\u2019s how we feel. The data billings increased almost over 20% is clearly what we point to you to say what\u2019s going on with the data side. With regard to the DIRECTV the FCC didn\u2019t make a decision today to stop the clock that decision has nothing to do with the merits of our deal or any information that we\u2019ve provided. The FCC is automated clear that there was concern about the confidentiality of the information that sometimes when companies provide the FCC and they are trying to deal with those issues. We are confident in the FCC rigorous procedures for keeping the information confidential and we\u2019re ready to provide them with the information they have requested from us. While the FCC is stopping the clock on merger review is fairly common, that today\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t change our view that we\u2019ll be able to get the deal approved and closed by the first half, in the first half of 2015. So Mike that\u2019s the color I would give you around that. We\u2019re still optimistic about the transaction. The stopping of the clock is not an uncommon or rare experience and it has something to do with other issues than the benefit of our deal or the merits of our deal. So we\u2019ll continue to support the process and look forward to getting the transaction closed within that originally announced one year kind of time frame. Mike Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment and Research : Thank you. John Stephens : Before we close, I want to thank all of you for being with us this afternoon. As you can tell we have continued to make significant progress in transforming our business not only in the third quarter but all year long that now includes repositioning our postpaid base of the subsidy rattle but we\u2019ve also did that while having strong net adds, strong postpaid gains and record levels of churn. We also had a strong performance in wireline with continued strong performance in new version strategic business services and our ability to combine our wired and wireless services for our customers benefit. We look to continue that solid momentum into the fourth quarter and finish the year strong. Once again thank you for being on the call. As always we thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a great evening. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the AT&T Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and then later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions).And I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for AT&T Mr. Michael Viola. Please go ahead sir. Michael Viola : Thank you, Lorry and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. As Lorry said I\u2019m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stephens, Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide some opening comments then close with 2015 guidance, John will cover our results and then we\u2019ll follow that with a Q&A. Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. Please call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. As such they are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially. And additional information is available on our Forms 8-K, other SEC filings and on the investor relations page of AT&T\u2019s website. I also want to remind you that we are still in the quite period for FCC Spectrum Auction 97 or the AWS-3 Auction so we cannot address any questions about Spectrum today. So with that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&Ts Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Hey Mike. Thanks and good afternoon. Fighting cold around here Lorry may end up having to handle this call for us. But before John takes you through the results I want to take just take a couple of minutes and frame where we are. 2012 to 2014 was a really period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this period we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people, we expanded our U-verse broadband footprint to 57 million customer locations and we deployed fiber to 725,000 business locations. And at the same time we reengineered our mobile network and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S.  Now at the same time we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall and you can see that by our record low annual postpaid churn rate. And we also delivered our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of 2014 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP based platforms and our strategic IP based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and it's growing 14% when you adjust it for the Kinetica sale. And that brings us to 2015, because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic investments announced to-date the ground work's now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today our customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms whether it's traditional linear video or over the top on U-verse broadband or video to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that. DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product and it brings us the best content relationships in the industry.  Our fixed broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And in the Cricket acquisition it\u2019s proven to be a cost effective way to strengthen our spectrum portfolio which is a prerequisite for in the mobile video delivery business. We also laid the ground word for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed the demand for the mobile internet and economic benefit experienced in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. And so with that we have been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key market for the regulatory in the investment climate is right.  And used cell and net cell international\u2019s Mexico give us this opportunity. The changes in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new entrant to invest and we close on use of sale and then once we complete Next sale we will have a very deep spectrum portfolio and this is the first element needed for a robust mobile internet offering.  We will now have the ability to expand our U.S. network directly into Mexico building one seamless network that's spanning 400 million people. And whether it\u2019s cross border businesses, Latino customers and either Cricket or AT&T or Mexican consumers we will be the only company with mobile internet capabilities spanning both counties. And don\u2019t forget DIRECTV brings the premier video business in Latin America.  So the bi-product of this is represented on Slide 5, you go 12 months now AT&T\u2019s revenue is going to look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. And when in 2015 post DIRECTV our revenues will come from four areas, our largest will be business solutions, that includes both fixed and wireless services and is growing nicely in fact in the fourth quarter that area is growing nearly 6%. The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband business, then third will be our consumer mobility business, then obviously our Latin American businesses where satellite TV and then the Mexican mobility businesses will be our fastest growing area. And we like this mix a lot, and by the end of the year we are going to be uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed connectivity dominated by video and is going to be a very different business.  So, with that I am going to turn it over to you John to go through 2014. John Stephens : Thank you Ran and hello everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 6. We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our sale of our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wireless growth as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to gains in the Strategic Business Services and U-verse.  For the full year we saw adjusted consolidated revenue grow by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77 however when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That\u2019s up nearly 4% from a year-ago. And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested America Movil interest, that percentage would be closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a $0.06 impact from the sale of our America Movil investment. These adjustments include $0.94 of non-cash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost a reverse of last year when we had a strong mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate but was partially offset by strong performance of our benefit plan investments. We also had a $0.25 non-cash pressure from the write-off of certain network assets which we told you about earlier this month. And we had $0.13 of cost associated with wireless integration, DIRECTV transaction cost and the loss on the sale of the Connecticut properties. Now let\u2019s turn to our operational highlights starting with wireless on Slide 7. Before I get to the quarter, it\u2019s important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business. It\u2019s been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next.  Since that time the results have been dramatic. First, we've had nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That\u2019s our best full year gain in five years. And this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These postpaid gains along with an end of year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the connected car, helped to drive 5.6 million total net adds. Our strongest growth in three years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high value high quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers.  At the same time, we had our best ever full year postpaid churn. That\u2019s a remarkable achievement anytime, but even more so when you consider the intense competitive environment we face during the year.  We also had our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are on equipment installment plans and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A repositioning of the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on mobile share plans. Now let\u2019s look at fourth quarter results starting on Slide 8. Let\u2019s begin with net adds where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 850,000 postpaid subscribers thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phone subscribers, but we also grew high quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter. This includes upgrades and migrations which we don\u2019t include in our net add number. Connected devices also continued their strong growth as the Internet things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter including 800,000 connected cars.  Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter however the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the pre-acquisition a year-ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong, distribution\u2019s been expanded, churn is improving and now nearly three quarters of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network. Our fourth quarter\u2019s is traditionally a strong sales quarter and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and upgrades, with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commit to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded 11% in the quarter. Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter. As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it\u2019s no surprise to see churn at these levels. But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to two years ago, the last time a fully refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter.  Now let\u2019s look at revenue gains on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues grew nearly 8% as the revenue mix shift we have seen throughout the year continue to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth tapped 70% with strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured as customers continue to sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model.  We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers and about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10 gigabytes or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago. And we\u2019re seeing a move to even bigger larger data plans, nearly 20% are on plans of 15 gigs or more. That\u2019s three times more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data billings. The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to make. We also had about 400,000 customers who bring their own devices onto our network.  The next take rate was a step-up from prior quarters, while we continue to see strong customer response at our company owned stores and agents with a Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our other retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans and our sales show that, plus with a rush of the holiday season, sales personnel with these retailers don\u2019t always have the time to take the steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We will continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate at those locations to pick up in the future.  As expected the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. When you add in Next billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us every month. Our average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24-month plan. As the Next pace grows so does the impact of billings nearly 27% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next.  Now let`s move to our wireline operations on slide 10. The transformation of our wireline networks IP technology has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. We say it again has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Kinetica operations. We're really seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business services and the U-verse.  Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now about two-thirds of consumer revenues. And strategic business service revenues grew by more than 14% and are now 30% of total wireline business revenues. Growth looks even stronger when you adjust out the impact of foreign exchange. Overall adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%, adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. However if you adjust for the effect of discontinued Global Hubbing businesses and foreign exchange that decline would have been just about a 0.5%.  We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy. But enterprise revenues were up slightly. However the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results helped drive a sequential improvement in wireline margins which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent years when we had seen sequential declines between the third and fourth quarter.  U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high speed broadband subscribers and now added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high speed broadband subscribers or more than three quarters of our broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for entire wireline team. U-verse CD subscriber net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our wireline consumer business. With our high content costs we targeted profitable, long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share.  Now let's take a look at margins on slide 11. We will start with our wireless margins. Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment related expenses and wireless integration costs. We mentioned earlier that we had our best ever full year adjusted service margins even with record sales thanks to AT&T Next. We also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly when compared to a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you compare the results to two years ago when smartphone sales were comparable service margins improved over 700 basis points.  Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat or down between the third and fourth quarter but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost but this was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives. For the quarter our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2% compared to 15.5% a year ago quarter and just under 13% two years ago. Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped offset some of that pressure.  Now let's move to cash flow [indiscernible] on slide 12. For 2014 cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter and free cash flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back overtime. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales price mix made an impact as well.  This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our best customers, we have the lowest churn and higher ARPU and that is our focus.  At the same time our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are high quality receivables we did monetize 1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest for financial institutions and we do expect future sales of those receivables.  Also in the fourth quarter we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and cash position. In fact we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of 2014. We had more than 3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year.  In terms of usage of cash dividends sold of 9.6 billion for the year and we continue to have one of the strongest yields around. We also announced the dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the dividend that puts us on a small and select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our dividend, saying that dividend is important to us is another statement we consider the very important aspect of our shareholder return and are committed to it.  At the same time we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt to adjusted-EBITDA was at 1.75. And as we told you at the end of the last year the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, but I suspect that with pending investments in the near-term we may go over our 1.8 times net debt to EBITDA target. Also as we told you earlier, after we closed the DIRECTV transaction our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt. That\u2019s a look of fourth quarter end of 2014 I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015 outlook. Randall Stephenson : Okay, thanks John. We are going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we closed the DIRECTV transaction and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. Let me frame for you what you can expect from us this year, and I am going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis, that is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions. What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth, our adjusted-EPS growth will be in the low single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage.  I think capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we got earlier and that\u2019s thanks for the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives. Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I would want to note is that, we now expect to achieve ever higher multiyear synergies than we had communicated and anticipated we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV we anticipate no delusion to our adjusted-EPS, meaning our adjusted-EPS growth including Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single-digit range. We would like to 2015 a very different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll have a unique capability to integrate solutions across the diversified base of customers, geographies and technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure and we will have a path to profitable TV growth. And we'll have a nice set of growing Latin American businesses positioned well in video and the mobile internet.  So that\u2019s where we are focused for 2015 and beyond. We are very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. And so with that Lorrie I think we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Couple of strategic questions for Randall if I could. First Randall you\u2019ve been able to put together a Mexican strategy at a very reasonable cost. Is that how we should expect in terms of Mexico given the expectation that AMX is going to spitting off a large piece of their business over the next year or so. And then if you could expand that you also have a large footprint now in South America, especially Brazil, what are your thoughts on that market? And then maybe the same for Canada, you talked in a recent release about a North American calling market. If you could comment on your view on the attractiveness of those markets, that would be great. Randall Stephenson : Sure John, thanks. I will start with your question on Mexico. And the American Movil asset sale has been one of those things floating out there, nobody really yet knows what that\u2019s going to look like. And for us if we wanted to move into Mexico there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what was going to be required by American Movil to sell their assets seemed like an uncertain process. So we pursued use to sell and then with the Nextel Mexico assets what we have here is a set of assets, a spectrum portfolio that is really a robust spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that will be a very nice place to start in a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, where our America Movil sales assets are not and so that\u2019s what we try to do is chart a path that that would get us into Mexico and get us a platform that would sustain itself. And we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico and to go and compete aggressively and take share, so feel good about the assets we\u2019ve got.  On South America and Brazil, it\u2019s too early to say John. What we have down there is the best pay-TV business in Latin America and it\u2019s a business that continues to grow. It\u2019s got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very nice job of assembling some nice spectrum in various Latin American markets where they\u2019re doing a fixed wireless type solution for broadband, so there are number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product and their brand is strong enough that where they do that they have really-really good success. And so we\u2019re actually anxious to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin America and it is, it\u2019s a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we\u2019re excited about getting it. On Canada, I think right now we have about as much as we as a company can handle, we\u2019re not prepared to start talking about going north of the border right now. We\u2019ve got a lot to execute on the DIRECTV, get the deal approved and then we\u2019ve got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on and then obviously building out Mexico is going to be a full core press for the next couple of years. So we\u2019ve got more than we can chew. We\u2019ve bitten off more than we can chew right now and you\u2019ll see us focused on what we\u2019ve consummated to-date. Operator : We got to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Randall, I guess just following on, you started off the conversation with the discussion around revenue diversification. What is your thought, just as you look at the US wireless landscape into 2015, with respect to how bad can it get from here, with respect to pricing and promotion. From AT&T's standpoint, is share loss okay? Are you willing to accept sort of lower-end share loss? And then maybe one for John, just thinking about free cash flow into 2015, if we ex-out DTV and the acquisitions, just if you could frame out the moving parts there to give us a little more comfort on the dividend payout. And also maybe just a comment on whether or not you have talked to ratings agencies about the appetite for how high leverage could go? Randall Stephenson : Yes Mike. In terms of the wireless business, when you look at 2014 there\u2019s some aggressive pricing in the marketplace, but John I thought did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter 2012, there were three competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace that was the last time there was a major iPhone launch. And our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012 and this quarter there were everybody in the market had an iPhone and so the churn rates in the fourth quarter relative to what we've seen in the past were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very robust pricing environment we had our lowest churn rates ever.  Now as we move forward what we\u2019re really going to be focused on is the smartphone base. You\u2019re going to see us continue to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself. And you\u2019re going to really see us focused more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you\u2019re seeing how we\u2019re laying out what our segmentation -- of what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015. And we\u2019ve had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that with VPN solutions or security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening, that when you put those two areas together, we\u2019ll not put the two together, but when you look at our enterprise business segment both fix line and wireless combined, it\u2019s growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment -- that segment of customers churns lower than any other segment in the marketplace. It is price competitive, but it\u2019s interesting when you bundle it with VPN and other product sets, if you have a very-very nice business that grows very nicely and as John showed we\u2019re expanding margins as well. So we\u2019re really focused on the high end customer base.  The area where we\u2019re seeing a lot more pressure in the market is in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base and so that\u2019s what Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us address that into the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid product and as John pointed out in his comments Cricket we\u2019re getting to the transition and it is now growing our prepaid base is growing that customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we\u2019re doing in Mexico, we\u2019re looking forward to taking advantage of the Mexico footprint to with Cricket and as you noticed in the last week we've announced that pre-unlimited calling from the U.S to Mexico and you will see more and more of those offers materialize going the other way as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network. John Stephens : So, Mike this is John and with regard to free cash flow let me frame it up this way. As you know we've announced -- we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in the CapEx or improvement in free cash flow, that's step one.  Step two is with all our free cash flow -- with all our CapEx spending and investment there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our CapEx we'll see a reduction to that trailing expense that will not only help us with margins but will also help us with free cash flow. So those are two major steps.  The third one is we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested in them but we have a portfolio of those that we will be able securitize this year and we will see some turnaround and payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized, so we're optimistic about that.  That will be pressured, those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next, so we may reinvest some of those Next dollars that we [indiscernible] this year, we may reinvest in our customer base, we will make those judgments as we go. And then we will see some increase in taxes but not significant but we will likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said we're very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned.  We carefully talked to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect we will see some -- they have made some announcements on their own and I am sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year and the final VTV integration plans that we have they will come out and make their viewpoint shown. But those -- and I would tell you those conversations have been productive and constructive but they are well understanding our strategies and our approach. Mike McCormack : John, I guess without the crystal ball, but thinking about the phone on the ARPU level, is there a level of penetration of the value plans inside your base where we should start to see that more stable? I know in the past, you talked about maybe stability as we get into 2015 on various moving parts. But I guess just isolating phone-only ARPU, getting a sense for when that might be more stable? John Stephens : Yes, so Mike as you know on the phone-only ARPU when I think about that I think a phone-only ARPU plus our Next billings and if you look at that then sequentially they grew. And the difference between the historical service ARPUs and the service ARPUs plus Next billings that gap has been closing. You guys can figure out the math but quite correctly when you sell almost 6 million phones in the fourth quarter on Next and you start billing those for the entire first quarter and throughout next year on a $28 or $30 a month basis you can understand our optimism about improving ARPU's as we define those and remember we are fine that way because that's what the customer is paying in cash every month.  So we feel real good about where we're going and the where the process is, we're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to when ARPU plus Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior year quarter. But we look forward to getting through this year and continuing the progress especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team did an outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program. Operator : Next we will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : I guess the couple of things I want to hit -- one, if you could just clarify guidance. Is guidance to revenue and EPS growth, really just if we pull Connecticut out 2014, and, if so, what are the base revenue and EPS numbers? John Stephens : Yes. Maybe -- we'll pull out Connecticut as you said we're not giving detailed analysis of the product line or sub products but your assumption Phil that it is without Connecticut is correct that is the base line. Phil Cusick : Okay. Thanks, John. And then second, if you could talk about Next, 58% in the fourth quarter. What's going on in distribution? Are you going to expand that further? And do you expect a working capital drag in 2015 to be larger or smaller than 2014? John Stephens : Yes. So the Next sales go like this, in our company owned stores, in authorizations great performance more than 80% nearly 90% as we mentioned, great take rate in a busy fourth quarter. Quite frankly on the large national retailers and the manufacturer owns retail stores the take rates were smaller but in the fourth quarter they had a lot of activity for us, they sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion of fourth quarter because of the holiday season than any other quarter. And so we're optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall through the year and we're also optimistic about working with the national retailers and the other retailers to provide them additional support on how to sell Next and how it works.  So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we will get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next plus bring our own device. So we are really moving directly out of the subsidy business, that\u2019s a good thing long-term and short-term. With regard to the -- if free cash flow impacts will have the flexibility to monetize, we expect to have the flexibility to continue to monetize large blocks in these securitizations, it's worked very well. The banks continue to have very much interest. And as we stated before we want to continue a regular pattern of doing this so that we build the history for this out the -- that will keep us with flexibility and financing going forward. I would suggest you that the activities we have going on now are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow in out of them in, in out of the sales to pump up cash flow in any way shape or form, it\u2019s really more of just a prudent management process throughout the year, we'll have flexibility to push forward or pull back to depending upon continued interest rates, continued attractiveness from the banks, and so forth, but so far the process has gone extremely well. We have been very pleased with not only the demand but also the financial terms. Randall Stephenson : We'll continue to be confident this Next take rate [indiscernible] as John said in our retail channel we are now hitting 90% it\u2019s a learning curve. People learning how to sell this and the mechanics and the process for doing a handset financing program. We then moved it into our agent channel which is a very extensive agent channel. In the beginning it was not very impressive and the agent channel is now beginning to perform at levels that look like our retail channel. And so then you move into the big box retailers, it will follow a similar curve. And we come to the holiday season and John mentioned it then they are pushing volumes and this takes a little bit more time to sell a handset that's financed rather just one in a box. And so it\u2019s just going to be a learning curve, and we are going to stay patient but we actually feel very good that the numbers continue to move in the positive direction. Operator : Thanks we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Randall, you talked a little bit about DIRECTV. Could you just give us a little bit more insight into the deal process? The 180-day clock expires in March. I think you referred to a first-half close, so how that's going? And any updates on the synergies? I think you talked about higher numbers. Is that content synergies? Is that more bundling synergies? Is that something that's going to come in early on, versus later? And I think you also talked about video to any device. I know Verizon has talked about an over-the-top rollout in mid-year. So is this something that you are going to have a similar type offering this year? And is that contingent on the DIRECTV close? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : First of all deal process, you nailed when the 180 day clock is running again, but obviously there is a legal challenge going on between the content providers and the FCC and that\u2019s kind of the big unknown in our process right now. We are hopeful that the two parties the FCC and content folks can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there is court proceeding let\u2019s do here soon that will help to determine the pace in which that progresses. But even with that Simon, we are still fairly confident this thing gets done first half of the year. And so I can\u2019t get any more refined that because of this issue. And so this issue would be the only issue that will cause a delay of the 180 day clock to our knowledge right now. As it relates to the synergies, it's a fairly predictable formula with us and we do these large scale deals and when we are doing the deals we tend to be fairly conservative. And we have obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management team some forward discussions and getting to a level of detail that\u2019s appropriate within the confines of the DOJ review and so forth. And so we are starting to see details on the channels and then channel costs and so forth. And as a result as you start drilling down through it, it's fairly much across the board we are seeing better opportunities and what we baked into the original deal economics. And so that\u2019s why we are feeling pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at the time that we did the deal. And across the board there are looking good. There are even revenue synergies, when you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high-end customers and see what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base it looks really good. The opportunity to be able to sell mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the Board cost synergies, a few revenue synergies, it\u2019s all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal.  And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing. When we did this deal our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the [content] [ph] relationships that DIRECTV has and our wireless customer base, we envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in our store. You are familiar with the order deal that we have done with the Chernin Group, where we are developing over the top content with them and taking advantage of ways of delivering that to our customers as well, so it's going to be a multi-faceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers, but we\u2019re looking at multiple channels and channel line-ups that we\u2019d be able to accommodate into our wireless customers both tablet as well as handsets as well as our broadband customer base 16 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned, there\u2019ll be more to come, but this is a high priority for us is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and tablets. Operator : We go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joe Mastrogiovanni : A couple follow-on questions, if I could. John, if there was an attractive opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizable like America Movil is expected to be, given your funding requirements over the next few years, do you think a transaction like that -- you could do a transaction like that and stay within a comfortable leverage range? Or should we expect some equity component for a sizable transaction? And then, Randall, part of the strategy of allowing the base to move to new pricing, with the help on the churn side, and while we saw the benefits of that over the prior two quarters, we did see churn return to a level similar to two years ago, as you pointed out. Are you comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you think this fourth quarter was more of a one-time-ish in nature, or should we expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move throughout 2015? Randall Stephenson : I\u2019ll answer John\u2019s question on Latin America. The America Movil thing is just too uncertain even answer your question on and I will say it again, we\u2019ve got all we can handle right now in Mexico. And we\u2019re going to be focused on getting Nextel International closed, integrating that network, integrating those customer channels, integrating the distribution channels and getting ourselves scaled in Mexico, so anything else is just kind of speculation and then probably isn\u2019t worth conversation at this point.  In terms of churn, I would tell you I\u2019m comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to churn. And I\u2019ll say it again, when we compare it to two years ago which was the last major iPhone launch and only three national carriers carrying the iPhone to have a comparable level of churn, with the kind of pricing moves we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace versus two years ago, I think that\u2019s pretty good performance. And this performance for the quarter, we\u2019re comfortable with. We are as I mentioned before, really focused on that area of our customer base that tends to have the lower churn and that is our business customer base and the high-end consumer customer base where we\u2019re experiencing the churn. As John said in the feature phone side of the house and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now who can call where pricing goes in this industry? I haven't the slightest idea. It moves, it\u2019s very volatile, but right now we\u2019d like the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel, we have probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B. And we think it\u2019s very important and we think also that that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way through the cloud with our net bond strategy and that\u2019s proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see us focused and like I said I can\u2019t predict where pricing will go. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden : Maybe first one, just Randall, obviously your views have been expressed on this Title II as a way to get to the net neutrality issue. But I guess from the investment community standpoint, are you of the view that there is going to be really anything different about the business, in terms of the business you do, or how you do it? Or are the investments you are making kind of on a middle- to long-term basis? If you could kind of talk us through the investment side of that equation. And then, John, just a question on the write-down of the copper plant. Could you talk a little bit about what that was, where it was, and what kind of expectations we have for that going forward? Thanks. John Donovan : Sure Dave let me give Randall a break and I\u2019ll take the copper question first. We went through a study and in our business there is active payers that are copper payers that are connected to customers and serving customers. There\u2019s spare payers in that network that are available that are in great working condition and available to be used if needed. And then there are what we would consider dead payers or payers that need significant repair work that are not connected to any customers, they need significant repair work and investment to make functional.  We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers in conjunction with that, identified marked and made the decision to abandon those ineffective payers or what we would -- what the [indiscernible] dead payers. We have plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active payers and spare payers, so we don\u2019t expect any limitations on that. That\u2019s how we went through the process it was a very extensive process that was a very unusual process to go through. We don\u2019t expect any further write-offs like this we're not aware of any and we just felt it was appropriate to recognize this fact anybody has found our business has seen the change in our access line customer base over the last five or six years could understand that we would have peers that would be inactive and in this case ones that were not economical to activate not to mention the fact there is not demand for us to make that [indiscernible]. So that's the background on just across our traditional wireline footprint. Randall Stephenson : A favorite topic title 2. David Barden : Sorry Randall. Randall Stephenson : Look I will address it from a couple of perspectives. First net neutrality, what this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral internet. And I would tell you I am not -- I don't know if anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality and indeed the President laid out four principals for what that meant. And we look at those four principals and said we're okay with those.  Those four principals is what resulted from all of this was the FCC were given authority to enforce those four principals, it has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions none whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way you effect those four principals is by categorizing the internet and wireless services as title 2 communication services that's a different deal, alright and that's something we have to say what does that mean and whether the implications of categorizing these services as title 2 services to our industry. And the example I give is we're right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services moving to IP or to all wireless and there is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced services. And we're working through that with the FCC, it's a very collaborative process it works but it takes a lot of time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services or begin replacing them with the new services by 2020 that's an aggressive time line.  The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause and when we say we are pausing investment till we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring to.  Now Chairman Wheeler can find some creative solution, categorizing these as title 2 but doesn't cause the industry to slowdown, doesn't cause investment cycles to slowdown, does not cause innovation cycles to slowdown. It will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at the same pace we have. But till we have kind of have clarity we're saying we're just on any new investments we're in a bit of a pause mode but it's really up in the air right now.  There are a lot of ways of getting what the President has articulated he wanted to accomplish. One of them is the Congress is working on it and that is that the Congress would pass legislation that would give the SEC the authority to enforce the four principals that the President articulated were important. That works to us, that puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying to do. But these really strident heavy handed regulations on wireless and broadband if we go down that path that's what causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and so forth. So it's up in the air, right now we're just anxious to see when the SEC comes out, so we now begin to formulate our plans. Operator : And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : I was wondering if we could chat briefly about your commentary that post the completion of some of your pending acquisitions, and some other initiatives that seem to be on the table, your debt coverage ratio may go over that sort of 1.8 times level. Could you perhaps give us a sense on where that could go? And, perhaps, what is your priority maintaining your near-term credit rating? It sounds like discussions with credit rating agencies have been constructive. But I was hoping to get some clarification, if possible. John Stephens : I will take that if you look at the Direct TV transaction based on some of the most recent published financials you will know that there is a cash fees in that transaction that would approximate about 15 billion and I think if you go back to the last financial statement their gross debt level could be at $18 billion to $20 billion level that would be the debt we would be adding on as well as any impacts from closing Nextel and [indiscernible] as compared to our first quarter.  And then we've got some other -- as we mentioned we can't talk about the special options and so we won't do that, but will have other impacts from matters ongoing that will impact our debt range.  With regard to that it is very conceivable that our net debt to EBITDA ratio would go above two, I think that's assumed and possibly in somewhere in between the 2 to 2.5 range, I know that\u2019s a great wide range but that\u2019s where we feel comfort right now stating in. Those are the kinds of levels of debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the transactions. What we would then focus on doing is because we will have accretive free cash flow after the DTV transaction as we said before we would take the excess cash flows after dividend and use that to commit that to paying down debt as quickly as possible.  We suggested over the course of the three year cycle that ought to get us back to what is more traditional levels, for us that\u2019s a 1.8 times net-debt-to-EBITDA. And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our recent transactions but quite frankly our entire portfolio today, we have after tax cost of debt well below 3%, so its producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at 1.8, where just a few years ago our expense rates were higher.  You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1.5 or 1.6 net-debt-to-EBITDA. So that\u2019s where we are at. We will let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit, but we are comfortable with where we are going and we understand the implications.  The last thing I would tell you here is as we announced last week we set up a facility with a collection of banks in 18 month, three year, five year terms for over $11 billion, the net after tax cost of that debt averages less than 1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities, such that reasonable people at the banks are in this process are still very interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates within ability for us to prepay without penalty and ability just to live the if you will facility open until such time as we needed.  So we feel really good about where we stand in the crowded market. We will continue to work on it but we will continue to feel good about where we are at. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much, John. And just one additional follow-up, if I may. In addition to your significant acquisition activity, you folks have also been successful at monetizing some non-core assets over the last 12 to 24 months. I was wondering if we should consider this element of your strategy, and how it may fit into your priorities for 2015. John Stephens : Yes Amir, it\u2019s a great question. I am not going to comment on the specific items. I think we started talking about monetization assets back three years-ago. I think that was the first major transaction we had done was a Yellow Pages transaction. So if you think back from that timeframe to today, you understand that -- I mean you clearly understand the multibillion, tens of billions of dollars we generate, I will say this we have a $300 billion of assets on our balance sheet and we have a history of being Fortune 100 type publically traded companies, we are done yet. We have an opportunity to do more. We will continue to evaluate and as management we have an obligation to maximize returns on our assets. So getting to high utilization and high results that\u2019s part of our responsibility, we will continue to focus on it. Though the balance sheet as large as ours it would be inappropriate to collecting the things are complete. There is always opportunities. Operator : And that is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : So, earlier, Randall was talking about lessons learned as you move up the curve with Next. One of your competitors, T-Mobile, has learned that they can change the way they provide credit to their customers. They are placing a higher priority now on payment history than some of the traditional credit metrics. Have you learned the same thing? And is there any change in the way you are extending credit to your customers as they adopt Next? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : I don\u2019t think there are lessons learned, I think all of us over the years in this industry know that you know your customers better than anybody else does. And customers that have been with you for a period of time regardless of what their credit scores are you tend to treat differently. And we have for many years done that whether it be on the fixed line side or broadband, U-Verse customers who pay us well that may have lower credit scores, we have actually gone ahead and extended them services like U-verse which requires significant upfront investments and so forth. You are doing on the business side of the house too, you know your customers well. And so you are willing to invest in your customers that you know who may have credit scores that are weaker than what a new customer you will be willing to do with the new customer coming with a low credit score.  So there are not any new games in this business, we have all been playing this credit scoring game for a long time. It\u2019s a fairly predictable process, we know our customers well, we know when we tweak credit policy, what to expect and within what timeframe to expect that reactions. And it\u2019s actually gotten fairly mechanical and arithmetic to be quite honest with you. So I don\u2019t think there is any new science out here on this. Brett Feldman : And are you finding that the banks that you are working with are recognizing those lessons that you have learned in the way they finance your receivables? John Stephens : Absolutely. We have gotten very high, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have high demand in a securitization process and we are able to get the pricing levels that we are able to get. So they recognized that and quite frankly all of you know, most of you go to our financial statements and our provision for bad debts and understand with a company that has over $130 billion worth of revenues, you can clearly see just how effective we are at managing -- particularly in a difficult economy how effective we are in managing our receivables. The team has done a very good job across the board business consumer through processes just like Randall described. Randall Stephenson : You bet. Thank you Brett. Thank everybody for joining us and taking the time to listen in on the call. As we articulated at the beginning, we feel very good about where we\u2019re going in 2015. As we get to the end of 2015, we\u2019re going to be talking about a very different business and a very different company and we\u2019re excited about it and look forward to working with you over the course of this year. So thanks again for joining us. John Stephens : Thank you all very much. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our teleconference. We thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

So with that as an overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in AT&T. We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last three years. We set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every part of our business, to lay a new foundation for the future and for growth. The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put it simply, we are executing very well. We have completed or are near completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead of plans with many of the transformational customer and operational initiatives that we now have underway. The results are impressive. You know the story. Our 4G LTE network now covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed new spectrum, densified the network, and added DAS [Distributed Antenna Systems] and Wi-Fi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best-in-class network. Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer locations, and we now are offering 75-megabit speeds in 90 cities. We've also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations, with our 1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and network-on-demand possibilities. While transforming these networks, we've also invested heavily to transition our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones and usage-based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use smartphones, and almost 90% are on usage-based plans. And just one year ago, we accelerated the shift to the no-device subsidy model for smartphones when we launched Mobile Share value plans. Customer response to these plans has been tremendous. About 60% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers already are on no-device subsidy plans. The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected tough comparisons when looking at year-over-year financial results, but our record-breaking churn demonstrates that we made the right move in introducing these plans. We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In prepaid, we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium prepaid experience. We also saw the future of the Internet of Things and developed platforms such as the connected car and home automation. We now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the future is very bright for additional growth. In wireline, the transformation to IP broadband is nearing completion. That means most of the costs associated with this transformation are also behind us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP, and about 90% of the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 30% of our business wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services. And finally, we have been laser focused on improving our operations, driving efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project Agile cost savings initiatives, including Digital First, which is our company-wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of millions the last two years, and we expect to see that increase by millions more in this coming year. We also have been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities, and the customer experience, while reducing expenses as well. And we took a giant step with our leading software-defined network initiative when we launched Network on Demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities. We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing costs, and implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our strong balance sheet and gives us the financial strength we need to continue to invest and diversify our business. The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in the first quarter. Those details are on slide four. We've executed Project VIP in our transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we laid out for you last quarter, vision of a new AT&T, a diversified, integrated wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers, uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed mobile connectivity and video. We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. We have done a lot of work identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between these two great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, installation, customer care, and even sending just one bill. This has increased our confidence that we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year three. In wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless acquisitions, and we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the mobile Internet. We plan to deploy a near-nationwide 4G LTE network, something we know how to do very well. It will be covering about 100 million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross-border opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a business standpoint. We have also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 MHz of spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it was unused spectrum. We've already put much of that unused spectrum to work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well. We also made a major investment earlier this year when we acquired licenses for near-nationwide contiguous 10x10 MHz block of high-quality AWS-3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost efficient manner. We know what we have and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to delivering a network that customers want, that customers expect, and that customers will use. With that as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial summary on slide five. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than $32.6 billion. That's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline properties. This growth was driven by continued success in wireless as we reposition our business model, strong demand for strategic business services, and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%, but revenues were essentially flat year over year if you adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap integration expenses as well as costs associated with the voluntary employee retirement plan. It also excludes a one-time $0.05 benefit from a tax planning related matter. And while we don't show this on an adjusted basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from our previous equity ownership of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil as well as net income from our domestic Connecticut wireline operations. Those two provided about $0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of last year that we don't have this year. Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows, with free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes an additional $500 million investment in our Next customer base. And capital expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $4.4 billion. And in terms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 billion. At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS spectrum and Iusacell. And we are also well positioned for our planned investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19 times. And as we've said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, Mexico, and spectrum, we will go above our normal net debt to EBITDA target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our target range. Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on slide six. Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the international segment in our financial statements and is separately broken out. The repositioning of our smartphone base by giving customers the choice of lower-priced service with no device subsidy plans continues to show positive results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever had and the best in the industry this quarter. This continues the positive trend we saw last year and comes in a very noisy and competitive marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong continued signs of improvement thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations. Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 million. That was led by gains in postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid subscribers in what is traditionally a slow net add quarter, thanks to strength in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a decline of feature phone subscribers. We also grew our high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. And when you look at total branded smartphones, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the quarter. We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued strong showing by connected cars. Connected device net adds were impacted by a change in how we report our session-based tablets. Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're reported as connected devices subscribers. This gives us and you a better view of phone growth in prepaid, which now essentially includes only phone activity. You see that this quarter. Thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new businesses. The team has done a very good job of transforming this business. Retention is ahead of schedule. Churn is less than expected and certainly much less than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More than 90% of Cricket customers already are on the GSM platform. However, we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters as we complete the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks. Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid pace. We had about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% of all phone sales, and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base. We still have about 16% of our phone base to transition to smartphones, but the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those customers to no-subsidy and usage-based pricing has been a big investment for us. But once again, we made these investments, executed our plan, and are now in a strong position to move forward. Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue are on slide seven. AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly two-thirds of smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by 36% growth in equipment revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't increase equipment expense for us, so the no-device subsidy model works for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with bring your own device. As expected, service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share value plans. But because we have now passed the anniversary of the introduction of these plans, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will improve in the coming quarters. At the end of the first quarter, more than 70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of the postpaid smartphone base on no-device subsidy pricing. This means our first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of smartphone subs on no-device subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are on plans 10-gigabytes or larger and about 20% are on plans of 15-gigs or more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. This helped drive a 14% increase in data billings. As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the third consecutive quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the quarter, with the average monthly Next billings about $6 and growing. That strong sequential increase comes even when you factor in the impact of our new Data Rollover plan, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our sales are on Next, so our ARPU with Next is expected to continue to grow. Now let's move to our wireline operations on slide eight. Our focus on profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline results. On the business side, Strategic Business Services are now close to a third of the business wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong demand for those services. Adjusted Strategic Business Services revenues grew by more than 15% in the quarter. And when you adjust for FX, growth was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.3%. However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our discontinued low-margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. If you consider those items, the decline would have been 1.7%. And if you look at our combined business wireline and wireless operations, revenue actually increased year over year. While overall wireline business operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part due to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network grooming. Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for Connecticut and FX. Small business revenues were also down. However, there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales from our fiber build. We also took a significant step recently in our transition to software-defined networks. We introduced Network on Demand for business customers in more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order, add, or change network services on their own in real time. In consumer, U-verse services now make up about 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 2%. U-verse started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing penetration, and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 400,000 IP broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base. We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP-eligible customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the year as well as the costs associated with those conversions. At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded our 75-megabit services to nearly 90 cities, and we offer GigaPower in 10 markets, including a just announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a milestone with our Voice-over-IP services in the quarter. We now have more than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjusted U-verse consumer revenues of almost 20%. Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on slide nine. Wireless service margins were essentially stable year over year. There was pressure from customers on no-device subsidy pricing in advance of upgrades and from the full quarter of inclusion of Cricket operations. And our new Data Rollover plan also had about a 20 basis point impact on margins. This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost saving initiatives in the quarter. Wireline margins continue to stabilize, and operating margins were flat year over year. There was pressure from non-cash benefit expenses and TV content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and Strategic Business Service revenues and solid execution on our cost initiatives. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5% compared to 19.6% in the year-ago quarter and 18.9% two years ago, but most of the year-over-year difference is due to our strategic investments in Mexico and Cricket. Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We discussed the success of our Digital First initiative earlier. We also have made headway in cutting cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% reduction in cycle times on some IP products, with more than a 50% reduction in the fiber-ready buildings. Our software-defined network initiatives will help even more. Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the quarter on slide 10. The first quarter was another big step in the transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to Mobile Share value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped drive industry-leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net adds. The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer revenues, and our migration to IP broadband is near complete. In business, Strategic Business Services, which include our IP services, is close to a third of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at more than 15%. At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business through video and international operations are on track. We are confident the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly. Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to invest and to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with our standalone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow. That gives us even greater confidence that we can hit our growth targets for the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico acquisitions. We are on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have made the investments and done the hard work necessary to position us to be a very different company, and we are ready for the opportunity ahead of us. With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions. Operator : Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks very much. John, thanks for the update on DIRECTV. Can you just go into the merger synergy guidance a little bit more? Just what are the main buckets there? And help us think about how it phases year one, year two, year three. And then you sound confident on the closing this quarter. Given all of the headlines we have out there, just can you just give us some more sense of what makes you so confident? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you, Simon. Real quickly, Simon, the base of most of our savings that we previously announced was going to content contracts as we understood them to be standard in the industry. And that was the basis for a large part of our $1.6 billion original target; that along with some of the normal synergies associated with bringing two public companies together. The additional ones are the opportunities we now see in going to, for example, one single truck roll to install products, so combining the installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities into one truck roll; or getting the customers on one single bill, one single customer care operation; the ability to go to our supply chain to get better pricing with regard to our equipment because specifically one of us was buying set-top boxes and other equipment at lower numbers than the other one was. And so when you combine those, we're confident we can get some more supply chain savings. There's also the standard cost of things like combined advertising, combined customer care, combined activities. But that's what we built up to this $2.5 billion. They are cost savings. But we believe that they are very much real, very achievable, and we believe that they'll grow. Certainly in that third year is when they get to that $2.5 billion level, but they are significant during the 2017 third-year timeframe. They will build starting in 2015 but build really in 2016 and really move toward significant amounts in 2017. With regard to our confidence in the transaction closing, it really comes down to what the transaction is about, and that is bringing customers greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing expanded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that they want, and really to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for customers through our additional investments of some of these savings. So as we continue to go through the process, we continue to feel good about where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it this quarter. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, John. Thanks. A quick follow up on Simon's question. Have you had any indication from the DOJ or FCC either way in terms of approval? And then second, if you can talk about the Mexican business, the same thing. What barriers remain to closing Nextel? And how do you think about integrating those businesses from here and the need to ramp up CapEx to do that? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah. So as would be normal in a transaction like the merger of DTV and AT&T, our legal representatives are having the normal process and contacts with parties within the rules in the normal course. I won't go into those details. But I will tell you, Phil, if you look at what's on the record out there and the benefits this brings, I think there's an easy path to see why this deal would get approved and the benefits it will bring to consumers. So I'll leave it at that. We continue to feel good about it. With regard to Mexico, the process for Nextel first had to go through the U.S. bankruptcy process and the opportunity for other bidders to come in. That process has all been completed. The U.S. bankruptcy court has approved the sale. So we're now just left with getting the regulatory authorities in Mexico, IFETEL, to approve it. We're in, as you might expect, normal contact, and that would be normal in a deal, respectful contact and working through issues with them. Our experience with them on Iusacell, our experience with them on the regulatory framework that they've set up, and the economic environment they set up gives us confidence that that deal could close shortly. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And in terms of integrating those two mobile businesses once you have them? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah. So we will operate as one business. We will get significant benefits from the two networks. And so we will be able to utilize the infrastructure of both companies to really help us manage and really prioritize capital investments, so it really will allow us on a combined basis to ramp up the networks much more quickly. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you combine the two companies, they clearly have a leading spectrum position in Mexico, which also gives us an opportunity to very efficiently ramp up. Your comment or question, Phil, with regard to will we need to spend capital on that asset, absolutely. We intend to get the network quality up to our standards. And as quickly as prudently possible, we're working through those plans. And once we get the Nextel Mexico merger completed, we'll have all the information at our disposal to finalize those plans, and then we'll come back to the Street at the same time we do with the DIRECTV merger and update you on those plans. But it will take some additional capital. But quite frankly, in the company the size that we will become once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deal are closed, it will be a very manageable level of additional capital. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Hey, Mike. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Just a couple things. I guess first on the wireless side, I think your comment the way we would read it is that phone-only ARPU and service revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective, have we bottomed out and hit the tipping point there? And then secondly on wireless, what's the experience that you're having with customers that are on the Mobile Share value when they go to upgrade? Are you seeing any unusual churn activities around those guys? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Mike, quite frankly, we're not seeing any unusual churn activities, really. I don't mean to be inappropriate, but the 1.02% postpaid churn is the best we've ever had. And if you go beyond, if you subdivide our postpaid base into postpaid smartphones, as you can imagine, the trend is even lower. So we feel very good about that. With your comments with regard to service revenues, when you look at our service revenues this quarter, clearly it was impacted by, so to speak, a full year of opportunity for customers to transition to Mobile Share, and really not only about a month, no time prior to the first quarter of 2014 and only about a month of 2014 first quarter for customers to transition. So this is going to be the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time. We expect those comparisons to get easier or to be less challenging as we go through the year because we've established much more of a stable Mobile Share value base as of the end of the first quarter compared to where we were at the end of the first quarter last year. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : John, if I can just sneak one in, just thinking about cash flow, any thoughts on plans for factoring in 2015, a magnitude question? And CapEx run rate a little lower than we anticipated, is that just ahead of the deals closing? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : CapEx is just what we needed. It is lower than the run rate. We're not changing any guidance on CapEx. It's just more of a philosophy to spend it as you need it, don't spend it early. With regard to factoring, you can expect us to factor every quarter this year. Part of that process is to get an established track record on that. We did do it in the quarter. Even with the factoring we did in the first quarter, we added to \u2013 as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we added to our total investment in our Next customer base by about $500 million. But I think we expect to continue to use that securitization process in an effort to eventually get to a point where we'll have another option for financing our business, whether we choose to use it or not. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Hey, John, just a couple questions. First actually, can you give us a number of how much factoring was done in the quarter? And then a couple follow-ups to previous questions, the 70% of adds coming on no subsidized plans is a big number. Is that the top that we can expect, or can you push that still higher? And then lastly, switching gears over to wireline, margins were off, EBITDA margins were off a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a sense for maybe what's driving that and how that should trend on a year-over-year basis? Should we continue to see declines, or with some of the costs coming out of the Connecticut properties, do you expect that to be bottoming around here? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : So, John, let me try to make sure I hit all these, and challenge me. If I skip one, let me know. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on about 6.2 million net adds and upgrade sales, so around 4 million Next sales. You guys can do the math on an average price of a phone to get the gross receivable. We mentioned that we increased our receivables, net increase in our investment in our customers by about $500 million. The offset to the rest of the purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring, and then some collections from customers from previously sold Next phones in early 2014 or even a few that we sold and 2013 that are now paying us monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the company. So we're not subject to prior monetizations or securitizations. On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 60% \u2013 65% Next take rate before and we've seen it again this quarter. The one thing I will tell you is that to get it to 70%, we had about 5% or about 300,000, a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they don't bring any equipment expense. And so that's a good deal for us. They often join Mobile Share value plans, so they are sticky customers. That is the unknown, if you will. That 300,000 is a little bit below what it was running on a quarterly basis the last three quarters of last year. But this is typically a slower \u2013 first quarter is typically a slower quarter. We're still encouraged by the level that \u2013 that will be the determinant of where we come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get higher than that. We'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good about the fact that in total that no-device subsidy is at 70%. And quite frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share value for smartphones is at 62%, so we're running hotter than that. And then third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to pick up from that $6 level. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Right. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus, particularly in wireline, on cost savings. I think you're aware that we did an early \u2013 voluntary early retirement program. I think our take rates on that were in the 3,300 range, so we'll see some savings from that going forward. Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from company-owned to leased arrangements. So they moved out of depreciation in some of those characteristics into COE. And we'll manage through that and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those margins. And as I said, we're still confident with our guidance, and that guidance included improving margins in wireline, wireless, and overall. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Just to follow up a bit on churn, if I listen to some of things you were saying, you've got a growing share of your base on Mobile Share value plans. And there's obviously a lot more value in those plans, so they're more attractive. You have a growing percentage of your base on smartphones, which you said have a lower churn profile. And you keep selling tablets, meaning your average customer probably has multiple devices, and usually that means lower churn. So is it reasonable to think you could actually continue to improve churn from here? I know the second quarter of last year is a tough comp, so putting that aside. Or are there mitigating factors, including the competitive environment, that might just create a little bit of a floor on where you can go right now? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : I'll say this. We're very pleased with where we came in on churn in the first quarter, particularly with the noisy and competitive environment that we operate in. But we are not getting into the fact that we can't do better from here on out. We're not predicting that. We're not guiding to that, but we're certainly striving to do that. You are right, Brett, that the second quarter of last year is going to be really tough comparison. But with that being said, we still are striving to do better each and every quarter than we did the last quarter, and we'll keep that effort up. When you think about Mobile Share value accounts, there are just under about 20 million of those accounts, and they average just under three devices per account. I think we can get you the detailed numbers, but it's probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there are about 2.9 devices per account. And yes, that really does help with churn. Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher. And as we've reduced that base down to 16% now of our postpaid base and we're seeing flow share of only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base. And that will give us another lever to really make an attempt to manage churn to a lower level. With all that being said, it is a competitive environment, and we have to be ready to handle whatever situation issues, offers come out from other parties in this environment, regardless of the logic that may or may not be behind them. Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, and just as a quick follow-up, since you mentioned the feature phone base, as you come towards the tail end of migrating them to smartphones, how do you think about that residual base? Is there a proactive effort to get all of them into smartphones, or is there just an acknowledgment that some of those customers will probably eventually just come to end-of-life and you're going to let them go? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : We don't want to necessarily lose any customers, Brett, we want to keep, and we've got a lot of really good ones that are still on feature phones. But the issue is the functionality of our networks is so dramatically different when you're using a smartphone, and the value our customers can get out of our networks is so significant, is so much greater with a smartphone. So we're certainly encouraging that. What I will tell you that's encouraging to us, though, is that we're finding that we're having real success in the prepaid space, in the traditional no-subsidy or low-subsidy model prepaid space and still getting really good ARPUs and still using a lot of maybe lower cost but a lot of smartphones there. We had a significant number of smartphones added to our prepaid base. So I would tell you that a feature phone that may not want to go to the full postpaid smartphone relationship might stay with us in a prepaid relationship and still get the benefits of some very good network and quality and phones, and yet do it in a different pricing in different subsidy mechanism. Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you for taking the question. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Can you give us a little more color on what you said about seeing some increased signs of some improvement in SMB and passed homes with fiber, some additional businesses with the fiber build? How many additional businesses have you built? And what are some of the signs that you're seeing a little bit of a turn in that part of the business? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : So, Frank, we've built \u2013 800,000 customer locations have been passed with fiber. What we did is we built a significant amount of those to customer order, where customers, existing customers, new customers order that and want us to build. But we also built a measurable amount to, if you will, into areas where we were confident we could sell and be effective. In those areas that we've built and spread the copper before we had a contract in place, we are now aggressively selling into those areas, and we have been pleased about the ability to penetrate those buildings and to sell into those. So that's the encouragement. In many of those buildings, you've seen how it works. You can go into a building. It might have 20 potential customers in there, and you have to sell to the first one. And once you get the first one sold, you can come back and then have some credibility with selling to the second, the third one. So we are making some significant progress in getting those first sales inside the building. And the team is working hard under Ralph de la Vega's leadership to then go back and really maximize all the opportunities in those buildings. People love the fiber and the high-speed that it provides, the quality of that service. So this investment ahead of an order is starting to show signs of paying off. That's what's encouraging. Additionally, we're continuing to see interest from our normal business, small business customers, and some of our packaged deals with regard to a combination of our bundled mobility and wired IP services. I don't want to suggest that we are seeing the small business market take off, but we are, and our numbers will explain the reason for me saying that. But we are seeing continued strong demand for IP and strategic based services, those Ethernet-based services, those IP-based services. Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And what should we expect going forward on a quarterly or annual basis for these types of businesses that pass? How many more do you have? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : We're going to get to 1 million business customer locations passed. If you think about the run rate we've been on, it's pretty easy to think that we can get to that 1 million by the end of the year. That would be a very reasonable process. We've publicly stated that we can get there by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. So that is what I think you can expect. With regard to predicting growth rates or trends in the small business area, we haven't done that. But I will tell you on the overall Strategic Business Services, I am encouraged that we're at the 32% level of revenues. I'm very encouraged that it's reached $2.6 billion. I'm very encouraged that even in this tough environment it grew 15% on an adjusted basis. And when you take into account FX pressures, it would have grown 17%. I think the team is doing very well, and the network we built is attracting customers for its quality, its security, and its speed. Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, John and Mike. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Hi, Amir. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to follow up on the questions around the competitive landscape. How do you think about the level of promotional activity for the course of this year versus last year? And specifically, how should we think about your strategy going forward? Last year, obviously, you made a concerted effort to adjust pricing in order to migrate more of your subscribers onto Next. Do you foresee needing to have to do that again? It doesn't seem like, based on the comments that you made on ARPU trajectory, but I just wanted to confirm. And then I'd also be interested to hear your thoughts on the Google announcement today and whether you view it as a possible new competitor over the mid to longer term, even though it seems fairly limited in scope based on what they announced today. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Okay. I think with your first question, Amir, I think you'll continue to see us taking actions on the strategy that we have laid out already; that we are going to continue to focus on profitable customers and providing smartphone growth, Mobile Share value, getting customers on Next or BYOD, and continuing to migrate. Now we've got 90% migrated to usage-based plans, and use the LTE deployment of phones and the, so to speak, year-over-year growth, data growth we've seen of those phones of about 50% to then drive data growth and then drive higher buckets. So that's the strategy there. Sure, I'm certain we will have some promotional activity, as we always do, but I wouldn't suggest to you that it would be out of the ordinary, out of the normal process. I will also suggest here that we are just in the beginning phases of the connected car, of the Internet of Things, and of the opportunities that that's going to provide us. This really deep, high-quality, 308 million people that are covered with LTE or have LTE available to them is really a great thing for all the Internet of Things product and services, whether they be the connected cars or the other platforms we have out there. And we believe that over terms, we'll see really great growth there. I think we added close to 700,000 connected cars in the quarter. So it still has a long way to go, but it's growing very quickly. And remember, what we're seeing today is really just mostly the wholesale arrangement, and here as we mature through this process, we'll get that opportunity to get the retail arrangement. With regard to Google, I would suggest to you I'm not an expert on the matter, so I don't mean to be, but I understand your commentary about it's very limited. So I understand it's limited. It's got a very limited number of devices. That's not generally the way we like to present options to customers. We like to provide a lot. My understanding it's limited in this case. My understanding also is that there's going to be very limited distribution and customer care. And those things are items that we found our customers value. So we'll just have to wait and see, but it's just another one of the plays in the environment that's out there. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks very much for the color. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Take care. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, maybe two if I could. Just the first one, Verizon is getting a lot of attention on the OTT strategy, both skinny bundles and the wireless side. But depending on how things shake out, AT&T could be the nation's largest video player. Could you give us a sense as to the timing and what we should be expecting coming from AT&T on this front? Are you working on this pro forma knowing that DTV deal is behind you, or do you have to wait for the DTV deal? I think people would love to know where you guys stand on that. And then just second, I think, John, you've thrown out a deleveraging target at some of the conferences of about 1.8 times within a three-year timeframe post the deal. Could you divide \u2013 waterfall how you get there from a combination of operations and asset sales? And then rumor has it you're running the real estate group at AT&T now. Could you map out where the buckets for asset sales inside of AT&T are and scope it for us? It would be helpful. Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : So let me get to a couple things. One, I won't give any detailed plans about post-DTV AT&T. I don't think it would be prudent at this time. But what I will tell you is that over-the-top distribution of video on wireless, on broadband connections with or without linear subscription is something that I'm sure we'll see and something that we will see be a part of packages in the future. My own experience is that I see it as an add-on to a subscription package. And I think we believe that that will be the way a lot of the opportunities will go, but we're certainly open to it, and we're going to certainly be in a position to help and develop that part of the process. I won't go into the Verizon situation or any specific offers on our part. With regard to deleveraging, I will go this way. We're expecting free cash flow to exceed dividends and provide cash not only this year but into the future to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to expand, not only just from the acquisition of DTV but from the content savings \u2013 excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even today. And that will expand EBITDA even more, which will by simple math help the metrics of net debt to EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all aspects of our asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have a about a $300 billion total asset portfolio today that will only get larger with DTV and Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities. I would suggest to you that if you look at our record over the last three years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth of cash from asset monetizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently, so we've netted a significant amount of that cash to be able to use. And we'll just continue to do the same process that we've done. I wouldn't expect anyone to think that we are complete in that process, but I'm not going to get into listing any specific items. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, two if I could. Just one, could you disclose what the postpaid revenues were in the quarter? I think it's something that you've given out in the past. I didn't see it in this quarter's release. And then secondly, if we just take a step back on the wireline business, you talked about the investment you made, a lot of broadband for homes with the VIP project. How should we be thinking about the impact that should have on broadband units over time, being able to grow that residential broadband business? Does it take a certain amount of time before you get some benefit from the sales, or is there something else that we should be looking out for in terms of impact there? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Mike, I'll let Mike and the team follow up with you on the details of the postpaid revenue details, and refer to what we put on the website. Whatever we give you, we'll make sure it's out there on the AT&T website. I don't have those numbers right in front of me. With regard to the wireline business, the VIP project, and specifically I think, Mike, you're probably referring to the 57 million IP broadband locations, I'd suggest to you this. What we really need to see is the DIRECTV deal to close because the transaction, the key to being successful in that area is that customers want a bundle. And so with the closing of that transaction, we'll be able to have a bundle not only of the video services that DTV provides, but of the broadband services that we can provide. As I mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband locations, a little bit under that number, don't currently have a video product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide the efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one pricing structure, we believe that that will not only be good for our company, but it will be very good for customers that they'll have a new competitive offer out in the marketplace. And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV-AT&T merger is a key factor in that process and a key factor in bringing great quality services to customers. And from our surveys and from the information I've seen, it's what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you that we'll probably have more to say on that and give some insights to that when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within about a month after the closing of DTV. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, AT&T, Inc.: Okay, Tony, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you very much, and that question will come \u2013 Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, I have two, if I may. The first one, I was wondering if you can give us an update on your fixed wireless strategy. I know that was part of VIP a while ago, but I was wondering if it's changed at all with what you received in the AWS-3 auction. And then the second question is, it's my understanding that for the AWS-3 debt that you raised to pay for those proceeds that you're capitalizing that interest. I was wondering if you could just talk about how much debt is actually being associated with the AWS-3 auction. Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : So first of all, your second question on AWS, yes, we are capitalizing that, and the amount of the debt that is being associated with that is a ratable share of our overall debt portfolio. The overall interest cost has come down significantly over the last three years as we've refinanced debt. But it is an allocated share based on the $18 billion, approximately $18 billion purchase price. So that is what is getting capitalized. With regard to the fixed wireless local loop, Colby, I wouldn't suggest to you that anything's changed at this time. We still have the commitments out there in the DTV transaction, and we still stand ready to live up to those and to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and the marketplace as a part of that transaction. But we're still confident that we can satisfy that, and we'll see how that comes out. That's probably \u2013 the finalization of the DTV deal is probably going to have to come before we're going to go through and I'd be ready to discuss any modifications, if any, to the fixed wireless local loop plans. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. Our work the last few years sets us up for a transformative 2015. We are ready to move quickly once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals close. Our networks are in place, our customer transformation is on track, and we are seeing tangible results in our Digital First and software-defined network initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter adds to that confidence. Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. Wireline's focus on profitability and strong demand for IP services brought margin stability and growing IP revenues. We are ready for our Next transformative steps and we are excited about the opportunity we have before us. One last thing before we go, as a good friend of ours, Kathy, would tell you, on your way home tonight, don't text and drive. It can wait. Thanks again for being on the call.

Welcome to the AT&T Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for AT&T, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Viola : Okay. Thank you, Lori and good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us today. As Lori said, I am Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter and then we will follow that with a Q&A session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website and that\u2019s att.com/investor.relations. I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our Safe Harbor statement. Before we begin, the Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. And as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T\u2019s website. Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69, that\u2019s up more than 11% over last year\u2019s second quarter. This includes adjustments for a non-cash charge related to Leap\u2019s network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV and Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It\u2019s up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless as we repositioned our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth. Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year\u2019s second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis and that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis. And so with that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens and he will discuss our operational highlights. John? John Stephens : Thank you, Mike and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today and as always thanks for your interest in AT&T. As you can see in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expand the margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position. Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you are adding the customers who brought their own device, nearly three quarters of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best ever service margins. In wireline, our transition to IT services continues at a strong cliff. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near 4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now a third of our wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace. So, all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We are executing at a high level and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our operational highlights starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition the smartphone base to the no subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off. First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity on last year\u2019s second quarter, which pressured service revenues. So, our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison. Second, as service revenues stabilized and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only revenues increased sequentially reaching its highest level in three quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade. Our focus on costs, Cricket\u2019s operational efficiencies and other cost savings programs, such as Project Agile, help drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s second quarter. The story of the last six quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been ahead of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. Let\u2019s talk more about that on Slide 6. We have made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a year, nearly two-thirds of our smartphone base has moved to the no subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. While customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones. We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs \u2013 and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels. And the Mobile Share Value plans, continues to draw new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans. We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7. Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking in the gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers after losing about that many in the year ago quarter. Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround. 97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shutdown the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers, almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform and about two thirds of the gross adds are choosing our highest value plans. Those are plans that have higher ARPU. In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carrier\u2019s postpaid ARPU. And we are doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket even as we decommission the networks. We also had our second largest connected device net add quarter ever. Our leadership in connected cars drove that growth. Our relationship with eight car manufacturers producing more than half of the new connected cars in the United States is driving this as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies. The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. The smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year\u2019s best ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year as we added more than 740,000 branded devices. Now let\u2019s look at our wireline operation. That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher margin legacy services. That\u2019s not a simple task. But the team\u2019s extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or we can expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint. We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to exit low margin wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped to reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network on demand capabilities with our next generation network investments. These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service. Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just a cost efficiency program. We are not only finding ways to take costs out of our business, but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%. At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales even if it meant a reduction in revenue. Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate and we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That\u2019s quite a tribute to the business teams\u2019 efforts in this space. On the consumer side, U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and are targeting of high value subscribers. We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition. Now, let\u2019s look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That\u2019s more than 200 basis point improvement. Adjusted operating income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year. And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well. Now, let\u2019s move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion, that\u2019s nearly four times our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in seven quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We still expect standalone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount. Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our standalone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect standalone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV in the $12 billion range or better and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near-term. The strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business. Now, let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions. Our transformation plan is working. When you build the great network, develop next generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that\u2019s all growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, but just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we are on track to hit our standalone guidance metrics. Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great and our expense management helped drive our best ever service margins. Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service. And we expect to reach 350 million people by year end. Owning these network assets not only provides a high level of service quality for our customers, but also gives us owner\u2019s economics advantages. We are also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions, it\u2019s circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at anytime. We won\u2019t be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what\u2019s best for our shareholders has not changed. Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed. We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas very soon after the deal closes to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company, that we believe will not only transform us, but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it. With that, Lori, let\u2019s go ahead and take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. John Stephens : Good afternoon, John. John Hodulik : Hey, the two things I think that stood up the most in the report were the service revenue trends and the wireless margins. So, first, on the service revenue, given the trends you are seeing and the slowing shift to the Mobile Share Value, do you feel confident that we can get to growth in that line item in the second half of the year given the competitive environment? And then on the margins, big improvement there, 600 basis points in the year-over-year basis. I mean, there were some add-backs, but is this \u2013 is that the kind of improvement we should see throughout the rest of the year? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes, John, good question. Thanks. First, let me say this, we are pleased with the team\u2019s efforts on the cost containment and that really help push the margins up. They did a great job and they continue with that focus. On the service revenues, we did get a little bit of benefit this year or this quarter from the promotional activity that took place last year. So, the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in the service revenues. While we are not giving specific guidance on either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we are going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we are going to continue to expect to grow margins both on the wireless and on the consolidated side. So, I will stick with that, but yes, we are very encouraged by it. The discipline that the team has shown is impressive and we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline. John Hodulik : Alright, thanks, John. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : We will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess if you could talk about Mexico, can you expand for us on the plan there. You have talked about $3 billion investment. How does that split out across CapEx, OpEx? What\u2019s the timing? And when can we see those networks really integrated and ready to start ramping growth? Thanks, John. John Stephens : Yes, so thanks, Phil. The $3 billion capital investment is capital dollars. It\u2019s expected over about a 4-year period. It won\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t suggest you and it will include updating 100 million POPs to LTE. But as I have said before that won\u2019t be linear, each additional POP won\u2019t have the same capital investment associated with it, because we will focus our efforts on those in best position to be upgraded and those best positioned to serve customers. That\u2019s how we will get the 40 million we are targeting by the end of this year. So the, if you will, capital will not be spread evenly or ratably over the cycle time. With that being said, I think you can view us as getting to that 40 million next year and at the end of, I think it\u2019s \u201818 we have talked about, we will get to the full 100 million. That\u2019s the spread plan that we have, Phil. But the $3 billion is capital dollars. With regard to this year, what we really want to make sure is clear is as we spelled out in the separate international segment, the international business right now is requiring some investment. We are aware of that. We expected it. And we are going to make those investments. And with that investment and the investment in capital this year, we still believe two things will happen. We will be able to come through in the CapEx in the $18 billion range for the total company, including the Mexico CapEx and we will generate free cash flow in the $12 billion range or better, including both the capital and operational expense requirements of the Mexico business. Phil Cusick : If I can just follow-up, the $18 billion in CapEx this year implies a nice downtick in the U.S. spending, what\u2019s driving that? Are you finding that you just don\u2019t need to spend it or are you sort of pushing that out to next year? John Stephens : Well, I think a couple of things. And the simplest thing is to say network team did a great job in getting the work done and we\u2019ve got 300, nearly 310 million POPs with LTE right now. And we are putting on a spectrum to use as opposed to building towers. And so that aspect of it is just a utilization of spectrum we own and capabilities we have that don\u2019t require as much CapEx. Secondly, the 57 million IP broadband and what is now approximately 900,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. Once again, the network guys have done a great job in getting the Project VIP initiatives completed. And when they are done, there is the additional spend isn\u2019t necessary, because the project has been concluded not for lack of anything, but for success. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving our changes. We continue to focus on working capital and construction work in progress and driving down cycle times and a whole host of other efforts, the team is doing really good work on and that\u2019s also helping out, but it\u2019s really positive things that are driving this capability. We are going to continue invest in capacity. We are going to continue to invest in successful sales. We feel very good about our ability to continue to respond to customers in a positive way. Phil Cusick : Thanks, John. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : And we go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Hey, guys. Thanks. I had just a quick comment on competitive positioning, thinking about the handset losses in the quarter. Clearly, it\u2019s seeding a little bit of share here at the benefit of probably margins and probably some of the ARPU trends, but just maybe a comment on those sub-losses you are seeing in the handset side, the quality of those subs. And then, secondly John, your thoughts on cash taxes as we look into 2016? John Stephens : Couple of things. Mike thanks for the question. First only, let me say it this way, on a branded net add basis we were negative, on voice we were positive. We added voice customers. Now on the postpaid category, we did lose some feature phones, which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid side with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that two-thirds of our Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50, $60 month plans. Two thirds or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we are losing and quite frankly, higher than a lot of \u2013 some people in the markets postpaid ARPU. So we are getting great tradeoff. The beauty of that, though and the thing is helping margins. So, there is very low acquisition subsidy costs with regard to those customers. We did sell over 7 million smartphones through the \u2013 in the quarter. A lot of those were in our prepaid space, but we did sell that. Beauty of it is that the customers are satisfying the financial requirements of those phones such that it\u2019s allowing us to keep our margins up. Mike McCormack : And John, we are seeing a meaningful amount of those sort of postpaid feature phones moving over to the Cricket brand or prepaid brands? John Stephens : No, those will be migrations. So we would account for those as migrations, so you wouldn\u2019t have those in our net add numbers. The 330,000 voice net adds in prepaid were all customers we acquired that had not had service with anybody before or we took from other providers. So we feel really good about our competitive position and we are really excited about our prepaid brands and very excited about what\u2019s happening with Cricket and quality of the customers we are getting. And quite frankly, the great job the teams done in the accelerating the integration, getting us over on the \u2013 on our GSM or LTE networks, getting smartphones to these customers hands and really providing quality service. Churn is \u2013 the reduction in churn is really impressive. And you can see from our slides, overall churn \u2013 total churn was down 16 basis points, that\u2019s mainly driven by the improvements in our prepaid. Mike McCormack : Okay. And the cash taxes in \u201816 as we look at it? John Stephens : Yes, I think the key issue in cash taxes in \u201816 would generally be expected to go up because of the tax rules and currently in place right now. No legislation for bonus depreciation. With that being said, there has been a bill that came out of the Senate finance committee I think just last week. There has been a lot of activity in the house to extend the various tax extenders, research bill and credit and other things and include bonus depreciation. Some say for a 2 years cycle, others say 3 years to 5 years cycle depending upon which piece of legislation we are talking about. If those happen, we would see a significant benefit from a company who invest in the United States and invest in jobs through CapEx in the United States. So that\u2019s yet to be seen as what will happen. Mike McCormack : Okay, great John. Thanks. John Stephens : Thank you, Mike. Operator : We will go to David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first John if I could ask the wireless margin question another way, which is looking at the sequential change in the cost, there is about almost $750 million of sequential costs went away after you subtracted out the merger and integration expenses. So could you kind of parse down what happened quarter-over-quarter in the wireless business and can we expect this starting point to be where we should look at wireless margins for the rest of the year and in \u201916. And then, I guess, as a second question, it\u2019s no secret we are all trying to figure out the implications of the potential conditions here. But I think as the level is set in that conversation, could you kind of go through what you are able to talk about in terms of the scope of the current GigaPower initiative, the economics around that initiative, cost of home passed and so we can kind of all be on the same page in that conversation? Thanks. John Stephens : So let me start with the wireless, right. There are a couple of things we need to be focused on. One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we have been able to free up a lot of spectrum over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way. So be able to serve customers more effectively get more LTE. Secondly, we have \u2013 the Cricket as you know the company we bought was operating at a \u2013 and it will say that challenge environment will challenge results from a margin and operating income perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They are now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back if you look at the prior public company we bought the lead company and you can get a sense if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter, that\u2019s one. Two, we have seen efforts in our customer tier and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we have done a whole variety of settings, whether it\u2019s the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there, with the \u2013 whether it\u2019s the retail stores having the sales agent spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it\u2019s moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first call resolution or it\u2019s our extensive investments over the last few years in Digital First and allowing customers to, for example order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those types of things on their smartphones. All that has driven, call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of, we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone. So that\u2019s another activity that\u2019s going. Our LTE network is a lower cost network and we are continuing to see people use more data and buying up into bigger plans, that\u2019s helping. Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones longer under the next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we are optimistic that we will be able to continue much of that momentum maybe at different levels, but we are going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we are very optimistic about that. With regard to the transaction, I won\u2019t make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we have announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber to the prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We are seeing great, if you will net promoter scores from our customers who take those services. And we are encouraged by that. And I think based on prudence how these \u2013 the comments with regard to it is that, but we are encouraged by what we have seen out of GigaPower and the capabilities it brings, not only to our customers, but to us as a service provider. David Barden : Great. Thanks, John. John Stephens : Thanks. Operator : And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much. John, I was wondering if you could switch gears back to start assessing the competitive environment, particularly in the wireless arena, there has been a lot of discussions around levels of promotional activity in sort of the first part of the year, whether or not we are at elevated levels or sort of depressed levels versus last year. As you look out towards the remainder of the year, you had mentioned that you are taking a disciplined approach, I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color in terms of your strategy going forward here in terms of either from a promotional standpoint or if there is some new products coming on the line with this merger, the type of strategies that you are taking for customer acquisition? John Stephens : Yes. So let me just say it this way. We are certainly evaluating and watching our competitor\u2019s moves in the marketplace. What I would tell you is that we are not responding to each and everyone from a discounting program. We have shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with \u2013 with an effort to make customer care easier, customer service easier, customer data situations, like rollover data, where we can meet some of the customers\u2019 pain points and satisfy them. And we have done a great job in providing value customer solution with our prepaid brand. Those are the kinds of things we are going to do and continue to do. I think you have seen it in our numbers that this disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we did have positive voice net adds. So we feel good about what is done to positioning. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we have had in that wireless base was probably acquisition of Cricket and giving us that capability that platform and the distribution to really serve those value customers in a different way. But if you will, yes, it\u2019s a competitive market, it continues to be noisy, a competitive market, but it\u2019s been that way for sometime and I wouldn\u2019t expect necessarily to change. But I do like our ability to compete with the tools that we have that are different than our competitors. Having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share value, having Next, having connected cars and connected devices, having all those tools in this great network, I believe we are in the best position to compete going forward and are looking forward to that opportunity. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you. And then if I may one brief follow-up in thinking about sort of churn levels and then we have seen sort of a tick down from the prior quarter and in thinking about the scope of the competitive landscape, how do you think that sort of churn should progress through the course of the year? John Stephens : Yes, we won\u2019t give any predictions, I mean, specifically on that. We are focused on churn as a way of giving good service, lowers churn, lowers churn, gives good profitability. So, we certainly value it. And we will continue to focus on it. I will just leave it to say that through 6 months, our churn on a postpaid basis is lower than last year\u2019s full year. And last year\u2019s full year was our best year ever. And then secondly, as I mentioned, if you peel through our numbers, you can see our total churn dropped 16 basis points, which means our prepaid churn, which I did mention had its best quarter ever for us. And our prepaid churns are improving. So, we are really focused on it. And we believe that gives us that opportunity to really generate value, still being very competitive in the marketplace. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much for the additional color. John Stephens : Thanks, Amir. Operator : We have Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. John, during your statements, you mentioned that you are increasingly focused on driving profitability in the wireline side and you know that there was a small loss of video customers against that strategy. It implies you saw something in the market that you just didn\u2019t want to respond to. So, if you could maybe give us a little color in terms of what you saw, what you didn\u2019t like, and where you are really focused strategically? That will be helpful. And just along those lines since the broadband numbers, we are just a little under run-rate on U-verse I think you talked about where you were from a penetration standpoint in an upgrade cycle, if you could revisit that? That would be helpful. John Stephens : So, a couple of things. One with regard to we do have a tremendous focus on driving cost out of our wireline business. And as all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins to go with them. So, as we are growing our strategic services, U-verse services, we are really focused on controlling costs, so we can replace \u2013 to maintain our profitability. With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter is always seasonally a challenge. You got a lot of relocations. You got a lot of students returning from college. And with our currently limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it\u2019s always a challenge for us. The issue then is do you go out and do a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth? We chose to be very disciplined and very limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7% or almost 4%. So, it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That\u2019s how we think about it. When we are capable of bundling all our services together, we are very optimistic about our ability to compete. With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do it this time, not only with the seasonality, but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or a high-speed broadband. That process has left \u2013 has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband. And we are only about 1 million left. So, coming from a number of years ago, where we had 14 million to convert, we are down to 1. And so you will see \u2013 it\u2019s just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So, I will leave it at that. Brett Feldman : Alright, thank you. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : We go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. John, it sounds like the FCC is getting ready to put out the final rules for the broadcast incentive option. You have put out a commitment around $9 billion under certain conditions. Can you just review your perspective on the 600 auction? And then any color you can give us on securitization during the quarter? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes. So, with regard to securitization, Simon, we did do some this quarter. They were about $1 billion this quarter and we did about $800 million in the year ago quarter, so a slight increase in the securitizations, I am assuming you are talking about the net securitizations, continue to see strong demand, continue to see a real interest in that investment by a number of banks at very attractive rates. And we are getting to the point now that we have lapped the full year and are building a history with regard to this program, which is very good for the company. This has to give us flexibility going forward. So, very pleased with it, expect we will continue to do it, but the differential year-over-year was not dramatic as it may have been in some prior quarters. That\u2019s one. Two as far as overall spectrum goes, we are always interested in looking at spectrum and the opportunities to improve our spectrum position and we planned for that on a regular basis. With regard to participation in the broadcast auction, we did offer to participate when we first announced our intention to acquire DTV. We will wait and see what the final terms and conditions with regard to any approval of that merger are, but in any event, I would suggest you that will be interested and prudent in investigating the opportunity see what\u2019s available and participate in an appropriate way as we move forward. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. John Stephens : Thanks, Simon. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joe Mastrogiovanni : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, so you are on track to bring the CapEx down to the $18 billion range, but this does follow some heavy investment the past few years. As you look out over the technology roadmap, like 5G coming down the pipeline, do you anticipate that we will see another period of elevated investment? John Stephens : Good question, Joe. I would tell you that\u2019s kind of a longer term perspective. What we are seeing is our move to get this fiber deep into the network and getting LTE out deep into the wireless network and the solutions that we are finding in a software-defined network opportunity, we see a real opportunity to actually strive to bring investments, if you will, lower or more efficient from historical levels. Right now, I will tell you that this year\u2019s investment is going to be in that $18 billion range, which is about 15%. We are certainly \u2013 we are not going to give any guidance with regard to next year or the year after. And we will give an update on this year\u2019s guidance, if and when in our analyst conference if we get that opportunity. With that being said, I think there is a real opportunity with some of the activities are going on in software-defined networks on a longer term basis to actually bring that in capital intensity to a more modest level. Joe Mastrogiovanni : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We go next to Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. Can you give us an update on how many homes you\u2019ve passed with GigaPower and sort of what the cost is running on that right now? And then secondly, on the wholesale business, what exactly is the trend there? Are you losing share or is it just lower pricing or is lower volumes or where is that actually going? John Stephens : So, on the wholesale business, first thing is we exited our mobile housing business. We have really turned that down, not pursuing it anymore. That\u2019s having a significant impact on the global \u2013 on the wholesale business. That\u2019s the first point. The second point we are saying is the continued \u2013 not only pressure on the legacy analog services, but a movement towards more efficient IP strategic services. So, when the customers move up, sometimes they have both services in place, but even after they shut off the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there is a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the \u2013 our win percentages and our ability to hold on to that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale though is the fact that we have decided to get out of some business and on the second piece is some of this growing as they have transitioned to strategic services to Ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive. We will continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space. With regard to GigaPower, it\u2019s just we are not giving out cost per unit pricing this time. And let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it to multi dwelling units or whether you do it to a single home and a single residence. So, all of those factors at this stage could mislead folks with regard to any kind of factual numbers. So we have chosen not to do that. But we are just getting started with the fiber to the prem activity. We are pleased with it. I can suggest you that we are probably still in the early stages of it. But the take rates, the satisfaction rates continue to outperform our expectations with our customers. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you. John Stephens : And Lori we will take one more question. Operator : Very good, that is from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Ratcliffe : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two on the wireless side, if I could. First of all, can you give a little color about what\u2019s driving the improvement you are seeing in prepaid churn, just improving credit quality or better retention, something else going on there. And second, given the continued growth in Connected Cars, any insight you can provide around the economics around those what ARPUs running and if there are any subsidies or revenue shares involved? Thanks. John Stephens : So on the prepaid business, there is a couple of things. One, great plan, great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they are right now a great network. So they are getting great service with cost efficient plans. And we are able to do it because they are paying for their own phones. So it\u2019s really just a lot of hard work by our network team and getting these customers converted from the network that they were on the CDMA network they are on onto our LTE networks. So they are having a great experience, that\u2019s one. Two, we are giving a good pricing. We can do that because they are paying for their own phones essentially. So and then our sales team and our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone and our cost structure. All of those things are what\u2019s driving, but the churn is really I am sure has a lot to do with these great networks that they are writing on. So I would suggest to that. On the Connected Car, there is kind of three relationships I think of when I think of that connected car and our revenue side. There is one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer/dealers and that\u2019s the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for whether it would be design, marketing activities, analysis, upgrades to mapping and so on and so forth. That\u2019s a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information needs out of that process, we will continue \u2013 we are hopeful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of that activity can be done off-peak hours. And so the auto manufacturers can gather that time and gather that data at times when it\u2019s very cost efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks when they are somewhat under utilized and they can still a really good quality data. Two, there is that\u2019s ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan and part of our Mobile Share Value plans has had add-on service. We are just getting started with that. We are very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars first are just rolling off. And secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities where that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it. And I think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running. And then lastly, there is a prepaid opportunity for somebody who doesn\u2019t own the car, but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in their car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today and we will continue to see that develop. We are optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak about the opportunities of the Connected Car. I would suggest the company that\u2019s our scale and size. We look to this to being not only a success in the today\u2019s net adds and today\u2019s relationships with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement. Lori, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : That will be from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks a lot. So John, a great job on the financial discipline, so you think the wireless expenses is a good run rate here. I know there is a lot of moving parts, do you think maybe you would a little light on the marketing this quarter or that was an impact then? Can you also just lastly give us some data usage statistics? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes, I am sure, Tim. Well, let me say this, on the margins, there is always going to be seasonality and we are always going to have the challenges there in our business. We are going to have a much smoother seasonality. We may have because of the way we have shifted the business, flip some of the pressure quarters and the hiring quarters around. We will have more smoother. But we will have additional activities as we get into the holiday season with more units and more activities with regards to that. Secondly, while we are going to continue to be disciplined with all costs including marketing, I would suggest we will continue to market and believe we have been effective with our marketing, but have not shut it down. With regards to \u2013 Tim what was your last question? Tim Horan : Yes, wireless daily usage and where maybe customers are in terms of utilization of their existing capacity of? John Stephens : Yes, we continue to see data growth per handset to be significant. And it\u2019s been running at kind of the 50% year-over-year increase for a while. With regard to the data plans, we are seeing customers a couple of things. We continue to see customers go to bigger data plan, some of the 20 gig and bigger plans. And anything that\u2019s helped our service revenues this quarter was we continue to see people do some overages even though we gave \u2013 we gave roll over to our customers to help them manage their plans. They took advantage of it. We continued to see some over usage. So we view that opportunity to get customers to buy some bigger buckets and move themselves out of that stress opportunity. But usage continues to be a positive for our revenue opportunities and continues to be something and our guys watch very closely. So we keep this high quality service. Tim Horan : Thank you. John Stephens : Thank you. Thanks Lori. For everyone on the call, I want to thank you for being with us today. In closing, let me say this. For the last 3 years, we have laid a plan that deployed next generation networks, that develops some innovative products and services and that has been focused on repositioning our customer base. And at the same time, we have been focused on cost management. Second quarter results show that this strategy is working. We now stand ready to continue this process with our strategic investments, in spectrum, in Leap, in Mexico, as well as our pending transaction with DIRECTV. We are ready to take advantage of our new opportunities as we transform our business and our industry. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be begin at that time. I'll now turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mike Viola. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, AT&T, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call is John Stevens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to provide an update with perspective on the quarter, and then we'll follow that with a Q&A session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website, and that's ATT.com/investor.relations. But first, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement before we begin. As you guys know, it says that there could be some comments today that might be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website. With that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, to discuss our financial and operational highlights. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in AT&T. Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth, and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success. First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, Business Solutions, Entertainment & Internet Services, Consumer Mobility, and International. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. Our network investments over the last three years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand. We invested in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 MHz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand, plus we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020 using cloud infrastructure and SDN. Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce costs and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project Agile savings are coming through. Automation and Digital First have reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help as well. So do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time, and working capital efficiencies. We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low-margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies not just with lower trailing operating expense, but also driving lower unit costs as we continue to invest in our world-class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less. And our expected cost synergies from DIRECTV give us even more runway to reduce costs. We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position. With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide four. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July. Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins, and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74. That's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly non-cash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs. The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion. That's up nearly 19% year over year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue, as we are reporting under GAAP accounting. If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion. Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our Business Solutions segment, including Strategic Business Services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our Entertainment & Internet Services segment. We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter. And free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last two quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters, and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow, and record Mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for, and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling. Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on slide five. Our Business Solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days, and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and Strategic Services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin. Breaking the segment down further, we saw revenue growth in three of our four customer categories, enterprise, small business, and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continued to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic Business Services revenue grew by more than 12% year over year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%. We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include Mobility Solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our Business Solutions team is competing and winning. Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We've deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see in our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure. Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real-time. Today it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times. And we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business Solutions focus is making the network on demand, the office mobile, and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business, and we are excited by the results. Now let me talk about our Entertainment & Internet Solutions (sic) [Services] (11:01) results on slide six. This is basically our former Consumer Wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year over year. But even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year over year. Essentially, we've converted a quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader earning solid margins through our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal. During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we are on a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers, and I encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising. We are also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for a premium single-service experience, so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters. As expected, U-verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter, as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high attachment rates. But we are confident we can work through this as our single-service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out. As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target, and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more. Now let's move to our Mobility results on slide seven. AT&T's Mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and the Customer Wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and stat profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations. Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service, and fair pricing. All this sometimes gets lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our Consumer Mobility business helped drive that with service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success, but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations. Total wireless revenues were flat year over year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues, and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues, which were essentially flat with second quarter levels. We also continued to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base is on no-subsidy pricing, with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone-only ARPU plus Next, which increased by nearly 5% year over year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket, and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly five years. Those details are on slide eight. Total net adds came in at 2.5 million, as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars, where we added about 1 million. But perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products. We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Our added voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter. Total churn was down year over year thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year over year, as we focus on higher-value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full-year churn of 1.04%. Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value-conscious customer, same great network, quality customer service, and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than our postpaid voice. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide nine. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on. Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring IUSACELL and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business, but we have done it before, and we are confident we can do it again successfully. We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan not only to deploy the highest quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity, and the potential synergies of a 400 million POP North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined. Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt the SIMADI rate in Venezuela, are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs, and margins are all pressured by FX, and subscriber results are being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work on operational efficiencies in Latin America. Now let's move to consolidated margins on slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago. There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes in our Mobility centers continue to drop, down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter. We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for access and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attrition, and normal reductions in operations. Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year over year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up, and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supplier relationships. We really like our momentum here, and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations. We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. Let's look at slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion. That's our best cash generation in 12 quarters. And we generated $26.7 billion in cash year to date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year to date. In terms of the uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.28 times, which was better than our original expectations. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early, and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt, and return substantial value to our shareholders. Now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full-year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full-year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, but just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage. We are seeing positive signs in our largest segment, Business Solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter, and the integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations. This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business and our industry. With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get to your questions. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Cathy, so we're ready for the Q&A. And if you can queue up the first question, we'd appreciate it. Operator : Certainly, that will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. I wanted to touch upon the commentary around cash flow, John, if I may. If we take a look at your raised outlook for the year, it does seem as though there's a little bit of a tempering in the cash generation in the fourth quarter. I would love to hear about what you're spending priorities are, and more specifically how to think about the longer-term cash generation capabilities of the joint entity. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Great, Amir, a couple things. One is there's always some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the holiday sales in our wireless business with the purchase of handsets and so forth. So there's always some seasonality, as you would find also with our wireline, particularly our large business segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year than we do earlier on, so those are the things that are impacting us. But I would tell you if you do a year-over-year comparison to where we're at and what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout the rest of this year. Secondly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said earlier. That is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend payout ratio that's in the 70%. We're not moving away from that. We're not shying away from that at all, and expect that to continue to be the case. We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our results as we go forward. But we're real excited about where we stand and the future cash generation of this business. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. And then if I may, a follow-up here in thinking object the joint entity moving forward, particularly when it comes to the potential opportunities with positioning the company and targeting your end markets. At your analyst update, you had highlighted that there are areas for potential cross-synergies, revenue synergies and opportunities. Specifically, I'm thinking about the 15 million DIRECTV households that don't have access to AT&T Wireless services. I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of how you plan on going after that opportunity and how we should think about leveraging the breadth of the full portfolio to target areas where you may have one subscriber on one service and not on the other. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Right, let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that we've really gone after and we've seen good success and, quite frankly, we're very excited about the results is in the cross-selling of DIRECTV as a satellite product in our company-owned stores. We have about 2,300 company-owned stores, and virtually all of them are actively selling DIRECTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so we had to do some training and some learning. But what we found as we came through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those stores. And we got very optimistic about it, and it gives us optimism for the fourth quarter. So that sales effort and that first line of synergy, if you will, from revenue opportunities from the retail distribution chain is working, and we're real optimistic about it. The second one with regard to cross-selling DIRECTV and the wireless customers, we needed to go through a process of making sure our privacy policies and a bunch of other administrative policies were lined up consistently, so customers had a seamless experience and an easy experience. We've done all that, and I think we've now got in place one of our call centers to service those customers on an integrated basis, and we're moving forward with starting to sell that. Based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really optimistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and next year. The last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for us or U-verse for us, but they haven't been installing DIRECTV. So we've been putting them through a training program, and we're expecting that to roll out, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully trained on installing satellite in the home, in probably November or so, the early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It will be a measured approach. We're going to have to \u2013 we don't have everybody trained on the first day. But we're excited about what that will bring and think that will bring some not only good performance in the fourth quarter, but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive performance and impact next year. So that's the way we're thinking about some of those things, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for taking the questions. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : No problem. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead, please. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. If we could focus a little bit on the guidance, first of all, John, is it possible for you to give us where we are on a year-to-date basis in terms of the $2.68 to $2.74? And then maybe what's driving the change in terms of is it just wireless margins that they were definitely ahead of where we were, or are you realizing synergies faster or if there are any other moving parts would be great? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. So we're at the $2.09 mark today, and that was ahead of our prior plans. As you know, the $0.74 was ahead \u2013 I'll say it was ahead of our most recent plans. That has really been driven by cost efficiency. And it's driven by savings across the board, whether it's a lower number of calls into the call centers, whether it's the really top-notch performance of our Digital First initiatives, whether it's the streamlining of our installation process through our, what we call Project Halo or High Automation Low Overhead process, whether it's the software-defined networks. All of those things, whether it's just blocking and tackling, taking calls into the call center and getting answers right the first time, all of those things, all of those things are driving cost savings. And we have seen some better performance, as I mentioned, in our Business Solutions. Our Business Solutions team is really doing well in a tough economy, particularly in the enterprise and the public sector space, but really, really well in the small business space. And that gives us optimism. As we mentioned with wireless, we're seeing growth in that area. But we are seeing the acceptance of our Network on Demand, our NetBond, our software-defined networks all moving customers in a positive direction. So it's all of those things giving us optimism for the fourth quarter. With that being said, certainly wireless and its performance goes without question that it is helping drive earnings performance. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just to dig a little bit into the churn commentary, your thoughts on whether or not we're seeing a spike up in involuntary. And then how does that pace out if we look at the feature phone subs? Are those the ones that I'm assuming most at risk there? And then secondly, just on the ARPU side, I know last quarter you benefited from year-over-year easy comps. I'm assuming that as we get into the fourth quarter, we should restart that trajectory and year-over-year declines getting better? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Let me take them separately, Mike. On the churn, first and foremost, yes, the feature phone churn is hitting us and having an impact on us, and those are decisions we made not to chase those customers. Can't make the math work on not only the pricing for those customers but the impact throughout our base. But secondly, we believe that we're picking that up and showing tremendous improvement in the prepaid space with Cricket. So we are seeing total churn come down, which I think is really important. With regard to ARPUs, we did have an easier comparison in second quarter of 2015 to second quarter of 2014 because of some promotional activities that took place in second quarter of 2014. But we've seen stabilization in our ARPUs and in our total service revenues, so we feel optimistic about the business going forward. But once again, we're going to be focused on profitable growth, not just chasing customer counts or specific targets. We're going to really be focused on just getting the most profits out of the business. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : John, just a quick follow-up on the churn commentary. Is there anything happening on the involuntary side that you're seeing there? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : No, Mike, I wouldn't turn you to that. We haven't seen a significant change in bad debts. I'd like to point or forced off (36:48). I wouldn't point to that. Our customer base is \u2013 quite frankly, we're very lucky to have the quality customer base we have. We're very fortunate. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, John John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks. So first on EPS, should we be thinking for 2016 of the mid-single digit or better off of the $2.71 midpoint, or should we be thinking about it a different way given the DTV deal? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Phil, let's look at it this way. We're not changing our guidance for 2016 going forward, so the mid-single-digit growth rate is still good. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The $2.71 is the... John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I'm not going to refer to \u2013 it's still good even with this adjusted guidance. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, so $2.71 is the right starting point. Thanks. And then on Project Agile, can you give us an update on what the overall cost-cutting level is here and how we should think about that pacing in the next few years? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I'd say this. We're going to expect it to continue growing over the next few years. What we had said originally was that we were shooting for $3 billion of cost savings. I would suggest to you that we're probably somewhere between a third and a half of the way there, and that we plan to at least get there, get to that total target or exceed it. And then I'd point to the $2.5 billion of targeted DTV merger synergies. And certainly based on what we know now, we expect to see us get there or exceed those. So those would be the two points. I would hope that we could exceed the Project Agile targets based on the progress we've made so far. These efforts do take time and investment, and we've been spending that time and investment over the last couple years to get here. We're seeing the results pay off. We're going to keep our focus in this direction, but we would hope to be able to exceed it. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. Good evening. John, can you talk a little bit about the video momentum? And you went through some of the channel changes here. On a net basis you did have subscriber losses, but I think you said before that you're hoping to grow your video subscribers over time. So perhaps you can just take us through the quarter and you showed some good gross adds on the DTV side. What's going on there with churn, and when do you expect to return to positive video adds? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Simon, good question. I think we had a slide on this with a chart that can tell you what was going on. Prior to the deal, there was some real pressure in the satellite video area. Performance was less than it had been last year. And then as you see it coming out after the merger and after we started rolling out sales in the stores, you could see that we really picked up the trend, and we expect that to continue. Secondly, with the rollout this quarter of the, if you will, one-truck roll or single-service experience where we can install TV and broadband at the same time, we not only expect the satellite TV to pick up, but we also expect the broadband, IP broadband, to pick up because people buy those things together. And so we're hopeful that we're going to see \u2013 we'll be able to show you some improvements and trend improvements continuing off of the third quarter in the fourth quarter. I won't make any predictions about specific levels, but we are optimistic with what we've seen so far. We think the trends are headed in the right direction. And we think the slide that we put together that shows that differentiation between 2014 and 2015 will give you good insight into that. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And the U-verse decline, is that run rate or is that all the gross adds shifting to DIRECTV, or is that a churn issue as well? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : U-verse is a couple things. One, certainly the lower-cost platform has been our first choice for net adds. Two, because of our focus on profitability, we really got away from promotional pricing, and those customers who were cost-sensitive just had a propensity to churn. When you first put those steps in place, we saw a little bit of higher churn in the second quarter. We're seeing a little bit higher in the third quarter because of that disciplined approach. But I would tell you that I think we still have a solid, very good, very high-quality customer base in U-verse, and we're certainly looking to continue to serve those customers with the best products and services. I think we're focused on lowering churn and keeping those customers quite satisfied. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, and our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just a quick point of clarification and then a question. You talk about the fulfillment accounting methodology change in the slide. Is that your previous methodology change from August, or was there something new? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Brett, that's the same change. And if I could, before you ask your question, let me give you guys some insights on it. On a year-over-year basis in this quarter, the fulfillment accounting had about a $0.02 impact. That is the differential between applying it to DIRECTV and U-verse this quarter as opposed to just applying it to the U-verse product last third quarter of 2014, and so that did give us some help. Additionally in this quarter, I want to point out. We had about $0.01 of help from the CAF [Connect America Fund] funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if you look at our income tax expense, except for setting aside anything that we treated otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other unique items that occurred, they balance off with the CAF funding and fulfillment accounting generating about $0.03 of benefits, and Mexico and the income tax was generating about $0.03 of pressure. So we treated those all as going \u2013 because they're going to be going forward, because they're going to be continuing, I want to make sure I pointed that out. With that being said, Brett, I interrupted you before you got to ask your question. I apologize. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, that was helpful. The question is we have a lot of new data points and disclosures that we had fun modeling tonight. But one of the things that we see here is we have video ARPU and we have IP broadband ARPU trends in your new Entertainment segment. And I guess as you think about your strategy going forward, your bundling strategy, do you have any guidance you can offer us to think about the right way to think of the trajectory of those two key items because they're so critical to the revenue outlook for that segment? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I think we're going to be looking to continuing to protect and improve on the trends that we've seen from growing those ARPUs. But likewise, with these assets that we have in place, I would suggest to you that our ability to capture the market, we're in a very good position to capture the market now that we have video where we had broadband before without any video, and now that we have broadband where DIRECTV had video but didn't have broadband before. So I want to suggest to you that we are going to look for profitable growth and focus on that, but we are excited. We are positive about the fact that in some of those cases, we have some growing ARPUs. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So just to be clear, it sounds like you're really excited about the opportunity to add more customer or more revenue generating units. That's going to be a big piece of how we think about shaping revenue growth through that segment. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : We are very much \u2013 we're very excited about the ability to add customers, absolutely. I don't want to suggest that we're not going to focus on profitable customers; certainly we are. But we're very excited about the opportunities. I'll go back to the cross-selling opportunities. I go back to \u2013 we've got high-quality video products, and we've got a high-quality wireless network and high-quality broadband capabilities, and they have capacity in all of them. And so that's a great way to expand your profits, by expanding the customers on those investments that you've already completed. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you for the color. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. Just first, John, a little bit following up on that question, just in terms of looking at the new way that AT&T is presenting itself to the marketplace, should we be looking at modeling the wireless business separately and the consumer business as giving us two very unique pictures of two very unique businesses, or is this really just AT&T Wireless the way it's always been run and we really should just be thinking about dividing it between the two pieces? That would be the first one. And the second one is on CapEx. There are so many now new parts of the business. Could you give us how CapEx is now being allocated between the Latin America, Mexico, and the domestic business units, and how we should think about all those different pieces trending? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So a couple things. One, David, for investor and analyst ease, we've provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless, and we've tried to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully we've been successful with that. But we tried to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest to you that as you look at it, the margins and the EBITDAs and profitabilities are \u2013 they are certainly different but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I'd just make that observation for you. With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys' modeling. I can tell you the way we focused on it is what the business relationships we're selling and what our consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we focused on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way. And I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices start showing more growth even than it already has, it will be beneficial for everyone to have this split. With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis, but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin America properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient; that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that and make sure that we don't miss out on a good customer. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective. On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the build-out is still a good number. We've started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced, and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you that $3 billion is still a good number. And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate, because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity, and in success-based capital for DIRECTV \u2013 for our satellite video product, much in the same way you would have seen us in the past taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for VIP is now behind us. We've gotten to \u2013 we're 950,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. We committed to 1 million. We'll get to the 1 million, but that's the only piece that isn't done. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Go ahead, please. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you all very much. I was hoping that we could spend a bit more time talking about churn. It seems as though there are some natural feature phone issues that are on the postpaid side anyway. Prepaid is faring quite well. Could you help us understand if we should be expecting more of that across the industry? Is this an AT&T-specific item that will stick us with for a few quarters, or how we should see that? And then secondly, I'm wondering on the DIRECTV synergies. What might be the first opportunity that you would have to update us on whether you are on or ahead of plan for that $2.5 billion? Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Sure. On the feature phone phenomenon, I would tell you that yes, our base of feature phones continues to get smaller. So over time, we'll lessen the impact this has on our churn. Secondly, Jeff, I would leave it to you guys to talk about it or to decide whether others in the industry are taking this approach. It appears to us from where we see customers moving around that some of the other carriers are not taking the same approach, and they're focused more on customer counts than they are necessarily on the profitability of the customers. But I think you would be the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that based on the offers I see that we are dealing with and the noise in the market. On the $2.5 billion, I think first and foremost, you'll see it in our results. But with regard to updating you, I think we'll continue to update you on the process like we've done today where we talked about how the retail stores are generating sales exceeding our expectations, how the single-truck roll is going to start rolling out November, those kinds of things. And I think you'll see us also update you like we did with the Viacom announcement where we basically said that we're going to get best-in-industry pricing for our platform. And so that would imply that we are getting to or meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. With regard to specifically reporting on the $2.5 billion number, I don't expect to be doing that the rest of this year or early next year because we are still in the midst of really getting it done, and we're more focused on getting it done than we are on reporting out on what it is. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much, and we'll try and sort it out. You aren't making it easy for me in my first quarter, but I'm doing my best. Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I'm sorry about that, Jeff. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: No, no. I'm delighted to be here. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : We're trying to make it as easy \u2013 we really did put the financial statements together in a way to try to make it as easy as possible to see. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you, I appreciate it. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So we'll do our best. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions, two if I could. First, going back to the 2016 guidance where you described improving free cash flow, I was curious if that relates back to the free cash flow guidance in August. Or does that now refer to the updated free cash flow guidance for 2015? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : That applied to the free cash flow guidance of $13 billion or better. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then secondly, can you just talk about in wireless how you're thinking about device installments versus the possibility of using leases as an alternative financing mechanism for customers, and how you see the environment evolving competitively for your mobile smartphone customers? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Mike, good question. First and foremost, with regard to installment plan versus a lease, we certainly have the financial capability and wherewithal to manage either one, to do either one, and we're open to it. But quite frankly, right now our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program. And simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of their term, they own the phone. And the phones have continued use and functionality for them, and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're seeing a side of that from this continued use of bring your own device activities in our company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and hooking them up to our network. But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision, and Ralph de la Vega and Glenn Lurie and the team follow it really closely. It's more about what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to want that program, we'll certainly consider \u2013 we certainly have the capability to do it. But right now we believe that the customers' satisfaction comes from that ability to own the phone at the end of that agreed-to term, and they feel real comfortable about that. And quite frankly, the difference in price I don't think is measurable from a lease to the \u2013 depending upon what situation you have. But when you get down to the real costs of it, it seems like it's worked out well for us by doing the installment plan. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Sure. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, AT&T, Inc.: Cathy, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking the question, two if I could. First on wireless and just following up, broadly do you see value in actually selling the phone to the customer? In other words, does it matter whether somebody gets their new iPhone from you or orders it from Apple and it sits on their books? And secondly on broadband, a couple quarters now where you're overall losing customers. Can you just give us a little insight on what the trends are in DSL and particularly where those losses are coming? Are those people in areas where you don't offer U-verse, or is it additional migration over to U-verse in areas where you do offer it? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Sure. On the value side of customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores a full scope customer experience and take care of all their needs. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of \u2013 if they buy the phones somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't quite frankly have the cost of financing the phone either on an installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now on the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a high number of phones through that program, and that's fine. We love to serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy the phones through Apple and Apple finances them, that's something we can definitely work with. So it's really more about what does the customer want, and how we make sure that we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers. With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make to you is over the last few years, the real trend has been a migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's been something that we've encouraged ourselves, and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage that have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process. And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas, or I should say we didn't have a video offering. These were generally out of the U-verse footprint, but now we do. And now we'll be able to provide them with a video offering through DIRECTV, and we're very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now this nationwide video service will help us in improving our overall broadband positioning. But particularly our U-verse broadband footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about it. That's how we look to it. I'm going to tell you. I think on the consumer side we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's not I think the exact number. It will be on the stat profile. But I would suggest to you it has changed dramatically over the course of four or five years, where it used to be 90%-plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration not completely, but almost completely. James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today, and I'll just give you a few closing comments before we go. The third quarter clearly delivered on our transformation strategy. We saw double-digit growth in our key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter. The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our $2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to unleash potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our increased confidence in the guidance update, where we raised our adjusted EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully-integrated nationwide products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward. Thanks again for being on the call. On your way home tonight, please don't text and drive. Remember, it can wait. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It's great to have all of you with us. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide some opening comments and then he'll close with 2016 guidance. John will cover our results and we'll follow all of that up with a Q&A session. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T Web-site. That's att.com/investor.relations. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. You've seen this before but it says that some of our comments today may be forward looking and as such they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's Web-site. So with that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall L. Stephenson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everybody. Before John just steps you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes to just reiterate the strategy we are pursuing that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world, and obviously that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and as from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer. And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year where we've put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfil this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition, and we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans, and we acquired two Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution, and this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world. Now, we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates and we did all of this putting together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet, and our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm. As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right, because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires more than anything else world-class, high-speed, secure connectivity, and it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or business, but all connectivity, wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, and it all has to be integrated. So for example, TV Everywhere, DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV, and the DIRECTV content agreements combined with our networks is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device. A couple of weeks ago, we launched a nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data, so our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016. We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses, and I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service which lets customers dial their bandwidth up or down literally on-demand. Internet phone service is also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to securely access information from a mobile device over a VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, or salesforce.com. The common thread to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless integrated experience, and again the core to making all of this happen is the network, and our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets, and we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets. We also continue to expand our fiber network to more businesses, so we're really feeling good about our networks, and we believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions because at the end of the day our customers are global, and that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational businesses. In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses that include nearly all the Fortune 1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now, and as you're going to see in a few minutes our growth in Mexico is exceeding all of our expectations. And also in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things and our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions, they are global solutions. We invested very early in this space and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in Connected Cars. We added a million of them in the fourth quarter and recently we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next five years. And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software defined networks, and I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint, and as a result we now have 40 MHz of fallow spectrum to deploy over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum footprint will have on our cost to build and operate our networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced the software and defined networks combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure, and our objective is really straight-forward, we want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end to end capabilities in enterprise, world-class distribution, and a globally respected brand, and while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015. If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid, our cash flows were way up, margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers, and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people, and we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds at wireless, satellite, video, and IP broadband. So to wrap it up, strategy is working. We have the critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy, and I'm going to hand it over to John now, and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John? John J. Stephens: Thanks, Randall, and hello everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let's start by taking a look at the quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow. At the same time, we continued to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business. In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This includes adjustments for merger and integration related costs and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue. Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold on to their smartphones for a longer period of time. During the quarter, the Company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The Company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in lower booked revenues by about $300 million, and it had a corresponding impact on income, margin, and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well. Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year. Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines. Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers, but higher-margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant currency basis with rolling strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines. We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced products is keeping pace with declines in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year and when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger coming in at more than 12%. We served the total connectivity needs of our customers and more and more that means mobility. Mobility and cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. We've established ourselves as the world leader in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. Our recently announced new Connected Car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category and our new Smart Cities and Connected Health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs. Let's now move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition, but our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were 214,000 with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly. We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase in satellite customers in our wireline footprint bundling broadband with their video service. Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive the increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter. It's still early but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. Our new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it two weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well, and we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year. These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers but the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is that TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice both inside and outside of home that is simple and easy for our customers to use. AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks and by the end of the first quarter we expect to have nearly all the top 25 cable networks. We've already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair price and that's [indiscernible] is also a win-win for the content providers in our integrated offerings. Now let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here. During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason. Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while three quarters of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient smart business in the competitive mature market. We also continued to grow our high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year once again, thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from the year ago quarter, and full-year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focus on higher value subscribers in a heavily competitive market. And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churns throughout the year even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or 170 point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable weak fourth quarter from two years ago. Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story and we are very pleased at how it's performing and we expect it to do even more in 2016. Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to the no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. Equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes. Total cash operating costs were down 1.8 million, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helped increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%. We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees from service revenues, as some of our competitors do, our full-year number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. Equipment revenues also were impacted by increasing number of bring-your-own-device subscribers. We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are our lowest cost subscribers and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability as well as our [indiscernible] selection of rate plans. Phone-only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than two thirds of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no subsidy plans with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 11. The wireless scene in Mexico is really getting [indiscernible] these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of the year and it brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. We also launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas, beginning in markets where we've deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong subscriber growth for the quarter with nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results for the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX, are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all of this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment. Now let's move to the consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidated income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year ago fourth quarter. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than a year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full-year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue. There were some reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our Entertainment Group and Business Solutions and our focused sales approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We've driven savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our Digital First initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software defined networking will radically reshape not only our cost but also the flexibility of our network deployment. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we'll continue to expand [indiscernible] margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico. Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We improved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion and we've generated more than $35 million in operating cash flow in 2015. Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico where we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course, but we've got financing terms from our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continued to tap the securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received about 900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong from operations. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders. Now, I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook. Randall L. Stephenson: Okay. Thank you, John. Last summer we provided a long-term guidance after we closed the DIRECTV deal and it really hasn't changed. We're tracking almost exactly on what we told you. And so when you look at 2016, what you can expect is double-digit consolidated revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range or better, stable consolidated margins with a solid business plan to improve in each segment even while we're investing in Mexico. Capital spending will be in the $22 billion range with our focus on cost efficiencies and SDN creating a downward bias to that forecast, and we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 70s with a goal of growing free cash flow this year. So that kind of wraps it up and with that John and Mike and I are glad to stay in for questions. So, Tony, we'll turn it back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael McCormack : John, maybe just a comment on the service revenue in overall wireless should be sort of lapping the big mobile share value push last year. Just trying to get a sense for the trajectory on the year-over-year decline. It looks like it continues to get better. I'm assuming we should expect that throughout the year. And then secondly on the Entertainment segment, I guess looking at sequential margins versus year-over-year, it looks flatter sequentially but there was the impact of the revenue recognition change. Just trying to get a sense for what we should be thinking about with margin trajectory there, maybe particularly as you go in there and get more wireless rights for content and maybe where those wireless right content costs flow through the model? John J. Stephens: Let me give you a couple of insights there. First into the service revenues in wireless, we have to wait and see what 2016 brings, but we're expecting it to improve throughout the year, the year-over-year trends. We continue to see a little optimism in what we're seeing from the customers and demand, so we expect to see improvement throughout the year in that service revenue. On the Entertainment margins, the first point I'd like to make is the $300 millionrevenue deferral did impact margins in this quarter. The margins would have been close to a couple of basis points higher if we would have had that recognition. That's the first point I want to make to you. Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in 2016, and specifically most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the Entertainment Group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interests, but clearly those items are leaving us with the expectation that we will have improving margins in the Entertainment Group. Michael McCormack : John, just as you sort of progress on getting more and more mobile rights for content, how should we think about where those incremental costs for the rights should flow through, is it entertainment or is it on the mobility side? John J. Stephens: We expect it to flow through in the Entertainment Group. Operator : That will come from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Two things. First to follow-up on Mike's question, can you just remind us, John, what the deferral is and will that impact revenue any further or is this sort of the most you'll need to defer? And then second, Randall, since 2009 you've been known as a bit of an economic savant. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing from your customers in the U.S., both consumer and enterprise, and do you see any signs of economic weakness? John J. Stephens: Phil, on the revenue deferral, this had to do with one of our major contracts and a customer signed up a two-year contract, and so previously DTV had recognized equally over each month of the contract. We recognize it as we bill it. So we just came to a consistency, brought it to the AT&T methodology. So that $300 million is not in anyway, shape, or form lost revenue, it's just deferred, doesn't change our customer contracts, it won't change our cash collection. It's just a deferral. And additionally, we didn't defer any expenses. We continue to recognize any out of pocket expenses with regard to that in the same way we have done before. Philip Cusick : And that's mostly only going to impact 4Q, right? John J. Stephens: There will be some further impacts throughout next year, but by the end of the next year, we'll get into the situation where the originating piece and the reversing piece of this will be offsetting, but that will take us through the next year. Philip Cusick : Got it. Randall L. Stephenson: Phil, this is Randall. 'You're economic savant', I've never been called that. So it won't surprise you what we are seeing. We are seeing some softness if you look at enterprise business on anybody that has anything that touches oil and gas industry. All those companies are a little bit defensive right now as you might guess. Also anybody, big exporters, people who are exporting, who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share and NetBond and Network on Demand, we're having a lot of success in the marketplace, and so we're taking share and holding our own but we are seeing some softness in those areas. The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, there's a decent holiday season in light of really aggressive competition, but the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated, in fact I do anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time, and you didn't see the step-up in consumer spending that you might've expected in the third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend. As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in the U.S. roughly, and there's a lot of science that goes into that but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years, you see it's been 2%, it's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and that went the economy's way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 2 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, if you look forward, are you going to see those in the future, probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2%, if you ask me to kind of handicap is there more downside or upside to that, probably downside, but it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now. Operator : Our next question in queue will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : The first question I wanted to ask was around your strategy in the mobile area. As you mentioned, Randall, during the prepared remarks, you have unveiled what I assume is the first of many plans integrating your mobile and video anywhere solutions. How should we think about your approach towards the competitive landscape going forward in terms of your go to market strategy? I mean it does seems though on a relative basis you probably weren't as promotional as some of your competitors, and would love to hear your thoughts as we progress through 2016. Randall L. Stephenson: So we closed DIRECTV on July 24 and immediately put in place some plans that will be kind of for the first phase of integration. We brought the TV capability into our retail stores and have had nice lifts, as you heard John talk about going through his remarks, and then January we did the unlimited data plan for our TV subscribers. What you should expect is you're just going to continue to see as we roll through 2016 capabilities and offers that take advantage of putting the two together, and the customer experience is going to continue to get better and you're going to see offers that we think are unique in the marketplace. I'm not going to get very detailed with you right now, Amir, because we are still in the process of getting some of the really critical content deals secured, but things are coming together very nicely and you're going to see this kind of a phased rollout over the next few days and in fact over the next 45 days you will get your first look what one of these will look like, and so stay tuned. But I think it will be an eventful year for the industry as we rollout new and different kind of capabilities, new and different type of programming options for the mobile device and even new ways to think about how you price in a mobile-centric environment. So actually I'm very energized and the further we get into it and work with our partners on the content side, the more energized I get about it. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much. And then maybe if I can switch gears to the video side, as you mentioned it seems though you continue to benefit from [indiscernible] integration has progressed, are you on the verge of rolling out more converged offerings with broadband and video and how should we think about that opportunity set for yourselves? Randall L. Stephenson: So, Amir, I'll tell you right now we are early in the process. The sales channel is just really starting to get their legs underneath them on how to attach satellite and mobility together. This is a new category and so we're very, very new in this and the performance continues to get better and better in the sales channel. Also keep in mind that we don't even have the installation workforce up to speed on provisioning this. So we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we needed to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well. As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter but U-verse churn offset that, so we were slightly negative in total. You'll see that relationship get better and we are doing some things to shore up the U-verse base because we are focused on the satellite product and so as a result you're seeing U-verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve. Not the least of which, we did some things on pricing to ensure that we can help begin to mitigate the U-verse churn. The other thing we did, and it's early but I think we are going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step into an unlimited data offer and this is we think a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers to have this type of offer put in front of them. So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get better, you'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel improves, the provisioning channel improves. And then some of these offers I talked about, some unique offers that will be mobile centric offers and some unique content available, we think those are going to continue to add momentum to this as well. So bottom line, we think the subscription numbers get better as we go through the course of the year. Operator : The next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : John, just a question on the cash flow outlook that you provided for this year, you obviously gave us some help thinking about the revenue, the EBITDA and the CapEx piece parts in that calculation. I think you mentioned some deferred CapEx related to Mexico. I'm curious if that's factored into the guidance. If you can give us any help on how to think about cash taxes with deferred bonus depreciation or extended bonus depreciation and anything else that we need to think about, like pension, that would be very value added. Thanks so much. John J. Stephens: Couple of things. One, with regard to the deferred payments in Mexico, those have been our plans all along. We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities and we're doing for a number of years. So those are all in already. There's nothing new here. Secondly, with regards to bonus depreciation, as we told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration assuming that we'll get passed but we would meet that \u2013 we would meet this guidance even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed. The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place, and so getting the bonus depreciation extended for five years and [indiscernible] is really important, but the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there. With regard to that pressure on cash flow, it did not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year and about $200 million but that's already been in the plans. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension plan is very well funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year on a year-over-year basis, but as you know from our prior year filings, our tax payments were really modest last year, and so we would expect those to go out. But all in, we feel pretty comfortable hitting our guidance and we are certainly working very, very hard to do better on that guidance. Brett Feldman : And just to make sure I heard it correctly, and maybe I didn't, but I think you said that this year's CapEx did include some of the deferred payments in Mexico, meaning that you will hit your free cash flow next year even though you have already recognized the CapEx early on your [indiscernible]? John J. Stephens: So [indiscernible] talk about CapEx is like it was this year that it was 20.7 and we'll have about that 15% of service revenues which is about, so it gets to be about $22 billion for this year. That will be our CapEx. The working capital impact of paying for some of last year's purchases this year is in our working capital calculations. I think of it separately from my CapEx numbers, but yes, it's already in that guidance, so we will be adjusting the guidance for that. Operator : The next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden : Maybe this one is for John or Randall, for the first time in a while we're looking at some reasonably comfortable headroom on the balance sheet, 2.3x leverage versus I think your kind of historical comfort level limit of 2.5 turns, and for a company of AT&T size that's a real money. Obviously we have the 600 MHz auction coming up. New York Post tells us you are buying Time Warner. It is obviously a lot of things that could be on the agenda here including just sticking to your deleveraging agenda. Could you kind of rank order some of the ways you want to use what headroom appears to be there relative to the deleveraging priorities? John J. Stephens: With our strong cash flows, we're going to continue invest in networks as we've said, keep this quality up and keep these product offerings moving out and we feel comfortable about doing that within that $22 billion range, but we do believe that positions us well. We do think that includes all our merger and integration activities. We've got a lot of fallow spectrum out there that we bought over the last few years. So we're in a very good position to be able to operate within those kinds of parameters and still provide the highest quality service. With regard to the cash after we've done that investment [indiscernible] and we're going to continue to be [indiscernible] loyal and respectful of our shareholders in accordance with our Board's direction. Third, we're going to focus on reducing debt levels. But with that, as you do that, you keep your balance, be strong and keep opportunities available, but that's where we'll be focusing. Randall L. Stephenson: It's right now I think we've been pretty clear that the next couple of years we want to get our debt levels back down to kind of more normal levels for us. We spiked them a little bit to get the spectrum bought last year and then also to do that DIRECTV deal. So we'll spend the next couple of years working the debt back down before we start talking about different capital allocations in terms of share buyback or anything of any magnitude. David Barden : And could we interpret that as being kind of relative to historical comments of being willing to bid for instance $9 billion in the 600 MHz auction, would those comments, Randall, suggest that maybe you're going to take a much more conservative attack as that comes up? Randall L. Stephenson: We'll see what the auction brings and then how everybody participates, but I haven't been bashful in saying if there's an opportunity to get another 2x10 at that spectrum, we would pursue it. And so we think we can do that within the guidance John has given here and execute on that, but we'll have to see, David. It's not yet to us really clear what the spectrum footprints are going to look like and whether you can piece together truly a ubiquitous 2x10 type footprint which is really important to us to be bringing another band of spectrum into our operation, it's going to be really important to have a ubiquitous broad footprint. And so we'll have to look at that and obviously we're going to have to look at the person, that bid that the government has just issued the RFP on. So there are a lot of ways we'll evaluate the spectrum scenario, but it's reasonable to assume that we'll be active one place or the other. Operator : Our next question in queue will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. James Ratcliffe : Two if I could. First of all, just to dive in a little more into the DTV integration, any incremental thoughts on sizing what the revenue upside there is? I know it's early but now that you have for example some track record regarding unlimited data and you'd be able to share data across the two operations. And secondly, any incremental thoughts and the status of sponsored data and how you expect to see that roll out over the course of the year? John J. Stephens: On the DTV integration and the revenue upside, let me frame it this way. We are pleased with what we have seen so far, specifically the unlimited data and the wireless I mentioned here. We had 500,000 wireless customers signed up for it already. So we're overall pleased with it. We think there's [great opportunity] [ph] there. The timing of those could give us a reason for some carefulness there for this reason. For example, Randall mentioned the training of our technicians who do the installs. We're just going through the completion of that now, and that's really going to be more off a second half of the year where we'll see how really effective that is. We have seen a lot more bundling of the satellite with broadband but we need some more time to make sure that we understand the momentum of that and the progress of that. Additionally, we are still going through the sales process of training our reps who never sold broadband when they sold satellite before or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before, and as Randall pointed out, because we sell wireless we have to increase all their sales activities, whether in the stores or in the call centers. So all of this is going to take some time for us to really track [indiscernible]. I will tell you, we are optimistic and pleased with the initial results but giving any guidance on the revenue synergy sort of perspective is a little premature. Randall L. Stephenson: On your question on sponsored data, James, I think it's important to think about what we have assembled here. And so between DIRECTV and our Otter Media relationship, we think we have the best premium set of content available to anybody anywhere and we're getting the rights secured to allow us to begin delivering this over whatever platform the customer wishes. If the customer wants it on a tablet or a smartphone or on a TV and we're getting to the place where we can do that. Now if you think about the most premium set of content, whether it would be sports programming, whether it would be binged type programming that has stacking rights and [look-back] [ph] capabilities, whether it would be movie libraries or whatnot, it's just a very, very robust set of content that we're piecing together here to be delivered. I think one would just have to assume that sponsored data would be a critical element on how the customer would take advantage of this. And so we haven't developed or announced I should say, we are doing a lot of work right now on how we come to market. We have not announced any plans but I think it would be reasonable to assume sponsored data would be a part of how our customers would take advantage of this kind of content library. Operator : Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Perhaps you could give us some sense of what you are including in 2016 guidance for realized synergies and any kind of expectation around what integration cost might be this year? And then Randall, following up on that content theme, maybe you can update us on the Otter Media and the joint venture with Chernin and any perspective on whether you want to get deeper into ownership of content more broadly? Randall L. Stephenson: Simon, let's say it this way, by the end of the year we expect to be on a run rate of $1.5 billion, which is going to be about $125 million a month. That's how we think about it. That's how we're doing our plans. I certainly don't mean to imply we're at that level in January, don't want to convey that, we're not, I don't expect that, but we expect it to grow throughout the year. We did have a very good first five months of getting costs aligned and addressing a lot of the administrative or headquarter some of the easier costs to start getting out. So we did well with that and we're making good progress on the content, and quite frankly are shifting to a satellite based customer base is helping. But from your question perspective, I would think of it in that way that we are going to hit and hopefully exceed the $1.5 billion run rate which will be $125 million a month by the kind of December timeframe, fourth quarter timeframe. With regard to any capital required for those integration costs, that's already included in the $22 billion of capital guidance. And from the expectation of integration costs, while we have some, without giving guidance, I would suggest to you this way, if you think about what makes up our integration savings or merger savings, content negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the cost to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it done and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger integration costs to be significant. I will tell you we're still going to have customer facing amortization, trademark, trade names amortization, those kinds of normal merger integration. We're pretty explicit with those in the details we provide in our filings. On the content side, and specifically you asked about [RV] [ph], that's going well. We're still early, but as everybody knows, we're partnered with Peter Chernin who I think probably is the best content talent on the planet, and early leveraging the Fullscreen acquisition that we did out of Otter Media, Fullscreen is obviously moving into a subscription model. We're really early to see how that progresses. But we're using that platform to do a lot of work for developing what I will call mobile centric content designed for the mobile device, and very optimistic about what the opportunities are there. In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas where we have what I'll call proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others we have acquired over the course of the last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content that is produced by us, everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth. And Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level and as we have success, you'll see us invest more in the areas where we have success, but right now I think our plate is full doing full-scale integration of DIRECTV and bringing it into the mobility channel. Operator : The next question in queue will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Can you talk a little bit more on the mobility side about deals with Ford and so forth? Does that include getting just maybe beyond new cars but also getting into the used dealership networks? And then on the Mexico side, can you comment on your aspirations for video with those customers there? Randall L. Stephenson: So the Ford deal is exclusively the cars coming off the manufacturing floor, and so those are new cars coming out over now in 2020. Like we said, we are expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford. You bring up an interesting point and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected and there is actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, old sports car that I now have connected to the Internet and it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there are some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in fact we are selling into the market today, to connect the used car fleet that is out on the U.S. roads and we think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. And so if you really want to grow this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. So that's a priority for us and you'll see us pursue that. On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, we are fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. and we're early on here in the U.S. but based on early success we continue to get more and more convicted, it is going to be an important category, bringing the two together is going to be important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S., we think it will be important in other markets and Mexico will be no different. As you know, we have a minority share position in a satellite company in Mexico and hopefully we'll be able to do some partnering there but we do think the video combination with mobile is going to be important in all geographies in all markets. Frank Louthan : At some point, does it make sense to take a larger position in that ownership? Randall L. Stephenson: I don't know if our partner has any interest in selling that position. So time will tell. We'll just have to see. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Just two if I could. First, the management in the past has discussed the investments in broadband within the wireline footprint over the last few years. Is there a way you can size the footprint where you've made the upgrades but you are underpenetrated for broadband share and help us think about the gap you hope to close given the speeds that you are now offering? And then if I could just throw in a second question, I was wondering if you could share some of the segmentation of how you spent capital in 2015 capital expenditures specifically and how those allocations might change as you look at the 2016 budget? John J. Stephens: Let me take a shot at this. With regard to our wireline footprint, we have about 60 million IP broadband enabled customer locations [indiscernible] from our consumer side and we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. So these are round numbers. The stat profile will give you the details. But with that, you can see that [indiscernible] penetration right now is about 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have a national video product in DIRECTV and a satellite product, and such that we didn't have that before. So many of our, if you will, broadband capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so as we improve this single [indiscernible] capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that share and we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today. With regard to the expansion that we are doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results and the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove I think to be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next four years when we will also get to \u2013 some of it will overlap but we will get to 14 million fiber-enabled and quite frankly there is a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we are finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue. With regard to the capital spend, you are right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spend because in our wireline and wireless footprint and we are an integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed backhaul to a sell-side or whether you are stripping wireless traffic or wireline traffic or an IP backbone. But from a general perspective, in 2015 we spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area, and if you will the [indiscernible] the shared services area. I will tell you that pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-top box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So, I'll give you that way to think about it and I think that will be kind of a consistent story as we go through in the coming years. We are investing at a rapid rate in all of our businesses. The one thing about our wireless business is when you've got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality service, at least our networking can do great service and continue to meet all the needs and you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there isn't investment, it's that much of this investment has been made over the last three years for the spectrum purchases through the VIP project putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities and we are going to continue that quite frankly with GigaPower as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can then give even better high-quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process but needless to say we continue to be very proud of the performance and continue to invest there. Randall L. Stephenson: Don't forget software defined networking continues to push capital requirements down over the next three or four years. We think it's going to be significant. John J. Stephens: Tony, we'll take one more question. Operator : And that will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan : Just a couple of follow-ups. John, so maybe just on the cash tax rate, can you give us maybe a little bit more color? I think Verizon said in the high 20% range. I know you've reported taxes of 35% over the next few years. There's a lot of moving parts. But is kind of mid 20% range look pretty good? And then a quick follow up for Randall. John J. Stephens: Tim, [we don't like to give that guidance] [ph] but let me say it this way. I can completely understand how Verizon or [indiscernible] a similarly situated company can get to that level. Timothy Horan : Got you. Randall, clearly there's unprecedented technological change of cloud and artificial intelligence and everything else going on and you've had a lot of your peers slash CapEx and OpEx spending and Sprint seems like they are really on the road to doing that right now, but we've had a lot of European carriers do the same thing. I guess the question I get a lot is, how much of a focus is that at AT&T and do you have confidence that you can kind of see some of these benefits? And I guess maybe in that regard, I know you have Project Agile out there, any kind of update on where you are in that process and ability to cut expenses, that would be great? Randall L. Stephenson: When you think about software defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies for DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate synergies, you think about all this going on and just the core business, you've got Project Agile John does where we are really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital, the opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of the business. I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible, even at a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our Mobility segment, our Entertainment Group segment, consolidated \u2013 I mean it was a clean sweep in terms of taking margins up and we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. And so we feel really good about the path we are on and the momentum we have on the cost side of taking cost out of the business. On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity that's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean they are here and they are ubiquitous, they are low latency, combine that with cloud, combine that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses, I mean the world of big data is here and it's available to everybody, and then sensors. The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in sensors at virtually no \u2013 I mean the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of these sensors, all of these, these four elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity and people are not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed, low latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with this sensor technology are going to miss it and we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all of this together and creating growth. We're going to invest through this cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers, we think that's going to be a huge opportunity, and expanding our footprint into Mexico. I mean all of these are converging we think to give us a growth platform for the next four or five years that is unique. So we're trying to be prudent, our downward bias on an incremental basis of capital. As we continue to emphasize that, we are being more and more efficient with our capital spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. As you deploy these 2x10 MHz blocks of spectrum, the efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant and we think we're in a very unique position in that regard too. So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that. So thanks for the question and I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We are off and running with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico, those are going well, and we feel good about where we are as a business and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest. John J. Stephens: Thank you all. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Michael Viola. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Viola : Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. It's great to have everybody with us today. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will cover our results, and then we will follow with a Q&A session. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That\u2019s ATT.com/investors.relations. Of course, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement before we begin. The Safe Harbor says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking; and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties, and results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website. I also want to remind you that we are in a quiet period for the SEC spectrum auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. Now, before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange. We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and after adjustments \u2013 and, by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. This strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw consolidated margin growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year, with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion. And so with that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John Stephens : Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call. As Mike said, we turned in another solid financial performance. Revenues grew, margins expanded, and we had our fourth straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband, and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing. What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses. We are on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We are also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives such as our Mexico operations. At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We\u2019ve been consistent on this for years, transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband-based IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We have done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do. Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers onto our new LTE networks and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All of this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. We\u2019ve built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We are very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business. Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our business solutions segment. Those details are on slide 6. Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business, and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total business solution revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains, as well as more customers on lower-churn business plans. Margins also continued their growth trend. EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team. Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments showed growth and our wholesale business is on plan, even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services. Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter, and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter. That is up 9.3%. And if you adjust it for foreign exchange, growth would have exceeded 10%. Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. We also are seeing continue demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks, given our unique experience. And our ability to provide business solution sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space. Now, let's move to our entertainment group results on slide 7. As a reminder, our entertainment group provides video, broadband, and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, entertainment group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at results adjusted to include prior-year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video, and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines. Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our add sales, which are now more than $1 billion annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year. Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total entertainment group broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We\u2019ve done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which helped drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband. We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of the year. And Fullscreen's ad-free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the new service, and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote the service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile and broadband customers. We are also seeing our broadband [audio dip] DTV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint has increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter with thousands more being added every day. These are some of our highest ARPU subscribers who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services. Our entertainment group team is performing well on every level : merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising, and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single truck rolls, cross-selling, and new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We are on track with all our targets, and we are very excited about what is to come. Now, let's move to our U.S. mobility results on slide 8. Another reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans, as well as adding new customers; while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. We have changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than two years ago with Next, and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working and you can see it in our results. Our laser focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins. Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the year-ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever. Phone-only ARPU plus Next billing continued its strong growth. This ARPU was up more than 5% year-over-year, and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device subsidy plan. During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no-subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were all on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher. Now, let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones, and tablets. Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid. That included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations, and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds. Cricket continues to be a great option for our value-focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter, and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow. We expanded our cricket to distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text, and data for $65 a month with auto pay, and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million connected device net adds, matching our best-ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth. In the first quarter, we also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year. On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base, and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network; and the spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base. Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 10. We continue the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying of 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services, and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they are adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter, and nearly 1.1 million in just the last six months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million. Rebranding is also gaining speed. We've launched nationwide advertising where branding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. And we are also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. First quarter revenue reflects seasonally lower equipment sales, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, as we successfully continue to execute our strategy. In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates significantly impacted our published results. Revenues are being hampered by a challenging economy. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds, but foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We did see sequential profitability trends in the quarter, and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year. Now let's move to consolidated margins on slide 11. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was a 110 basis point improvement over the year-ago first quarter. Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico. Our drive to have the industry-best cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess costs efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT rationalization, and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience. During the quarter, we also eliminated subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement, even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We are confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. Cash flows were another strong story. Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings, the margins - we also continued to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year-ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth-quarter payables. With these first-quarter results, we are on track to meet guidance, and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year. We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivables. We have received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter, or about the same amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter when we accelerated purchases of equipment to capture significant savings. On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last two quarters. But not captured in those costs are investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to a cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our non-wireless spending, and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy. With our industry-best cell density and balanced spectrum portfolio, we\u2019re adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry. Our virtualization and software-defined networks are already delivering material CapEx savings. We will be adding 2.5 times more capacity at 75% of the capital costs compared to just a few years ago. In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27 times. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt, and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates. We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we have laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent. We again grew revenues, expanded margins, and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly. And we\u2019re on track to deliver a run rate of $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans. Our business solutions segment continues to outperform the market with strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid perform. In Mexico, wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network. We are convinced our strategy is working, and our momentum is strong. We are proud of what we have accomplished this quarter, and even more excited about what lies ahead. With that, let's get to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Go ahead please. Mike Mccormack : Hi Guys, thanks. John, maybe just a comment on handset phone additions and postpaid, what strategies do you guys have in place to kind of turnaround or stem the losses there? I presume as the feature phone base continues to decline, that will become less of a headwind. And then just thinking about ARPU, I think the trajectory on phone on the ARPU without Next payments continues to get better. Is there a point at which you can see that starting to turn positive later this year? John Stephens : Yes, thanks for the questions Mike. Couple things; one, our strategies with regard to the overall business, but including our phone market is really on this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can combine or video and our mobility and our broadband; and as we see these values net to the customers, we are optimistic we are going to be able to continue to improve our business. One other point I will make to you, though, too, is with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in margins, it gives us the flexibility and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of customers that are long-term value-creating customers for us with these new margin standards that the team has set. So, we are real optimistic about being competitive. With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entree into a market that is significant, and, as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues. We saw it, as you can see, in the first quarter, and in ARPU. So we are very positive about that. We believe there is real opportunity to continue that. But we will continue to worry about performing first, and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic; we like what we see. We like what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings and the number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but added their tablets to the program. That was very encouraging, so we are really optimistic. Thanks for your question Mike. Mike Mccormack : Do you think that is having a negative impact on ARPU, if you think about the tablets coming on, as well is the bundled offers? Or is that not a significant impact? John Stephens : The tablets come on at $40 for the video offering, so they come in at a real strong rate. Depending upon whether they are a new and they are an addition, or whether they are a conversion of an existing tablet, you could have different impacts on ARPU. But we are certainly very pleased with those coming on. Mike Mccormack : Great. Thanks, John. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : John, could you just maybe frame the service revenue impact you talked about with the second-half shutdown of the 2G network? I think you said you have gotten back to flattish. Is that going to change the dynamic in the second half, first of all? And then second, upgrade rate was even lower than we thought, at 5%. Obviously that also helped the EBITDA margins. How should we look at that over the next few quarters, both, say, the second and third quarter? Obviously, fourth quarter is a little bit of a wild card. But do you expect the same kind of margins in those quarters that we - the strength that we have seen this quarter? Thanks. John Stephens : John, with regard to 2G, we have been on this path to convert our 2G customers for a number of years. If you recall, we first announced, I think a year and a half ago - or more than a year and a half ago - our plans for 2G. So we have migrated much of that base already, a significant amount. In fact, in the last 12 months, we have migrated something like 6 million customers off that base. And that has been flowing through the numbers that you have seen. So, we are working through that on a regular basis already. So that impact is included in the service numbers that we - service revenue numbers that we've reported and that we talk about going forward. So it is already in that; and because of that, we're going to be careful. But it is already in that optimism that we have. With regard to the upgrade rate, I could see it continuing to be very moderate until a new device, until a significant or iconic device comes out. Once that happens, it\u2019s a little bit unpredictable. But I could see this, a lower rate continuing throughout most of the year. John Hodulik : Got you. Okay, thanks. John Stephens : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hi guys, thanks. Similar theme, the overall video decline, a little better than we had expected; U-verse a little bigger; DTV a little better, so, two things : one, do you still expect that you can get to positive for the full year on the video numbers? And just confirm that that does not include the over-the-top product. And second, I have been under the impression that you are trying to stem some of the U-verse declines through some efforts. Is that still happening? Or are you going to sort of watch this tail off at this pace? Thanks. John Stephens : Thanks for your question Phil. First of all, folks, we want to keep all our quality customers and so we will do prudent, rational steps to keep all of our customers, and keep them as part of our AT&T family. We are interested in doing that in any event. With regard to the video perspective, let me give you this thought. In the second half of the year, we will have had the integration efforts really completed and fully ramped. So, single truck roll, which for example, we didn't really start training nine of our states in the Southeast region until this year. They have now been all trained. But we will see that start to - we are seeing it have improvements now. But as that becomes a normal part of the business over the next few months, and we get repetition with regard to the success base on that, and we continue to have all our sales channels fully up to speed and selling those territories as we add those single truck roll capabilities, we see real optimism on the second half of the year. Secondly, just from a traditional basis, I think the NFL package has a real positive effect on net adds, and it occurs generally in the second half of the year. And we think the ability to add further integrated products and expand our wireless bundling further will give us that opportunity to, for the full year, grow video customers. Phil Cusick : I'm sorry, just not to push, but you had guided to full-year video growth. Is that still the guidance? John Stephens : Yes. That's what I said. We are still getting there to total video growth. And we think those - the reasons I laid out; the fact the NFL contract comes really has impact on sales in the second half. The fact that quarter-over-quarter, every quarter since we merged, we\u2019ve increased satellite sales. The fact that the full single truck roll integrated sales, integrated customer service, will be most effective in the second half of the year will give us that ability to add video for the year. Phil Cusick : And it sounds like that does include the stand-alone over-the-top product, or it does not? John Stephens : No, we don't have - we have not made any predictions on the stand-alone over-the-top video product yet. And so we are expecting to reach positive with not including those numbers. Phil Cusick : Perfect. Thanks, John. John Stephens : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please. David Barden : Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. First question, John, would be just in terms of getting to the $1.5 billion synergy savings run rate by the end of the year. Could you kind of size what was this quarter, and what is on the come for the rest of the year? And then second, just on the unlimited, I saw in the disclosures that there's about 3 million unlimited customers. Obviously some of those are going to be related to the video bundle that you are doing. Could you talk a little bit more about the learnings, about what people are doing with mobile video, with an unlimited wireless capability? And what is the economic model that you see supporting giving away unlimited data for this purpose? Thank you. John Stephens : So, the first thing with regard to the $1.5 billion, we are making real progress on our content cost savings. We are getting those from new content - contract negotiations; as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our base is shifted more to DTV, and we get that from the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from our headquarters advertising the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together - those savings in professional fees and contractors in consulting fees settings - we are getting that. And then we are seeing some savings, and we would expect to see more as we go through not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' contracts, and best payment terms. So those are what\u2019s underway. We've been at this almost 9 months now, or a little over nine months, and it\u2019s going relatively well. We\u2019re encouraged, not only that we are going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we have the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece of it, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customer, most of those customers, were already buying a video product from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy the wireless, and they often buy the broadband, these are some very high ARPU customers, and customers that are very valuable long-term to us. And so, giving them this opportunity to use our services any time, any place, where they live and work is very positive for them and creates not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add video customers for the wireless customers who want to get this opportunity. Secondly, we are still in the learning stage of it. But we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic, or some number like that, is on Wi-Fi or it gets offloaded very quickly. So, while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it is going to be a manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we\u2019re going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have Wi-Fi supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success. But the real issue is when the customers are paying us for all those services, it makes real sense. We can really get comfortable with offering the unlimited. So far, it is working well. David Barden : Alright, thanks John. John Stephens : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Go ahead please. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much and good afternoon folks. John Stephens : How are you Amir? Amir Rozwadowski : Well, John. I was wondering if we could talk a bit about the standalone OTT offerings. You had mentioned in your prepare commentary that you have had some progress with the content partners. How should we think about the positioning of those offerings going forward in terms of potential opportunities set to either expand the addressable market for DIRECTV or, conversely, there have been some concerns that it could come in and cause some level of potential cannibalization for certain types of users. And then I've got a follow-up question, if I may. John Stephens : Yes, So the AT&T now and the AT&T mobile are really specifically - the DTV Now, excuse me, the DTV mobile - the DTV Now is really expected to look and appear and have a channel choices very similar to what we have on the traditional subscription DTV product today. The attractiveness for us is that, yes, there is a market of 20 million households that don't have it today. There is a collection of, if you will, core nevers, young people who have never had their own subscription that they might be able to get this. And quite frankly, the cost efficiency of being able to deliver it without having the cost of installation of a satellite dish or possibly a set-top box - whatever the cost that may be eliminated out of this - are really attractive and make it something that not only could grow the customer base, but also can be a very reasonable profitability for us. So, we believe that we are very excited about that opportunity, and it gives us a way to compete in different places, even those places where we don't have the broadband product in place. So, we are excited about that. Right now, the people who buy our DIRECTV and U-verse video products are the high-end customers who generally want a subscription video product in their home, with three or four televisions connected, and that variation. So it is a slightly different marketplace or different customer base with regard to DIRECTV Now. Likewise, we are excited about the opportunity to do it on mobility, and provide the DTV mobility to those customers who use mobile devices as their broadband alternative. With that being said, we are really excited about growing the market. And, at this time, we are excited about the ability to package a collection of content that is very similar to and very attractive to the customers that we would be targeting with this. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much. And then just a quick follow-up, thinking about the cash flow generation capabilities of the company at this level, you had mentioned you feel like you are on track when it comes to the synergies associated with the DIRECTV integration. There have been other cost synergy or cost reduction initiatives ongoing at the company for some time now, be it Project Agile or other initiatives. How should we think about the opportunities for improving the cash generation capabilities of the combined entity? John Stephens : Real simply, the numbers we have out in public was our Project Agile initiatives, which are going quite well. We are about $3 billion of annual cost efficiency, cash operating expense savings or cash savings. Our merger initiatives are $1.5 billion a year or more, once they get up to the run rate. As you have seen, we\u2019ve got software-defined networks which are really driving the opportunity to, if you will, reduce capital cost and reduce cash operating expenses from the ability to eliminate truck rolls and other installation costs. When you roll those up, it's pretty easy to take those public numbers we have given and get to a number that is a $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion opportunity, whatever totals you want to get to. That kind of opportunity is very exciting for us. We are striving and working very hard. If that is to occur, we will have a very strong opportunity over time to grow cash flow. Amir Rozwadowski : Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color. John Stephens : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Michael Rollins with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, can you give us an update on the initiatives that management discussed around deploying 40 megahertz of new spectrum to fuel capacity for the emerging video strategy and mobile broadband demand that you are seeing? And then secondly, if we can just an update on your thoughts more broadly on the strategy in Latin America, and how you perceive the need to [indiscernible], to either scale up or scale out of those markets over time? Thanks. John Stephens : So, with regard to \u2013 and I will stay away from anything with regard to the auction, as Mike mentioned at the first, can't make any comments with regard to that. Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started the IP some years ago, and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network, and particularly a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capabilities, and would be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily, as new technologies came along. With regard to having that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers, and as such, we are now in a position that with our 40 megahertz of WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we are now in that position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality, dense, fiber-rich network that we have already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time, and continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies. So we feel in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we started with some years ago with Project VIP, and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there, and getting a fiber-rich backbone out there support the backhaul for the right decisions that are really paying off with this, as well as the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS-3 spectrums. They are really coming into value for us in a very significant way. With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, we mentioned before \u2013 tough environment, but the team down there, we have been impressed with, they are operating very well. Brazil is a challenging environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well and the overall profitability is impressing us for a management team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results they are. We are focused not on customer accounts, but on profitable growth and quality. And quite frankly, we are recently encouraged by the change in some of the exchange rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, at closer to 3.5, you can look at where the Argentine peso is at 14.5; and even some improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico and the peso coming up, we are starting to see some light. It's very early, and so we will continue to work very hard to improve operating results. We will keep flexibility with it. We are impressed with the teams that are there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can. Michael Rollins : Thank you. John Stephens : Sure, Mike. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : I wanted to focus on the handsets a little bit more. Do you think the quality of the handsets have gotten better, so that the life can be extended here? And do you think customers are going to look to save money on handsets? And if so, can we see some elasticity in terms of service spending with you guys a little bit more? Thanks. John Stephens : Tim, the first thing is, to your first point, on the quality \u2013 I do think that is part of it. But what I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business, we\u2019ve seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment installment plan or the Next program. And so I think there were a lot of phones that were still very operable, very good shape, that were in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we\u2019ve seen the reuse of those phones extensively. We have seen our BYOD numbers grow from 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter, some years ago, to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified or best described by that. With that being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they are going to be very efficient. Last, I think that there are \u2013 it's a fluid market; and there is, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We are seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there is a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per-unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace, and they are impacting our equipment revenues, but they are impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of those go down, we certainly are striving to have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we will strive to continue to do that. We will see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, solid performance in our wireless service revenues. We are extremely encouraged by that. Tim Horan : Thank you. John Stephens : Thank you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks, two quick ones, one just coming to cash flow, and a statement you made earlier in your remarks about seasonality of payables. It looks like you used about $4 billion cash on payables. And I was just hoping we would get some color on how to think about working capital items impacting cash flow for the balance of the year. And then the 3 million subs who took the unlimited wireless plan, a lot of them were existing customers. It is generally ARPU accretive when the customers move into the unlimited plan? And since it is still ongoing, should we view that as a source of ARPU stability going forward? John Stephens : Good question, Brett. I think, Brett, you're looking at the cash flow statement and you're looking at that change in accounts payable. It was about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter and about a $4 billion impact this year. And you are looking at the right numbers. The reason that increased was twofold. We had the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx. There's a lot of equipment and a lot of inventory in the fourth quarter at very good prices and rates, and satisfying contractual commitments. Those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter. With that being said, we think that is a timing item, and we don't think it will have a permanent impact for the year. It will just reverse out as we go through, so that is it. We bought up some inventory, enhanced that to the other items, and we made some investments in equipment. So that is that aspect of it. That is why we are encouraged about free cash flow not only meeting guidance, but actually growing year-over-year. Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial times where that \u2013 many of them brought not only their device, their handsets, but their tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We are optimistic about that. But we are going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We did, though, get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we did get some new ones. And we are also very encouraged about that. And we are learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more \u2013 grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings. So, positive on both ends of your questions. Brett Feldman : Okay. Thank you. John Stephens : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go-ahead please. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot, John. You touched on GigaPower and the attach rates for your broadband. Can you just update us on the build out or is that going to be fairly linear? Where do you stand today in sort of the FCC commitments? And going back to the 2G decommissioning, perhaps you can just let us know how much spectrum is tied up in 2G that will get freed up by this initiative? Thanks. John Stephens : Thank you, Simon. On the GigaPower, I think we are at 1.6 million fiber-to-the-prem locations that are active and running today. We are on track with our FCC commitments and are confident we are going to meet those on a timely basis. And included in our CapEx plans for this year, and our longer-term multiyear plans includes fully funding all that activity, so we are optimistic about that. With regard to the 2G commissioning, the one item I want to make sure I am straightforward with is as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So, in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we have been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as we go as we have been able to free up spectrum. So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at my disposal, here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of cost that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network. And so we are anxious to capture that savings and use it to continue a strong EBITDA story for our wireless business, and a story that is coming from good quality network operations and efficiency. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. John Stephens : Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Go-ahead please. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little update, as you have been making the transition between the U-verse customers there, what is sort of the cannibalization rate between some of the DIRECTV and the wireline U-verse? And the same thing on the broadband, are you seeing a shift more to taking advantage more of the GigaPower and away from DSL? How much of that is just losing share? John Stephens : Yes, Frank. Thanks for the question. On the broadband side, Frank, we are through most of the opportunity of where they have DSL and also have the choice of either GigaPower or high-speed broadband products. About 95% have already transferred. So we have got some left. The rest of it is just a legacy DSL footprint. We will continue to support those. We will continue to try to provide good service to those customers. But, if you will, that trade-off has \u2013 the team has worked hard to get people to upgrade into speeds and to take advantage of our better-quality products and services. I think of that as a success. With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it is really the focus has not been so much about cannibalization as it is that the sales channel has been focusing on selling DTV satellite service. And the reason is, is because it is a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergy savings by adding the customer there. So, that's really what's going on. It's not so much a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift. It is more of getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly, when we have same desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do it is getting onto the lower cost structure. So, that is really the focus. We still get good Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U-verse platform, and we are still pleased to support both. I have U-verse in my own home, so it works very well for me. Frank Louthan : All right, great. Thank you. Michael Viola : Kathy, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from Amy Young with Macquarie. Go-ahead please. Amy Yong : Thanks. I was actually wondering if you could talk a little bit about your Mexico business. You had two quarters now of consecutive net add growth. What sort of trajectory should we expect going forward? I think in your commentary, you mentioned profitability improving in the back half of the year. What kind of metrics should we expect? Thank you. John Stephens : Thanks, Amy. We are not going to give specific guidance on customer accounts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we've made. And certainly when you have got two quarters in a row growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is this : one, we do expect at the end of this year we will have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring our total North American footprint to well over 390 million. So we will be at essentially 400 million POPs by the end of this year, but certainly by 2018 on the North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand, and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We have got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today and we expect it to be up to 160 by the end of the year. So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs, and getting the customer care service and the distribution at that same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we have just joined. So, you can understand why we are optimistic about it, and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It is a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market. And we think it is a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities. Amy Young : Great, thank you. John Stephens : Thank you, Amy. John Stephens : I think that will conclude our call for today. As we do, let me just close by saying thank you for your time. We appreciate your interest in AT&T. And as always, as you're going home tonight, please don't text and drive. The text can wait. Thank you, and take care. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and choosing AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. . I'll now turn the call over to your host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us today. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. We're going open with a summary of our results and then we're going to spend a little bit of time providing a strategic update of our business. We thought this would be a great time to just take a step back and look at how we've repositioned our company the last few years. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. You can find the material at www.att.com/Investor Relations. Now beforehand I hand the call off to John, I need to call your attention to one more matter. That's the safe harbor statement which is on slide three. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially, and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions and thus we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks, Mike, and hello everyone. And thanks for being on the call today. It's been one year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with their synergy targets. Our cost synergies are ahead of plan and we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting new streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown. We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by discussing our second quarter results, starting with our financial summary on slide five. Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw a growth in satellite video, advertising, and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. And, we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success-based compensation plan we have for our bargain floor (3:37) employees. We're please for our employees, all our employees, in that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders. Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best ever wireless EBITDA margins. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment. This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year to date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year to date. We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter, or about the same as last year's second quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions; those details are on slide six. Total business solution revenues were down slightly, due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign-exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. Business wireless revenues were up 2%, with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues. Looking at the customer segments, Small Business Operations continued to grow thanks to gains in wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business and FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic Business Services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis, and when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. Strategic Business Services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of Strategic Business Services and Mobility is changing the revenue mix in Business Solutions. Those two areas now make up more than 70% of Business Solutions revenues, and if you look at total data and wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next-generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment. Now let's move to our Entertainment group results on slide seven. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment group thanks to gains and satellite subscribers, broadband revenue, and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather/Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year-ago second quarter. We continued to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter, with IEP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year to date, and it's now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins on a comparable basis were up 90 basis points, and were up even more if you adjusted for the prior year pay-per-view event. Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net ads continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform. Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year. Now, let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on slide eight. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter. Both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion. Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially but were down year-over-year. At the same time, phone-only ARPU plus Next billing was up 2.5%, with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding on to their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments. About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong, with its second lowest ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower, and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%. Branded phone adds increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continued to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic-branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did a year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones. And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time, as feature phones transitioned to smartphones. We had another solid quarter in adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers. That includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller largely due to disconnects from our 2G network. Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by two events. First, we aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment. As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from one less network to support will be meaningful; so will the additional spectrum available to redeploy. Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide nine. Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country. Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network, and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City. Second-quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues. Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs, as the competitive environment has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics, however, we did see subscriber growth, adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter, in part due to the Copa America Soccer Tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continued to be profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter. Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January. That's on slide 10. We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expected to be at this time. Consolidated margins are stable, as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers. Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now, I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on slide 12. As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company strategy and direction. But today, we'd like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company, for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost-efficient way possible. This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets. No one else has our cost structure opportunity. And no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can. Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market-based compensation and benefit plans, and thoughtful debt management. For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market-based but also encourage employees to keep our owners' interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class board of directors, who provide great insight while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together. Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on slide 13. Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come. Here is what we've accomplished. First, we ratcheted up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial in getting the high quality, high capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated \u2013 fiber backhauled, deployed, and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor and our move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than one 1 million business locations to our fiber network and we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations. The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million fiber-to-the-home customer locations and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G. We've already filed patents. Trials are already underway, and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well. At the same time we launched VIP, we moved to expand our spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 MHz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 MHz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G. Last week's move by the FCC to make high-frequency radio spectrum available for 5G wireless service is another step forward, providing us more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid in the FirstNet process that is currently underway. Our network transformation is now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software. SDN gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capabilities. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provides cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on slide 14. Having an industry leading cost structure helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. We now have a line of sight to continue margin improvement as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals. Step one, is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion-plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way to hit our projected $2.5 billion-plus run rate savings by the end of 2018. Step two is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations, and other cost efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We also have not been shy about exiting non-strategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue but increases overall profitability. Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously required dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated teams. This virtualization manifests itself into real sustained cost-savings throughout the network and the business. That's savings in both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us, as well as better value on ours and our customers' hardware investments. Now, let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of the industry \u2013 our integrated solutions approach. That's on slide 15. While it starts with connectivity, and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful. We've talked about these assets, but let's bring this point home. We are in every major market in the U.S. with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else \u2013 that's in footprint and out \u2013 which helps us compete today but also positions us very were for 5G. And we're also the biggest TV provider in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer. DIRECTV now is scheduled to launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people who don't now subscribe to a video service and prefer a streaming option will be impressed. At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all business customers, from Fortune 1000 companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel. When you take our extensive fiber network, then layer on SDN, security and mobility, and new software-enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C-suite of a major company to the master suite of your own home, and anywhere between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic, and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be. Now before we get your questions, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the targets. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead in the move to software-defined networks. All this drives us towards an industry-leading cost structure. But we're most excited about what lies ahead. We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us. From the crews staffing our work centers to leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications company. Our differentiated position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident we can execute on our strategy and continue to build value for our shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. John, it looks like, in terms of the guidance as you kind of walk through it on slide 10, you're kind of tracking ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point in the year. As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base case expectation for the year versus the \u2013 or better part of the guidance that you were discussing? And then second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Could you talk about the relative economics of those two things? And are we looking at a net economic positive or negative trade-off when we look at that? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks. Thanks, David. Let me take the second question first. On the economics, so forth, the postpaid subs were losing a lot of feature phones. They're averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less, than ARPU, and have costs associated \u2013 the postpaid do \u2013 with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon the specifics, average ARPU, and much less \u2013 they're very, very small subscriber acquisition costs, upfront costs, maintenance costs by the very nature of being prepaid. So from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins \u2013 total EBITDA margins or service margins \u2013 you can see that growth, and you can see the level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are \u2013 and we're running the business on a branded basis \u2013 we think of branded customers and try not to make distinctions on classification. Really makes distinctions on economics, and I think it's showing up in our profitability. With regard to the variables in the second half, there's a lot of things that happen in the second half. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business. In our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come out and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now, and some of the over the top offers. So we'll have a whole host of things going on. I would just suggest to you we're very confident where we're at. We continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or different about the second half of the year. It's just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure we meet or exceed it; so we feel very good about we're at through six months. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: All right. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Mr. Cusick, is your phone on mute? Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you hear me, guys? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : We can, Phil. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. So, a little bit along the lines of David's second question, when would you expect we'd see more integrated promotions for video and mobile services? And you've talked in the past about having some excess margin to give up to drive faster sub growth. Do you feel like you've been doing that already or is that still pending? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks, Phil. So first of all, we have been doing some promotion, some offers, some marketplace adjustments based on how we look at the marketplace. So, some of that is already impacting our results, and we're still doing quite, quite well in margins with that. Secondly, our first integrated product, I'd refer you to is the 5 million customers who have already signed up who have a bundle of our in-home video product, whether it be U-verse or satellite \u2013 DIRECTV satellite \u2013 and our wireless. It's been successful. We've seen very positive results from our customers, so it is going well. You will see us continue to push that offering as well as others. And then, I would suggest to you you'll see more things come out as we roll out our over-the-top offerings and other aspects. But right now, we are seeing some improvement in our attach rate of IP broadband with our video sales. And that is improving as we see the trends for the last four or five months. And we would expect to see some continued positive bundling, if you will, of wireless and video, as we've already seen 5 million people sign up for it. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : John, you mentioned DIRECTV Now. What's the long pole for getting that out at this point? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : I think there is a whole host of activities going on. I would suggest to you it's this way. While I believe that everything is moving well and all on our timeline that we've targeted, the biggest guidance piece on it is going to be, we're going to want to make sure it comes out with high quality and high performance. And so, as we develop this and test it, that will determine its timeframe. We'll want to make sure when it comes out, it's the high-quality product. If you think about the technology development, that's on track. If you think about the assets we need to provide that, those have been acquired; those are on track. If you think about the contracts we need to get the stacking rights and digital rights, those are going well. It's just a matter of getting all of those things coordinated together and then make sure it's the highest quality product you can have at launch. But we are confident in that process, and feel good about targeting the end of this year to get that out. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Do you have a widespread beta product of that yet, even without all the content? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah, we are going through various levels of testing of everything, but we're not going through a detailed public discussion of that. But as you can imagine, we're going through a variety of levels of testing of that. But this is something we've been working on for a while \u2013 feel real good about. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. John, maybe pointing to the build-up of the $20 billion free cash flow number on slide 14, it looks like you're at about a $16 billion base in 2016 here. You've got another $1.0 billion in synergies and another $1.5 billion in Project Agile. Is the rest \u2013 come from virtualization over that period? If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine you'll be paying some more taxes over time as well. So, how does it all fit together to sort of bridge us to that $20 billion number? And then, as you talked about in the \u2013 some previous slides, you're a little bit \u2013 you've underspent the $22 billion bogey on CapEx a little bit here in the first half. Does that mean there's \u2013 we have a sort of downward bias to CapEx at this point? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks, John. A couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow and you think about the $15.9 billion that we started with last year, and you add in the kind of the $2.5 billion dollar opportunity with DIRECTV. You add in the \u2013 with the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is an illustrative, reduction in capital intensity and some costs \u2013 some cash operating expense savings \u2013 you can see that those three items there can get you well over $5 billion. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so, when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, real, realistic path from last year's $15.9 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so, that's what we are looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow. With regard to our CapEx, just want to be very straightforward in the sense that we are at $10.3 billion, and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We will continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards a, what business cases make sense, and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in CapEx, like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first six months this year, we spend at a lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first six months is a trend to \u2013 on the low end of our guidance. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Go ahead, please. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, thanks. Hey, John, just maybe a couple of things. First, going back a little bit on the postpaid handset side. It looks like \u2013 obviously, feature phones have come down dramatically over the past eight quarters or so. As that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? And obviously, you've got DTV cross-selling, DTV Now products rolling out, or over-the-top products rolling out. I presume that could also help. And then, just secondly on the video adds for the year, the anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV continues to ramp? You've been doing a great job, but is it that or is it U-verse becoming less of a headwind in the back half of the year to get to a positive video number? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks, Mike. First of all, on the postpaid handset side \u2013 or on the handset side \u2013 we do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices, but our feature phones are going down and as they go down and that, if you will, legacy product, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened, certainly we have a brighter opportunity \u2013 a better opportunity to grow out of those customer base. And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single-truck install, which may be bundling of video and satellite and broadband, but also, that whole activity of bundling, the more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that'll provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless. So all three of those things will help, and yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers that are the most profitable, the highest quality. With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. We see more pressure in the second quarter than the first half from the U-verse side. And from, and quite frankly, so has DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see \u2013 we'd expect to see \u2013 some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL Ticket Sunday, and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving an attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good afternoon, John and Mike. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Hi, Amir. How are you? Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. John, so if we can touch upon that bundling question a bit more. If we go back to last year at the analyst update, post the close of the DIRECTV deal, you had highlighted some potential areas for revenue synergies driven by some level of cross-pollination of your respective customer bases. And I was wondering, where are you folks along that line? You had highlighted like there were, I believe, 15 million DIRECTV homes that don't have AT&T wireless, for example. Other opportunities seemed to be broadband plus video offering. Are you still at the early stages of that deployment? I'm just trying to assess, sort of, what kind of runway you do expect from a bundling opportunity perspective? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah, Amir, I would suggest we're at the early stages when you think about getting the workforce trained in all aspects of being able to cross-sell and do the bundling in the cross \u2013 and do single-truck roll installs and so forth \u2013 it takes a while. We have that completed; we have that process. But even as they all have been trained and they've all started to do it, it still takes some time \u2013 even with the great workforce like we have \u2013 to get really proficient at it. And we'd expect to start seeing that, as we've said all along, show some benefits in the second half of this year. But once again, I would suggest to you, the team's done a really good job of doing the bundling between wireless and the video products alone. And getting 5 million of these customers to sign up for this bundled approach with regard to video and wireless, is just the best proof I can offer you that we've already done, they've already accomplished, that this works and that we have a real opportunity to exceed our merger integration synergies because we'll have an opportunity to add revenues to those. Well, most of those synergies were really focused on costs. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. If we look at the current U.S. mobile competitive environment, one of your competitors notably instituted a price increase, which can somewhat imply a belief that the competitive landscape is not as pronounced as it once was. If we look at your service revenue trajectory in mobile, we still see some impact from stable declines in ARPU. Is there potential opportunity for adjusting pricing, particularly around bundled offerings or anything along those lines that could provide some relief to the trajectory of service revenue there? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Well, Amir, once again, let me point you to kind of a complete picture of that. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPU's right at $70 on a per-customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are really impressive levels, very good for us historically from any measurement \u2013 our straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days, or in the most recent years, with the equipment installment. So, on a monthly basis from our customers, we're doing very, very well with the revenue base. Secondly, it is a competitive environment, and it will \u2013 and it has been for years \u2013 and it will remain that. We believe that we are doing well with that, and we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, and in our cash flows. I will tell you just one side item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We had about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, can we connect them to your network? Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And depending upon what package they show up, they'll show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable. They're low cost. We love them. That doesn't necessarily show up in your immediate look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So, I would ask you to focus on those items as well as our service revenues. Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift to Mobile Share Value. I think we went from about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the \u2013 shift to the no-subsidy plans \u2013 which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives, credits, free services \u2013 normal promotion activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected. With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We're just focused on getting the best quality customers and providing really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reasons to be real careful and watch how the market develops, and be ready to prepare and lead, quite frankly, in a market with the performance that we've got. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the incremental color. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go now to Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thanks very much. I'd also like to add a competitive question to the mix. Typically, of course, the second half, the fourth quarter, a little bit more competitive. Do you feel like you are going to be as competitive as you've been last year? Is the goal to increase the number or the mix of net adds that you retain relative to where you've been over the past couple years? Just in general, how you feel about your subscriber base and your mix of net adds would be great. And then, secondarily, if there's anything then you can share on where in your CapEx budget you have been able to do better, whether it's labor or equipment or what have you, that would be super helpful. Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Okay. Well, the second one first. On the CapEx budget, we've done well, kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to \u2013 because of our software-defined network \u2013 we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity and the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do. I will tell you, though, that one of the things I think people miss out on is that because of the spectrum that we've invested in over the last, say, five years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying spectrum, and that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so, on a per-unit of capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit. From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well, and quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So, that's great. And then of course, some of the premier customers in the video space are using our U-verse and our DTV services. So, we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focused on that but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics \u2013 the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over the top versus monthly subscription \u2013 are less important as the economics of the profitability of those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, John. So that sounds like you are perhaps expanding the range of subscribers that you might defend or target than you might have \u2013 than relative to last year. If that makes sense. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Well, I'll say it this way. When your margins expand as much as ours have \u2013 about 130 basis points in both EBITDA service and, for example, in wireless, or in total margins \u2013 you have more room and more customers fall within that profitability level that are appropriate. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That's well said. Thank you. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah. That's really what's going on. The team's done such a great job expanding margins, they've created more room to be competitive. It's the team's credit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. John, you noted that you're on track to deploy fiber to 12.5 million customer locations. You have 12.6 million IP broadband customers today, but there are 60 million homes in your wireline region that could get a broadband line. So I'm curious, as you're doing the fiber deployment, how are you deciding which are the right homes to upgrade in terms of whether you should simply upgrading existing customers or how do you determine whether it's a business case to go to some of those homes that you don't serve and deploy fiber there? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : There's two things that \u2013 I mean, the first thing I'd tell you, Brett \u2013 is that the ability to build the fiber to the home is a larger footprint than just the 60 million. So we can take the economics of going into some appropriate customer basis, whether it's an opportunity for real \u2013 better economics, better profitability. So, we have that kind of business-case process to it. Secondly, I would tell you that with regard to the FCC agreement, there's particulars within the agreement that allow us to build \u2013 count so many greenfield builds, count so many more upgrades in the existing IP broadband footprint \u2013 to utilize in some cases multiple dwelling units, and then in many cases require some level, or a significant level I should say, of new builds. So, we have to coordinate all of that, take all of that into consideration. When you're done with that, you may still have some profitable builds that are at or above the 12.5 million commitment and you may go ahead and build those. We'll see where that goes over time and we'll see where that leads us. But the ability or the schedule to build is an economics activity, a business-case activity with, of course, the opportunity to over-build in some areas being probably more timely and less expensive. But that might be capped by some of the regulatory agreements that we have in place, and we're going to certainly be respectful of those. But overall, it's kind of a normal business-case process and where we can serve our customers the best and get the best returns for them and us. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And just as a follow-up to make sure I heard that right, I think you said that you are considering taking fiber outside of your traditional wireline region if the business case makes sense. Is that \u2013 did I hear that correctly? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : We've already done it. We've already done that in many cities. So, I don't want to suggest to you that we haven't. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: How do you pick those markets? Are these places where maybe you've already done a lot of fiber for your LT networks so it's a natural extension or are there other characteristics that tend to be appealing? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Just customer characteristics, competitive situation, access to other facilities we might have, a whole collection of considerations, whether it's a technology corridor like Raleigh-Durham or other such considerations. But that's a normal business-case process for us. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, got it. Thanks for taking the question. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Good evening, John. So, going back to the presentation a year ago, one of the things that you said you were working on was a home media gateway. And I know there's a bit of product development in that, but perhaps you could just update us on how that's looking, when we might start to see that getting deployed? And then there's a lot going on in Washington and obviously you can't talk about the auction, but maybe you could just give us some of your perspective on some of the agenda items at the FCC around special access, set-top boxes, privacy, et cetera, and any exposure you see there? Thanks. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah. So set-top boxes, we have commented on that \u2013 the industry's commented \u2013 and there's been significant support, I think, from Congress on that. So, I think that we would expect, we would hope \u2013 we've seen the people coalesce and we'll see some changes into what the initial FCC guidance was on that. On the special access piece, we think there's competition across the marketplace today. We see it and we would think that any kind of additional regulation of products that are already competitive will stifle investment and won't be good for consumers or businesses or the overall economy; so we think that's, if you will, headed in the wrong direction. We'll continue to present our case on that. On Title II, we always expected the final resolution to be in the hands of the Supreme Court and we'll work through the process and follow the Supreme Court process closely, and then make our decisions going from then on. I would suggest to you those are really, kind of my comments on all of those matters. With regard to assignment of the home media gateway, I'd suggest to you this aspect, that we continue \u2013 and I'm not going to be able to give you a detailed answer, I'm not going to try to, on a home media gateway. But what I will tell you is that we continue to believe that as we go through the process we can get cost synergies in DTV by standardizing the interfaces, whether they get the video over the satellite, whether they get it over the broadband or whether they get it over the IP television. And we continue to work on those activities, to standardize the graphic use interface, the set-top boxes and what you, what many would consider a gateway or a home gateway, for media. Those activities continue to be on and we'll continue to work for that. It's a natural efficiency and it's also a really good quality service for the customers. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. It sounds like that's a sort of, still a medium-term item? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yes. I would not suggest it's a near term item. I'd have to be honest. And I will go back with my team and follow-up on that, but right now I would suggest it's a medium-term. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Kathy, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Then the final question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Two quick ones, if you don't mind. John, can you give us a sense of what your services-only ARPU is, or if I bring my own device, what that is? Because I know my own children, they've been blowing through their data usage since they got out of school and that's a lot of new applications out there. Can you maybe talk about how much the current data volume growth can drive ARPU growth, in your opinion, over the next few years? And then I just had a quick clarification. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Yeah. So Tim, certainly we are seeing buckets get bigger for our customers. We are seeing their demand so we're optimistic about that opportunity. We're careful about it because of the competitive environment and responding to, or at least understanding how competitors may respond to what we've done. So certainly, the data growth, as we spelled out in our slides, the data growth continues, and for us, as an integrated carrier with the backhaul and the fiber and the extensive number of towers and spectrum, we feel really good about our competitive position. The question of how quickly we can get our data growth, or at what percentage that will be, will be a function of both the efficiencies we're putting into our data delivery as well as customer demand and competitor pricing. But, yes, there is absolutely a lot of growth in demand and usage, and we hope to capture that in additional revenues as we go forward. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, and I think John Hodulik said you were halfway through your DTV synergies and Project Agile. Is that correct? John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : We're on track to get to the $1.5 billion \u2013 we say $1.5 billion-plus \u2013 run rate by December this year. So I don't want to suggest to you that that's the number for the year. It's the run rate at that level. We'll get to it in December, and so we feel really good about where we're going for next year and the year after. And getting to the $2.5 billion run rate in 2018 is our guidance, so that's that piece of it. We are on track to get about half of those Project Agile savings today. That is correct, and we said that in the prepared \u2013 that'll be in the script. That's in the prepared remarks. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks a lot. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : Sure. John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP : With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today, and let me just give you a few closing comments before we go. It's been one year after our acquisition of DIRECTV and we are very pleased with where we stand. The integration of DIRECTV is on track. Cost synergies are ahead of target, and we've added nearly one million satellite customer since the merger. And our new streaming services are scheduled to come online later this year. We believe our unique assets, our leading cost structure and our ability to offer integrated solutions positions us like no one else. We think this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward. As always, on your way home tonight, remember: When it comes to texting and driving, it can wait. Thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening. Good night. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 2016 AT&T's three quarter earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. As you know, on Saturday we announced an agreement for AT&T to acquire Time Warner. And the purpose of today's call is to provide additional background and perspective. AT&T also announced its third quarter results on Saturday, and we'll briefly go over those highlights as well. With me on the call today are Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner; John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call is David McAtee, AT&T's Chief Counsel, who will take part in the Q&A portion of this call. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. It says some of our comments today may be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of AT&T and Time Warner's websites. As you know, we are in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. I also need to \u2013 want to direct your attention to page 4, as that has information regarding SEC filings and now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have. Look, we're convinced this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our two companies. Vertically integrated, we'll be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors, as well as advertisers. We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment with terrific brands and their brands we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library and we believe it's the best on the planet, and hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry. When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale and distribution, we have 100 million plus TV, mobile, and broadband subscribers. You put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special and it creates significant strategic as well as financial benefits. With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription, as well as adverting models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content, this design for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Only content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the cost of content creation. And this two-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen. We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017, and I've been asked a lot why now. It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging, and Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry and help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized, and social. The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly two and a half years into integrating DIRECTV and that work is going to be essentially behind us. Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals. The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the amazing creative talent, the journalists that they put together. That's why we plan to run Time Warner the same way that it's run today. If you would turn to slide 6 in the deck and let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the number one global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Brothers is the largest film and studio in the world, hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice, and box office hits like American Sniper, and it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet. Turner has top-rated basic cable network, TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Tuner's premium sports rights, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights of the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, CNN.com. If you look at slide 7, we'll have unmatched scale in distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America, make us the world's largest pay-TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers, and we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also our joint venture with The Chernin Group, Otter Media has 1.2 million subscribers on its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points-of-sale across North America. And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights, and we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch, when, where, and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow two-sided business models, help pay for the cost of content creation. And this two-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content. If you move to slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. Then later John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this. So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward and we think they're significant. In the first year after closing it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit metric. The approvals are fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And then we'll have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU, and a few other countries. And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and let him take you through his slides. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies, as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications. And that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders. This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. For Time Warner shareholders, the price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19, and it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company, with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies. We believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come. We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth, since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going, and that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multi-platform, and it's increasingly on-demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband, and this aligns us with all of that. Additionally, there is the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation. And that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits, but also content and programming that really engages with targeted passionate niche in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice. So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction. As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer efforts and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous, multi-platform, on-demand, and increasingly mobile environment. So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to slide 10. To recap, the purchase price values Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50 :50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded, with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity. We remain strongly committed to maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential, given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5 times range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8 times range by the end of year four. We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year three. As you would expect, this is substantially cost-driven corporate and procurement type expenses, the kind we know how to get. But we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers, but will allow more informed and efficient content development. This transaction also diversifies and enhances our revenue mix. Strong cash flow and the lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses. As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year, and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same timeframe. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting 100% raising the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record. Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on slide 12. Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless legacy services and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat. We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year to date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continue to be solid, even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico. Thanks to the team's focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins. All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second highest ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow. Year to date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full-year guidance. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year to date. We also continue to focus on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24 times. Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn, and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions eat it up at the end of the quarter. We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year ago third quarter, and this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration. Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago. We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million. The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We added more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers. Turning to our Entertainment Group, on a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in this year's results. Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year. Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter and we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business, and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1% and when you adjust for APEX, growth was closer to 10%. Let me close with a summary of the quarter on slide 14. We're proud of what we've accomplished in this quarter. Earnings continue to grow and consolidated margins are stable, even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4% and we had the second highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second best ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers at positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000. The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would. We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story, just a tremendous job by our team. They're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts, and with customer growth. Our guidance for the year remains on track, double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%. As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results and we look forward to finishing the year strong. With that, I believe we're ready for Q&A and I'll turn it over to Roxanne. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to start our Q&A session. We'll start with the line from Amy Yong, Macquarie Research. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. I was wondering if you can elaborate on some of the consumer products that you're envisioning on over-the-top. Obviously, you have DIRECTV Now, you have HBO GO. What do you think consumers want going forward? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Amy. This is Randall. I'll tee it up and I may ask Jeff to chime in, if he wants to add anything. So, you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we will be putting in the marketplace, but I would tell you the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform, as you think about incorporating social into the platform. And as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being social media. We think that \u2013 we don't think \u2013 we know our customers are really demanding that. Now, what I would tell you is, trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's length negotiation and people are, obviously, very protective of their content, and so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about, when we talk about this transaction is, now, in these over-the-top environments and platforms, we can begin to innovate our content much quicker. We're under the same umbrella, the same ownership structure, and we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you, we are both convinced that as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on this platform. So, those are kind of \u2013 a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to that? Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: I'd like to add same idea. We've been trying, at Time Warner, to get more Video on Demand on not just our networks, but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television and that whole dial of networks, hundreds of channels, they should all be VOD, just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks to turn on HBO more than five years ago, no payment extra. The condition was, we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms, provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody has got to get the same offer and we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first with Comcast years ago. What we saw, to Randall's point, is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often the reason was they're waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering. It's what consumers were demanding. And so, we think with this, with the AT&T and DIRECTV our largest affiliate distributor on television, they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when we want to bring more packages, more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower, more channels, fewer channels, more mobility, more innovation of the kinds of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They get less interruptions. And it means that more of the cost of the programming, which is \u2013 there's an investment in programming, but more of the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So the benefit for this, for consumers is pretty good, very good, and the benefit for advertisers is terrific, because if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the \u2013 has been gaining all the traction, but now you have yet another advertising choice that's equally efficient. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: And if we're right about this, and I think we're both really convicted that we can drive the industry and innovate in the industry this way and do it far more quickly. If we're right, as we begin to stimulate even more and more demand of video over-the-top on our mobile networks, the desire and the incentive to go faster on 5G deployment is heightened. And we get more and more enthusiastic about the world of 5G. The more we get into this and see what kind of services will be consumed over-the-top on our mobile network. So, it's just a real synergistic effect across everything from infrastructure investment back through the distribution platforms and content creation and advertising model, this just has a lot of opportunities for us. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question then comes from the line of John Hodulik, UBS. Please go ahead. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a question for Randall. We've heard the wireless market continues to see increasing competitive pressure. Does this transaction help you in that arena at all? Does it help you differentiate the product or just provide you some sort of business diversification away from the wireless market? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: It accomplishes both actually. As we iterate quickly on these platforms and think about DIRECTV Now, DIRECTV Now is a mobile-centric product. And if this product is as good as we believe that it is and our customers really begin to enjoy it, there should be advantages of using DIRECTV Now on AT&T's network, and there will be. But at the same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well. And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate with the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that if we're successive with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So, I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner, and which is media and entertainment. So the diversification is great. But I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our platform. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: John, if I could add just one thing. I mean, it is a competitive environment in the mobile arena. But look at the results, record 50% wireless service margins, churn our second best third quarter ever, and even lower when you take into account the 2G migration. Look at the postpaid phone churn and you see that it's down at 0.9%. So, it is a competitive environment and there are a lot of promotional activities going on. But our mobility engine, our mobility team is performing quite well. And the capabilities that we get through this transaction only ensure that that part of our business can continue to operate very effectively, efficiently, and profitably. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays Capital. Please go head. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for taking the questions. While some of the major trends that the combination seems to address are not lost on many, I wonder if we could dig in a bit more. Randall. to your comments on why now is the right time. Clearly, you have a lot on your plate at the moment. The integration with DIRECTV seems to just be getting started. You're on the verge of some new business models that you have mentioned on the OTT side. And arguably the revenue synergies have just begun with respect to DIRECTV. Does this signal confidence in your ability to execute on the integrated service provider model that is in place now or is this sort of timing with respect to availability of making this move with respect to the availability of the asset? Thanks. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Amir. Good questions. In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of cost out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those costs synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we've put together here, closing end of 2017 timeframe, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth. The other element that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over one year into this, and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going into that. And now we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you the more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up. So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is very good bringing it in end of 2017, and we're going to be at a place where all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing one truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. And so a lot of what I'd call the key logistical difficult things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 2017. We still have some what I'll call big IT type things, information technology development that won't be completed. But those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time. Then lastly, I would tell you a deal like this, when Jeff and I met and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of the possible here as we put these two companies together, and we both became convinced and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kinds of deals you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. Once you have a deal and you have a deal structure, given the potential for leaks and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's exactly what we did here. And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this. But actually, I think this fits very well with our own integration plans, and I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually works out quite well. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And if I may, one quick follow-up. What gives you comfort on the regulatory approval process? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: So I'll lead in on this. I have David McAtee, who is our General Counsel at AT&T. And so I'm not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I'll play one on TV, okay? But I'll give you my layman's assessment of why I got comfortable with this, and then I'll let David clean up after me. But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every definition of the word, as a vertical merger. It's a vertical integration. And most of the deals, in fact all of the deals that have gotten in trouble lately over the last few years have been horizontal mergers, where a competitor has been taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were concerned that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with those, are remedied or addressed \u2013 those concerns are addressed through conditions. And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that these type of issues can be handled with conditions, and it's rare. In fact, I'm not sure we know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors. David, would you have anything to add to that? David R. McAtee II - AT&T, Inc.: Randall, that's right. What you've heard here today, Amir, is that in the mobile age, the legacy separation between content and distribution is really getting in the way of what consumers want. And it's only benefiting those entrenched incumbents who have little interest to change. And so as a result, we are looking forward to the regulatory process, which is going to be guided by facts and guided by the law. And Randall is right. When you look at the modern history of media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like this, and they do so for good reason. They put downward pressure on consumer prices. They increase competition and consumer choice. And in our case, they spur the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and Jeff have talked about. So we enter this process confident. We don't prejudge the outcome. We stand ready to talk to the regulators and to address any concerns they have. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: This is Jeff. The only addition I'd add is it will increase competition in advertising as well. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Amir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you very much. I am joined by Ben Swinburne here, who also has a question. Randall, you moved into content with Otter Media and the partnership approach, and you've been pursuing that road, and there are obviously some benefits to that approach. What was it that made you feel comfortable that you could move from a partnership so quickly to full control of a content company of the size of Time Warner? And then, Ben? Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Jeff, good morning. I just was curious. If you look at over the course of your leadership time at Time Warner, you had a lot of success creating value spinning off and distributing assets, most notably Time Warner Cable in 2009. At that point, it seemed that the company had a strong view that content and distribution together was not synergistic. So I'm curious over the last seven years, what's changed in your mind to suggest now that combination is in fact attractive for your shareholders? Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: Randall, do you want me to go first? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Jeff, you start off. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: So two things. One is that the Time Warner Cable company and footprint was small. It was a regional cable company with the limitations that cable had at that time, about 12% of the country. And we weren't \u2013 that's the first part. And it needed to get consolidated to get more efficiency in the scale of what it did. And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval, as part of a media company that we had at that time. The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place. You've got broadband distribution. You have mobile as an ever-bigger part of the distribution package, and you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, across broadband, and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides, and it allows us to have our networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry \u2013 not AT&T and not Comcast, so far they've been good at this. But a lot of the distribution companies, particularly the cable companies have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers, and we think this will help spur that across the industry. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Furthering on Jeff's point and addressing, Simon, your question, the reason we believe that owning the content is so critical. When you're talking about doing really tight integration, ownership is always best. If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do in a partnering arm's length negotiated-type transaction. Our history is long in terms of examples of this; not the least of which was we had been, what I'd call, a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part of our package. But you never could get the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated. And then within one year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working three or four years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers. And we have been working aggressively to put this together and getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those great content agreements that we now own at DIRECTV, within one year we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year, something we've been trying to do three years we achieved in one year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content to our customers and really integrate \u2013 I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure, will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe if we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate faster and everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in this same way. So there's a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner, you can get there. It's slow, it's painful, just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Simon. Operator : Our next question then comes from the line of Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Randall, can you update us on the pace of improvement and the competitive environment in Mexico? And can you talk about what the Time Warner deal does \u2013 what Time Warner does in Mexico and the rest of Latin America and how AT&T can push that harder? Thanks. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: You bet. Mexico is going great. I think something that's been lost in the Mexico story is, Mexico City is like the largest \u2013 one of the largest cities in the world. It's a sprawling major metropolis. And we have stood up in the course of one year a full scale LTE network that is performing beautifully. And the business in terms of subscription growth continues to grow. Our distribution is growing beautifully. We're adding distribution at a very, very impressive pace, and that is individual who is leading that operation is just doing a terrific job. And I will tell you, we just continue to gain more and more conviction around Mexico. And we have a long way to keep growing in this business and we're looking forward to now, as we scale our mobile subscriber base, as we scale the LTE platform and get really robust capacity and coverage, then you can begin to think about the things we're talking about here, distributing content to our customers in Mexico. And Jeff has probably one of the best lineups of content in Latin America that I've got to tell you, we're really enthusiastic about not just for Mexico delivering over our mobile platform, but throughout Latin America, where we have coverage in just about every \u2013 I think all but two countries in Latin America with our satellite product. And so Jeff, if you would, I'd let you talk a little bit about the capabilities you have in Latin America. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: Thanks, Randall. Our biggest overseas network business and sales business in Latin America, from Mexico all the way to Argentina, that's where we have \u2013 we're the number one non-local channel provider across all of Latin America. We've got it on satellite with you at DIRECTV. We've got it in pretty much most of the cable and telcos. There is not yet as much broadband or mobile as there will be, but there is a real growth in that market. We also have a \u2013 we don't just have the U.S.-based networks like Cartoon, CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO that you all know. We also have a number of Latin American-based channels that strengthens our offering. So I think the match between the two of us in being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular take-up in Latin American countries of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 years ago. Now, it varies from country-to-country, but potentially all that growth of the golden era of more channels and more TV is coming now across Latin America. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, Jeff. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Phil. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. I understand from press reports, Jeff, that you plan on leaving the Time Warner organization. Randall, could you talk a little bit about how the leadership will work for the new company in this kind of bolt-on structure? And then second, John, on the financing side, could you talk a little bit about the comfort level the rating agencies have with your proposed leverage and some of the funding rate assumptions that you've made in your accretion analysis? Thanks. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: Randall, do you want me to start? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I want you to start. What are your plans, Jeff? Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: This is Jeff. I don't know where you saw that. That's not right. I'll be staying after we close the deal. And we do have pretty deep bench of management at the Time Warner Company. Everybody is going to be staying and quite invigorated, both the business execs, the creative and journalism executives, and I too will be staying. So as any normal evolution over the years after that \u2013 years we're talking about \u2013 our next generation will be ready. And you've got some terrific execs at AT&T and in DIRECTV that can be part of this next wave of management. But that's the next generation and when it's ready, we'll hand over to them. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: And as Jeff and I were constructing this deal, there was not a single conversation we had, where I didn't talk to Jeff about talent. And keeping the talent in place was a critical piece of putting this deal together. And Jeff has an employment structure that is really comforting to me in terms of how he has his people compensated and so forth. David \u2013 and I know this will probably come as somewhat of a surprise to you, but I've never run a movie studio before. And so keeping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, and it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how we affect the data beginning to influence content and how we allow the data and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner advertising avails and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there is a lot of integration work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be operated largely independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T. John, you want to talk about the rating agencies? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure, thanks, a couple things. Rating agencies, we've had conversations with them. They're still considering in the push and pulls of the situation. One is the amount of debt is large and we're all aware of that. On the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion, so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt. Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will, the diversification opportunities that this provides and the growth, the enhanced growth opportunity that provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year kind of in the 2.7 times range net debt-to-EBITDA and getting down to close to our traditional target of 1.8 times after four years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment-grade and would argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that will \u2013 as they work through the analysis, this is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% -- or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates with about a 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time. So first point I make to you is, this transaction really doesn't have \u2013 has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T, and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step up from a 30-year bond rate that we see today. We took a step up from that in our models in our traditional normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental. And as I said, the basis is locked up for a long period of time. Thanks, David. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan, Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. John, just two questions following-up on that. So in today's current rate environment, if you use more short-term debt, what type of rates do you think you can get? And secondly, just on the \u2013 can you give us maybe some color on the cash tax rate going forward? And just a quick follow-up for Randall. Thank, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, a couple of things. One, if you look at our overall average debt cost today, it's about 2.5% after tax. So pretty low, and that's with the longer term life, that's with the kind of 14-year average life. I think, Tim, you can see, it can certainly come below a 4.5% or 5% rate. You can certainly get down to the 3% on some of the short-term \u2013 shorter term debt and even lower, depending if you \u2013 how you want to go to floating. We're going to work out the syndication of the bridge loan in the coming days and weeks, and we'll finalize that, but I want to make sure we are viewing this as a longer-term step. So we're not looking and the deal is not based on getting short-term rates for the next few years, but there is opportunity there compared to our assumption. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And the cash tax rate, John? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah. I think on the cash tax rate, if you see the \u2013 the cash tax rate is going to stay very low through the bonus depreciation years. And if you look at Time Warner, their cash tax rate \u2013 their effective tax rate is lower than ours. Their cash rate is slightly higher than ours. So over time we would continue to expect the cash tax rate to be below the book effective rate. And on a post-merger basis, the book effective rate will be lower than AT&T's is today. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Randall, just quick question. It seems like zero rating is key part of the strategy here. Do you think that regulators are going to be okay with that strategy? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Regulators will be able to what, Tim? Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Zero rating, not charging for data usage of your own content. Will the regulators be okay with that do you think? That seems to be maybe the only real stumbling block on the transaction. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Tim, just I can't prejudge any of this. I just \u2013 I really don't know. We're just going to have to get into the process and put the data out for the regulators, and then begin that effort and the sausage will come out the way the sausage comes out, right? Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Good luck. Thanks guys. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess just a follow-up with that, if the FCC does decide to look at things like rate regulation for broadband, how does that impact your view on the deal and the optionality that it gives you? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Frank, the FCC has already started rate regulation reviews on broadband business, broadband services. And so look, that was always we felt the risk of Title II being implemented on top of this industry. I don't think it has any bearing, as you think about this deal. I mean, just rate regulation in general is just always the \u2013 I think is one of the great contributors to uncertainty in an industry like this when it's so capital intensive. So we're hopeful. The Chairman of the FCC as well as the President, when Title II was discussed, both said that they had no intention to regulate prices of broadband. And so hopefully that will be the case as we move forward with this transaction. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, I guess a follow-up. Looking at the opportunities you have here, how does this impact your network plans with 5G and so forth? Are there additional opportunities here that could accelerate some of those plans after you close the deal? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I would say you should anticipate \u2013 expect that to the extent that we can get the standards bodies moving and that we can get the vendor community moving that we would probably have a desire to move faster on 5G, certainly not slower. Our expectation is, as we begin to innovate with content, delivering content over these mobile networks, it's going to give us a lot more enthusiasm to go faster with 5G and not slower. And so we'll obviously do everything we can to try to accelerate all the efforts that are required to make this happen, but a lot of it is a logistical issue, standards bodies being set, getting equipment manufactured and so forth, but we're excited about it. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Frank, this is John. One thing I'd point out, with the diversification of the revenue stream and the reduction in the capital intensity that Time Warner brings to us, it brings us a lot more financial flexibility. And as we believe this ability to curate video to generate advertising, to be more efficient in production with all the data and insights we'll have, that should bring us profitability or revenue enhancements growth that will allow those decisions to fund the 5G on a very efficient basis while we continue to really manage the health of the balance sheet. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: It was a very elegant the way my CFO said yeah, he's preparing to invest. Randall, you better generate revenues. You just got to witness negotiation internally right here on the phone. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, that's very helpful and good luck with the hearings on the Hill. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks. I appreciate it, Frank. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on your core distribution business, with the decision to move into content on a larger scale, has anything changed with how you view the economics of your distribution business? And then secondly for John on synergies, maybe if you can, give us some more color on the timing of the synergy ramp post deal close. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So why don't I start off with the synergies? First I want to focus that these synergies are supply chain. They are vendor costs. They're corporate focused. We continue to expect the business units, specifically the three business units that we operate, and then really these are not personnel focused. I just want to make sure that's clear. When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've proven, as our leadership and our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining two companies' advertising, corporate communications, because they've been very successful with that. We learned that from DTV. If you look, quite frankly, at our telecom spend or Time Warner's telecom spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest quality services, and really from an investment base that we already have. That goes for both wireless and wireline. So that's a very direct one. If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very effectively at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner Networks, with the Warner Studios. We have a real opportunity to do that, and that's going to provide efficiency savings; and then frankly get into the things like what I call shared services, but efficiencies of payroll, efficiencies of accounts payable, efficiencies of cash management, all those kinds of things. So we've done very detailed analysis of these cost-focused synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that at the end of year three, we'll be on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation, and we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain, and then of course the corporate structure, but we feel very good about achieving that. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And on just the core distribution business and whether anything changed that spurred the push more aggressively into content? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: No, the only thing that changed was our conviction about the opportunity to bring into DIRECTV and the DIRECTV Now development our conviction that unique content could really, really provide a meaningful benefit to our customers and the ability to iterate and innovate on that on top of the OTT model. We're just regaining a lot of conviction that this is going to be a really significant opportunity for our customers. There is a huge customer base out there that we are convinced, while they don't subscribe to a bundle of premium content today at the right price point, over-the-top they will. And if you can bring a compelling price point and a compelling content package and some innovation with it, we are absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for large group of customers who really aren't even in the market today. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, thank you. Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Roxanne, we'll take one more question, okay? Operator : And that last question comes from the line of Mike McCormack, Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. David, maybe just a quick comment on the regulatory process. Could this be a DOJ-only process? And if so, how do you think they would look at it in the context of the Comcast-NBC deal? I guess one for Randall on just your view on the U.S. wireless market generally. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of diversification on AT&T's part. What do you think is the longer-term prognosis is in U.S. wireless given the competitive landscape? And I'll sneak one more in if I can on John Stephens just with respect to the handset adds. If it weren't for 2G losses this quarter, postpaid handsets would have been positive, I believe. As you step into 4Q, you'll see some more pressure. But looking into 2017, is there a return to handset growth at some point? David R. McAtee II - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, Mike. David here. I'll start. You basically asked how will the regulators look at this deal. I think it's a wise question. Let me focus on what I think is the most critical issue. The regulators will focus on what the market structure looks like today and then what the market structure looks like post-transaction. This is a very important point. Point number one is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today. And that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either. So that leads to the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to innovate in very important ways that benefit consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today. You're able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's length contract arrangement. And so by doing so what the regulators will be interested in, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction, and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see a positive story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive story as it comes to innovation. And then ultimately we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier, is this innovation spurs more innovation, and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G; that's Sprint. And so when you put all together, it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators. You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ-only process or whether the FCC would be involved. We know at this point, of course, that DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC would review those. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Mike, as it relates just the U.S. wireless market, I think it's important to constantly remember in this industry how we cycle through times. We say, wow, it really is mature and it's just getting hyper competitive. And I can't help but reflect on \u2013 I think it was 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T Wireless and we launched the Razr, the Motorola Razr. And I will never forget how many people would ask me, what are you going to do after everybody has a Razr? This industry is mature, right? And, lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband and smartphones come along. And smartphones take off and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years, literally. And while all this has been going on in the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum; fallow, waiting to be built into and deployed for video. Because now with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're not just Internet access devices, they are video consuming devices. And so we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively in ensuring that our customers can enjoy video. And now video and content that is uniquely curetted and developed for these kind of devices. And now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video, as we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1-gig type networks. Now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean, I am convicted. We are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next five years in a really significant way, depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors. They believe that the bandwidth requirement of an autonomous car is 1-gigabyte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth requirements; IoT, Internet of Things, healthcare. I just think one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone, that smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next and we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected car portfolio in the United States. We have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T. And so we just think there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, Randall. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hey, Mike, with regard to your last question, let me make one point first. On our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base because of that and that will alleviate next year, that's correct. Third, we're seeing tremendous development for us in the prepaid space with the Cricket brand and adding significant customers there, a space that's still relatively new to us. We've been in it about two new years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins. I'd say that has really improved the revenue growth, the profitability, and the customer accounts. And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; no billing, no credit checks, no subsidies, and the ARPUs that we're getting out of it is very good. So all that's happening and that's what's adding to these great margins, that's what's building these great margins. The one thing I would point to you though, that we're more excited about than just pure count is the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices that \u2013 so that while our \u2013 while our total net adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are trading up to much higher quality customer, who has much more functionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction, much higher quality, capability to watch video and utilize the content that Time Warner brings, we feel very good in that position. On a going forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly we should see some of the 2G \u2013 we will see the 2G pressures alleviate. But the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we've built, whether they'd be the connected cars, whether they'd be the Internet of Things, whether they'd be the various different capabilities we provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment, as well as the prepaid market, as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think this real opportunity is. Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we own it all, but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to \u2013 if you will ship those feature phones to smartphones, and if that opportunity to play into a prepaid space and value customer space that hadn't been our focus for \u2013 our lead focus for years now has become a very strong focus for us, and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us, both from a business and a consumer customer. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: So with that, we'll close. And I just \u2013 I want to reiterate. I think Jeff and I, we both have to say, we couldn't be more excited about what we're putting together here. We think this is really, really going to be a unique opportunity. We believe that premium content always wins. And we've said this that it always won in the theater, it now wins in the home, and it is now winning in the mobile device. People want to consume premium content and we have now partnered and are working to combine forces with, we believe, the top premium content developer, aggregator, and distributor in the world. And so we're really looking forward to putting these two companies together, defining the future of media and communications as they converge. We want to set the pace for this to happen. So thanks everybody for joining us and I appreciate your participation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today.

As always, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T website, and that includes our newly redesigned investor briefing which you\u2019ll want to take a look at. You can find them at att.com/investor.relations. I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page three, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available in AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of each Company's respective websites. We are also in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction, so we can't address any questions about spectrum today. And I will also turn your attention to page four, which is information regarding the SEC filings specifically the recently filed form S-4. Again that's on slide on four. And now, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John Stephens : Thanks, Mike, and hello everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. Before, I turn over to Randall for a strategic view of our Company, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operational results that are on slide five.  Our teams executed very well in 2016. We grew revenues and on adjusted basis, we expanded operating margins and increased earnings as we had projected. And free cash flow came in at the high end of expectations, even with strong capital investment. On top of that, we made significant progress with our integration of DIRECTV, meeting our cost synergy targets and launching our first over-the-top video service nationwide. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were down slightly due to fewer upgrade sales and some pressure on our legacy services. But customer gains and growth in video and IT-based services mostly offset these declines. At the same time, we continued to see adjusted consolidated margin expansion, even as we invested in customer growth opportunities in mobility, video and Mexico. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.66 or up nearly 5%. This includes adjustments for amortization, our annual mark-to-market pension plan adjustment, merger, integration related items and a one-time tax gain that was excluded. During the quarter we aligned our depreciation schedules with our updated business cases and engineering studies for certain of our network assets; this lowered depreciation expense on a sequential and year-over-year basis. This impact was offset by investments in strong wireless customer growth, in both U.S. and Mexico, and the development, launch and promotion of DIRECTV NOW. And while we expect those depreciation benefits to continue in 2017, they are expected to be offset by other non-cash items such as reductions in capitalized interest, benefit plan expense and taxes. Earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by revenue pressure in our legacy wireline services as a result of lack of fixed business investment as well as competition small business. Moving to cash flows, we had more than $39 billion in cash from operations for the full year. That\u2019s a record for us. This allowed us to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends, while also investing more in capital than we ever had before. Capital investment was 22.9 billion for the year that includes taking advantage of pricing and financing terms from our vendors that made good business sense for us, particularly with bonus depreciations still intact. Our investments are growth focused. For example, we're ahead of plan with our fiber to the home build. Today, we market nearly 4 million consumer customer locations. Free cash flow was strong, coming in at $3.7 billion for the quarter and nearly $17 billion for the year. That gives us a dividend payout ratio of 70% for the full year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.26 times. Let's now take a look at our operations where you see a consistent story of investment and the subscriber growth it generated. Those details are on slide six.  Let\u2019s start with wireless, which had a terrific quarter. As a reminder, the Company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. In a traditionally very busy quarter, we had strong subscriber growth, lower postpaid churn, and record margins. EBITDA service margin was the highest ever for both the full year and the quarter. And we also turned in record full year operating income margins. With did this even while investing in growth of our smartphone subscribers with offers such as unlimited wireless with video, and a buy one get one free BOGO offer. This helped grow our branded smartphone base by nearly 1.1 million, when you include customer upgrades. Churn was a solid story all year and didn\u2019t disappoint in the fourth quarter. Postpaid phone churn was a record fourth quarter low of 0.98% and overall postpaid churn improved year-over-year, in part due to increasing number of wireless and video bundles, and those numbers include churn pressure from our 2G network shutdown with strong sales even with the higher margins and 2G shutdown. We added 1.5 million total subscribers with more than a 0.5 million postpaid net adds. Branded phone subscribers also continued to grow. We added about 340,000 branded phones in the quarter. We did lose postpaid feature phones in the quarter. However, if you back out our forced turnover, caused by 2G network shutdown, our postpaid phone base was essentially flat. The 2G shutdown impacted net adds or about 22 basis points of pressure to our total churn. We see it most in our reseller and connected device numbers. But the team executed well and the network shutdown is now complete. It's a competitive market and a busy quarter, but our wireless team turned in another solid performance. It was also a big quarter for our entertainment group. The launch of DIRECTV NOW got most of the headlines. This robust over-the-top offering started strong, adding more than 200,000 paid subscribers in its first months. This gave us a solid video sub growth in the quarter. And we're pleased with the initial results from DIRECTV NOW, but we\u2019re going to be careful with our expectations. Customer promotions and launch pricing helped drive strong growth and still early. We're learning more about the subscriber base and the platform while we are working through the expected challenges that come with launching a new innovative service of this magnitude. Early sub demographics tend to be more urban, younger and apartment dwellers than a typical linear customer. Entertainment group revenues grew with games and video and IP services. Legacy services are less than 10% of total revenues, but still represent about a 250 basis-point drag on the group\u2019s growth rate. AdWorks continues to add scale as well. There was a $1.5 billion business in 2016 with revenues growing at double digit rates. Fourth quarter margins was down year-over-year because we didn\u2019t hesitate to invest in growth opportunities. That includes startup and launch costs for DTV NOW and increased promotional efforts to new and existing customers, across our entire product set. There were additional margin pressures as a customer rate increases were less than the content rate increases. This supports our thesis for acquiring Time Warner and strengthening our position in content. In broadband, overall subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter, while our fiber buildout continues to be a great story. Our penetration of broadband is a full 9 percentage points higher in those markets compared with our non-fiber footprint. After we launch our 100% fiber network in the new market, we're seeing about half of the new broadband customers buying speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher with 30% of the customers taking a gig. And the real kicker is that the vast majority of recent sales in those markets are taking multiple services from us. So, as our fiber deployment accelerates, we\u2019re excited about this growth opportunity. Now, let's look at business solutions on slide seven. Our business segment continues to perform well even as it feels the impact of a lagging economy and the lack of business fixed investment. Wireless growth was solid but not enough to overcome the pressures of legacy services decline. The drop off in business wireline spending was felt in all our business segments. Enterprise is maintaining a leading share position in the tough environment but comparisons were impacted by the second quarter 2016 sale of some of our hosting operations. Small business is seeing the impact of competition. Strategic business services\u2019 growth helped offset some of the decline in business solutions; it was up $230 million or 8.3% year-over-year. These services now represent 38% of wireline revenues and an annualized revenue stream of around $12 billion. Margins expanded as EBITDA grew by more than $50 million, as efficient cost management helped to offset the impact of a slow economy. We\u2019re also seeing continued progress on our network virtualization and our software defined network enabled services. Our virtualization plan is ahead of schedule with 34% of our network virtualized at the end of the year and net NetBond continues to well-received with 19 of the leading cloud service providers now making it available. Moving to our international operations, Mexico continues to be an investment story, while our DIRECTV Latin America operations continues to manage profitability in a very difficult environment. Mexico has been a remarkable success story. In a little more than a year, we deployed 4G LTE, 78 million people in more than a 160 markets; rebranded our services and stores; and became the fastest growing wireless company in the country. Customer growth is strong. We added 1.3 million new wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter and over 3 million customers for the full year. This strong investment obviously pressures margins but as you can see in several parts of our business, we\u2019re clearly willing to invest in growth. In our Latin America video business, revenues grew and operating income increased and the business continued to generate positive free cash flow, despite the challenged environment. Let\u2019s now review our full year results, see how they stack up with the guidance we gave you last January. That\u2019s on slide 8. Our teams did a good job of hitting the targets we set out a year ago. Revenue growth hit our double-digit growth projection, thanks to our DTV acquisition and gains in IP services video. Adjusted earnings came in the middle of our mid single-digit EPS growth target. Adjusted operating margins actually expanded by 60 basis points as efficiencies and cost cutting overcame investment pressure in Mexico and other growth-related expenses. Capital investment was at the high end of what we expected. We took advantage of vendor offers and bonus depreciation when it made business sense. Free cash flow came in at the high end of expectations, and we accomplished this even after making $750 million in payments to our pension and benefit plans this year. This includes $350 million in payments into our pension plan, as part of our agreement with the Department of Labor from our prior mobility funding. These payments now fulfill our obligation under that agreement a full year ahead of schedule. We have also voluntarily made another $400 million deposit to our employee medical fund. These payments make our benefit plans even stronger; in fact, we do not expect any funding this coming year. This strong cash generation allowed us to easily hit our annual dividend payout ratio in the 70s. And if you adjust for the voluntary pension and benefit payment, that percentage gets to the high 60s. We also did a nice job of hitting our operational targets. Already mentioned hitting our virtualization goal on our fiber build, we also made significant progress with our 5G trials including a millimeter wave underway in Austin. And our network team accomplished all of this while they had expenses that were down year-over-year. When you look at everything we are doing with the combination of spectrum, fiber, software and new technologies, you can see why we are confident in our ability to lead in connectivity. Now, let's take a look at our outlook for 2017 on slide nine. Our business always has had a lot of moving pieces, but with the new administration taking office, there is even more to think about this year. It's just too early to call the impact of several issues. Tax reform has been a hot button and it makes sense for the company our size with the taxes we pay, would clearly have an opportunity to benefit from the change in tax rate. We're also staring at the potentially better regulatory environment. Positive change in both of these areas would help us deliver faster on plans to innovate and grow our business. Some are speculating that the economy might grow faster, and there will be an uptick in business fixed investment. That would definitely be good for us. And we are waiting to hear for the final outcome of the first of that process. You know that we are an approved bidder and we are optimistic about our opportunity, but we don\u2019t know the answer to that yet. We're also in the process of closing our Time Warner transaction. We remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. These are all potentially very good things for AT&T, but these items are not included in our 2017 guidance. Our outlook is based on what we know today, and here is what you can expect from us in 2017. First, we see revenue growth in the low single digits. Growth in IP services and video is expected to offset competitive pressures, soft business investment and declines in legacy services. We expect adjusted earnings growth to continue in the mid single-digit range. We also expect continued consolidated operating margin expansion. CapEx is expected in the $22 billion range, similar to last year. And we expect to see continued free cash flow growth with free cash flow in the $18 billion range and continuing our drive towards $20 billion. And we\u2019ll continue to move forward on all the operational initiatives that we have underway with our network. We\u2019ll sharpen our outlook as the year unfolds, that\u2019s a broad view of what to expect from us in 2017. With that, I'll turn it over to, Randall for a strategic business update. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, John, appreciated. We have a new President and FCC Chairman, Bill. So, I know everybody is talking about tax and the regulatory reform, and you're going to have a lot of questions for us about that. But before we get to your questions, I do just want to take a brief moment and offer some perspective on how AT&T is now positioned in converging telecom media and technology space. We\u2019ve spent the last few years in a very heavy investment cycle, it\u2019s no secret. We\u2019ve been getting ready for a world where mobile technology and premium video content would intersect. And we've been convinced for a long time that this intersection was inevitable. And when it happened, we wanted to have the foundation laid to make the intersection a very different experience for our customers. And that foundation in our mind begins with a network that\u2019s engineered and designed for the special requirements of video. It has to have deep capacity, it has to have broad distribution. And if you would look at slide 11, you can see that this is exactly the foundation we built. Our high-speed network is engineered and it\u2019s built for video. It's an LTE network that covers nearly 400 million people in the U.S. and Mexico; there is nobody else that\u2019s even close. We're building out fiber to 12.5 million locations. This network is software defined, and that gives us unique scalability at the lowest cost per megabyte around. It's a network with an elegant path to gigabit speeds and 5G. And in terms of capacity, we're really in the unique position here. We've been invested $27 billion in spectrum over the past five years. And as a result, we have the premier spectrum position in the industry, 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum. And as John referenced, if we're successful with our first net bid, we get access to another 20 megahertz of prime nationwide spectrum for public safety and secondary use. And as you also heard John say early, our 2G network has now been shut down. And that spectrum is being reformed for future use as well. And then, if you look at our points of distribution, they are second to none. 147 million mobile customers across North America, that includes a leading IoT business; we have 46 million pay TV subscribers in the U.S. and Latin America; 16 million broadband subscribers and we have an OTT platform DIRECTV NOW that's off to a really fast start. So that\u2019s our foundation and it's an indication of what\u2019s to come. We think this is a very strong foundation. And so, given that, it seems only logical for us to assume an ownership position in the critical application that's going to ride on this foundation, and that\u2019s premium entertainment content, and that\u2019s exactly what we're doing with the acquisition of Time Warner. And if you look at slide 12, our technology and distribution we think are a perfect fit for the best premium content creator and distributor on the planet. In the telecom, media and technology space, we're building a global leader. And we\u2019ve been pursuing a strategy to become the premier integrated communications company in the world and DIRECTTV really catalyzed that strategy, and you saw us execute on that last year with our new TV Everywhere application and data free TV and DIRECTV NOW. And that integrated experience helped drive our best ever fourth quarter churn for our U.S. postpaid mobility business. Now, bringing Warner Brothers, HBO and all the Turner networks under the AT&T umbrella is going to allow us to expand the strategy beyond just simple connectivity to deep integration of premium content for our customers. As we look ahead, the strategy is expanded to create the best entertainment and communications experiences in the world, and I am very convinced this foundation has been laid for us to deliver exactly that. And so, with that, what I want to do is turn over to Mike and be glad to take your questions on the quarter or anything you else you would like to talk about. So, Mike? Michael Viola : Okay. Cathy, we are ready to take the Q&As. And so, why don\u2019t you queue up the first question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Randall, you brought up two important topics in your prepared remarks, the tax reform and regulatory changes that we are seeing in Washington. Maybe first, from a tax reform standpoint, what's your view on how this unfolds and what it could mean, maybe especially related to guidance for AT&T in 2017 and beyond? And then, obviously, new leadership with the FCC with Ajit Pai, just initial views on what that can mean for telecom regulation in the U.S.? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thank you, John. I had the opportunity to meet with what was then the President-elect couple of weeks ago, and I got to say I was impressed. I was meeting with the CEO, it was obvious. And the President had a very specific agenda in terms of what he thought was critical, and that was tax reform and regulatory reform, and we spoke at length about each of those. And I would tell you that the man, the President is focused on these. And so, laughed with a degree of optimism that this could actually be pulled off this year. Now, what does that look like? We've seen the President's proposal; we've seen Paul Ryan's proposal, both of them I think trigger the impact that I have been talking about for quite some time. And that is, if we want to get off this 1% to 2% growth plane, there is nothing that will trigger that like tax reform. I mean, everybody knows the numbers. We have the most uncompetitive tax structure in United States, it\u2019s the highest tax rate in the developed world in the United States. And to bring that into competitive levels, and you pick your number what tax rate you think that is, will have a stimulative effect, we\u2019re convinced. In fact, we know at AT&T, if you saw tax rates move to 20% to 25%, we know what we would do; we would step up our investment levels and there are things we would like to accelerate, if we had a more favorable tax environment. So, John, my guess in terms of where this lands is probably no better than yours. But, I do think a lower corporate tax rate is likely, I think it's more than possible, I think it's likely. I think there will be some things that will be done to help pay for that. And there is discussion about what there would be denial of deductibility of interest cost, for example, but they are also talking about immediate expensing of capital. So, you have to factor a timing issue or the permanent issue. And then, obviously what nobody really has a good handle on is what happens in the way of trade, border adjustment tax and so forth, and how that plays into this. So, it's really up in the air in terms of what this will look like. But, I would tell you, I'm optimistic something would happen. And as John pointed out, none of that has been factored into our numbers and the guidance that we have given you. If tax reform does happen this year, the biggest payoff to AT&T, more than just the tax rates is what happens on the business side. I mean, an extra 1% growth in GDP over the next couple of years is rather significant for AT&T. And if a tax rate cut caused all businesses to think about investment the way AT&T is thinking about it, and all businesses begin to invest, that has nothing but a stimulative effect to our customer base. We have a very large enterprise business customer base. So, we think this is nothing but positive. In fact, I told some people last week in Europe that back in July, we had a Board meeting, and after we concluded our long range plan, the Board asked us to lay out for them what a recessionary environment in 2017 would look like. Fast forward to December, the Board wanted to talk about, what an upside scenario in the economy would look like. And nothing happened between those two, except an election and a President who is talking about corporate tax reform. So, I think this is very significant and very, very important. In terms of regulatory, in terms of what to expect, all I can base my thoughts on, John, are Ajit Pai\u2019s writings and his comments. And he obviously was not a fan of the Title II regulation that was imposed on the industry. He felt like it had gone entirely too far; we obviously tend to agree with him on that. We happen to be advocates of net neutrality, just the concept of neutrality but placing utility style regulation on our mobility and internet businesses. There is no way anybody can argue that that is not suppressive to investment. And so, we\u2019re hopeful that Chairman Pai will come in and begin to address some of these issues that are suppressing capital investment. We're also optimistic that he would begin to rationalize some of the regulatory oversight, areas where -- like on privacy. We have two layers of regulation on privacy in this industry, in a world we\u2019re moving into media and entertainment and content. The ability to have predictability and understand who oversees the privacy rules and who sets those rules, and so bringing some clarity to that, it just will be very, very helpful to clear the underbrush of regulation, bring clarity and some level of predictability to the regulatory environment. So, we're optimistic in terms of what Chairman Pai would bring to the industry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Go ahead, please. Phil Cusick : Can you talk for me about the success of foreign cross selling, broadband and wireless into DIRECTV homes? We haven\u2019t really seen the pick up yet of broadband, the way we would expect it with DIRECTV coming in? And how's that been going into wireless as you discount across those businesses; has it been more existing customers that are tying things together or are you really starting to see a cross-selling effect? Thanks, Randall. Randall Stephenson : I\u2019ll tee it up, and then John, I'll let you follow up my comments. But, as we told you, coming into the year, it was going to take time to get the cross-selling, just the plumbing and the mechanics in place to be aggressive on cross-selling. And we are at a place now where the last three quarters we have seen multi product sales just continue to escalate. And they are little bit behind our plan, but I would tell you, the last two quarters are starting to catch up to plan. So, cross-selling on each sale is really getting to levels that we\u2019re feeling more and more comfortable with and better about. So, I think it's really good. Early on, you hit the nail on the head; it has been our existing customers that are attaching the services to each other. And so DIRECTV customers, who are attaching unlimited wireless with their DIRECTV bundles, but we are seeing some migration of wireless through the DIRECTV product sets s well. And I think the best place is this is manifesting itself, Phil. We were probably not the most promotional in the industry in the fourth quarter. And we set a record low churn rate in the fourth quarter. And it's getting to a point where we are beginning to be able to attach causing effect to a lot of the integrated solutions and the integrated offerings including unlimited data, data free TV and so forth. So, we\u2019re early in the game, the plumbing is now getting put in place and the billing is getting refined; we\u2019re still not completely there on the plumbing, and we\u2019re investing a lot of money to make that happen. But early indications, we\u2019re feeling pretty good, are starting to take hold. John Stephens : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add, Phil, is if you look at the churn characteristics and then really strong performance on the mobility side, we attribute some of that to this video bundle with the wireless property. We have about 8 million customers now on that unlimited video bundle, and we believe that that's providing real cross, if you will, product improvement. Finally, if we look at where we are going with the fiber to the prem on the 4 million homes we are selling into, the vast majority of those high-speed broadband sales are taking multiple products with us. So, that continues to go well, taking not only the broadband but the video and also the wireless. So, that continues to go well. And then lastly, the attach rates that we are having through both, the video and the -- excuse me, the broadband and the video product continue to improve throughout the year. And so, the efforts that Randall talked about and training -- getting the plumbing right and training the call center people and training the tax and so forth is paying off. We remain optimistic about it; we\u2019re going to be cautious and make sure that we prove it out, but it is going well. And as I say, the strongest point might be the $8 million customers who quickly bundled their video and their wireless offering, and you see it quietly frankly in the churn results we have. It's really very good. Phil Cusick : If I can follow up, how did the sales of paying DIRECTV NOW customers lineup to either your wireless or fixed businesses? John Stephens : I think what we will you is that we are still going through all that details and you got to remember the DIRECTV NOW customer sales are much different with regard to the necessity. When you are paying with the credit card online, the information you have with regard to physical location and so forth is different. But, what we are finding is, as we mentioned, they are more urban, they are younger and they are apartment dwellers. And so, they are giving us an opportunity, we believe, to penetrate a market wireless and other products where we don\u2019t -- where we are not as effective as we are in some of the other markets. So, we think it's real opportunity. So far, it is lining up I think as expected in that urban, that multi-dwelling unit, that young marketplace and then a marketplace that, if you will, we have an opportunity to grow share to get to some of the same levels as we have of share in some of the more established markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden : I guess, if I could too, the first one for you, Randall, just in terms of Pai\u2019s is pretty clearly stated positions on the open internet order and price regulation, and even things like zero rating. Could you kind of map out a game plan that AT&T would have for taking advantage of that? And what kind of appetite do you see in Silicon Valley in the content community for trying to take advantage of some of the zero rating offerings that AT&T has? And then, second, if I could for you John, on the guide, if you could, maybe unpack the revenue growth outlook a little bit as to what the biggest moving parts are. And if I annualize the depreciation benefit you got quarter-over-quarter, it looks like there is about 1.8 billion of lower depreciation incrementally in 2017 that would otherwise help earnings. I think you said it was going to go away to other non-cash items. If you could kind of lay out what those are would be great. Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Hi, David. As it relates to our plans, on zero rating under a Pai chairmanship, I\u2019d say that you shouldn't expect that they will change. We were going hard, and we had worked very diligently to put in place a mechanism that makes this capability available to all comers. Anybody who wants to take advantage of zero rating, they can come in and take advantage of the lowest wholesale rate we offer, and they could do the exact same thing. So, we put this in place in a very thoughtful fashion, in a fashion that is consistent with many, many years, in fact decades of precedent in terms of how we implement something like this. And so, we actually were quite confident that zero rating, as we were implementing it, was fine under a Pai chairmanship or anybody else\u2019s chairmanship. Now, the FCC obviously issued a letter the last week of the prior Chairman\u2019s tenure, and the letter was critical of it. But we think the letter is without basis, any legal basis. And so, you should expect to see us go hard. We're having some really good success in the marketplace with this. This is a value proposition that our customers area loving. 200,000 DIRECTV NOW subscribers are on it; they are taking advantage of it; it is a very elegant experience if you\u2019re a customer that you\u2019re watching AT&T content and it's not counting against your data bucket. So, that\u2019s a big deal and it's proving to be very advantageous in the marketplace for our customers. So, you should expect to see us continue that and continue to push aggressively on this. I'll tell you, if you wanted a prospective on 200,000 subscribers and how attractive this was in the marketplace at $35 price point, we launched U-verse back in 2007. It took us a year and a half to get to 200,000 subscribers on U-verse. So that\u2019s the elegance of this platform and the attractiveness of it to our customers. So, we're pretty excited about it. John Stephens : David, with regard to the kind of giving a little some additional insight into the guidance, I'll go about it this way. On the mobility side, we've seen the penetration of mobile share value plans, unlimited plans and these bundled plans increase dramatically over the last three years. So, we\u2019re substantially through that migration. And we believe that with that, we have this opportunity to not only retain customers and continue to show good subscriber mechanisms results, but also have an opportunity on the revenue side to prove that out. We're not giving specific guidance on individual items. Secondly, with regard to the handset business, we did see a year-over-year slowdown in handset upgrades, even in the fourth quarter, even with the launch of a new device, an iconic new device. So, we are learning about what the customers want. We've given them their choice; they shown up with more BYOD; they chosen to hold their devices longer and pay off their equipment installment plans in full. And that's all been good for us; it's been good for our retention, for our customer accounts, for our churn, but quite frankly it will impact depending upon how popular sales are, how many upgrades we have, the revenues going forward from the equipment sales. I'll point out, this year, we had gross adds that grew year-over-year, we had upgrades that were down significantly year-over-year. And so, we are sharing in the new competitive market, but our customers that are staying with us, because of low churn are choosing to hold devices or bring their own devices to us. On the business side, continue to have good penetration, good success with wireless, Internet of Things, connected devices all the capabilities there. And our outlook is still optimistic about that. The challenges with regard to the traditional legacy business revolves around the economy. We continue to see good success in strategic services, once again the best answer for that might be tax reform from a perspective of as Randall mentioned, if people think similarly to us and take those savings and invest and build their businesses, it will be the best way for us to grow our top line, which will be really good for our customers, good for our shareholders, quite frankly good for jobs, so that that\u2019s aspect of it. On the entertainment side, we're seeing good growth in the speeds that customers are taking on broadband and good response with the ARPUs associated with that. So, we remain optimistic and we\u2019re significantly almost completely through the migration to higher speeds that will continue on but we are on the IP broadband platforms. If you look at the video business, we\u2019ll continue to see that video business grow and continue to see -- will learn about what happens with regard to our over-the-top product. And lastly, we have the challenges there of the legacy services that we\u2019ll continue to work hard to retain and to migrate into other services but that's the challenge. That's how we unbundle it, that's how we look at it. The last piece I\u2019ll tell you is Mexico or international, Mexico continues to be a tremendous story of customer growth, which should give us the opportunity for revenue increases. The challenges there are quite frankly foreign exchange and what happens with the peso, so that we will see constant currency revenue, growth; we\u2019re confident of that. The challenge will be what happens with foreign exchange rates, and we haven\u2019t assumed any improvement in our base case. And then DIRECTV in Latin America is just continuing to perform really well from a management perspective in what continues to be a difficult tough economy. With regard to the depreciation initiative, let me pose it this way. I'm not sure where the number came from with regard to the 1.8, I\u2019d suggest you this. The depreciation benefit year-over-year, we\u2019re right around $400 million down, on a sequential basis this year -- and that's in this year's numbers, so that in and of itself goes to the comparison next year. But secondly, with regard to that depreciation, there is also other non-cash items, things like capitalization of interest with regard to spectrum, and as you know, we're putting more and more spectrum to use; changes at our benefit plans and benefit expense, those things will continue to impact it; amortization of customer installation costs; quite frankly income tax rules, all of those matters go to offset the depreciation. I would suggest you say we\u2019re near the number you quoted, but the depreciation aspect of year-over-year. What I'll really point you out to though is really the asset test for me and is the fact that we're going to -- we've given guidance that we will have free cash flow in the $18 billion range. And you can do the math on that, that free cash flow is consistent if not higher than our guidance with regard to earnings. So, we feel really good about our earnings and particularly feel really good about our cash flows going forward. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Randall, maybe just a quick comment on the overall competitive landscape in wireless. We saw a lot of different happenings this year, and you guys are obviously doing some bundling, T-Mobile getting aggressive, at least initially that free iPhone deal back in September. Just getting a sense for how would you characterize the industry and how do you think that changes as we look into 2017? And then, maybe just one for John on the economics, as you think about U-verse subscribers moving off the U-verse platform onto DIRECTV proper, what's the sort of economic trade off there? Randall Stephenson : Hi, Mike. Competitive landscape, it\u2019s really competitive. And in terms of what we think it looks like this coming year, we think it's really competitive this coming year. And it was -- fourth quarter was just a very promotional quarter. All the competitors got very, very promotional, and free devices and buy one get one free type stuff. We were probably less promotional than most and doing that while maintaining what was for us a record low churn rate, we felt really good about. Our intention, as we move forward, is the same as it was the last quarter, and that is we're going to compete with differentiated solutions. And this integrated solutions for us is really, really important. And as we pointed out and as Phil was probing on, we\u2019re starting to get real traction in the marketplace of integrating our products and solutions, and our churn rate goes down so precipitously, when we get more than one product bundled together and particularly, as we begin to do some creative things like DIRECTTV NOW and the TV Everywhere app on DIRECTTV is proving to be incredibly powerful. This thing -- the last numbers I looked at, John Stephens, you can you correct me if you have more recent information. But the volumes were growing like 40% month over month sequentially, and that\u2019s the amount of consumption that people are using on their iPads and their smartphones and streaming video from DIRECTV on their devices. And that\u2019s why the free data TV is so important, and is such an important variable for our customers. And so that is how you should expect we will compete again in 2017, we're getting better and better at putting these packages together for our customers, and the customer adoption rates continue to go up. So, I think the next year is going continue to be very promotional; it's going to be probably, time will tell what happens on pricing, but I think you should expect the promotional activity to continue, we will compete with bundling and integrated solutions. John Stephens : Mike, on the U-verse versus the DTV platform, I think it\u2019s pretty straight forward. One is we still have some content cost differentiation and some package capabilities that are important, and we can achieve those. Frankly, it frees up the data capacity on the wired network, allows us to then provide broadband speeds that are quicker and quite frankly alleviate some of the CapEx in the back office, so to speak, or back into the network, and that's a positive thing. Third, it eventually lead us to the ability to use one graphic user interface support cost, on product support cost and one standard, if you will, face to the customer and those are all important. The other opportunity though is does give us the opportunity to go to the customer and visit with the customer and make sure we maximize all the products and services we can sell to them including not only the broadband, not only the video, but wireless and others. So, that's how we think about it. We certainly are committed to continuing to provide a quality video product in either case and we are continuing now to, if you will, provide an over-the-top that allows us to do it whether we utilize either a wired or a satellite network. So, we're trying to cover all bases to look at all opportunities. Randall Stephenson : Mike, I don\u2019t want to bounce around on you but I want to follow up though on the competitive environment because all I spoke of was the consumer side of the market. I want to make sure that we didn\u2019t leave out. The lion share of our wireless business is business side, and we are continuing to grow their very nicely, our wireless business to business customers. And that again, like the consumer side, but we\u2019re much further down the path on integrated solutions in wireless. Because if you think about where this has gone and where we are having our greatest success is our customers, getting them from the mobile device on a secured network VPN connection into the cloud using NetBond and back out without ever touching to public internet. This is proving to be very powerful capability for our business customers. And then, we are having incredible success brining IoT solutions to bear along with this. And we think we\u2019re leading the industry in the Internet of Things capabilities that are integrated in are VPN and in our mobile business together, it's proving to be a really powerful combination for our customers as well. And so, bottom line, the growth of wireless from our B2B side of the house or business customers is continuing to be fairly robust, and it's a terrific business. And that is kind of the big proof point on if you could truly bring integrated solutions to bear, the significance it has in the market, and you compete in the different level, not just on promotions and price. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : I was wondering if we could touch back on your guidance for 2017, and your guidance calls for adjusted operating margin expansion. How should we think about the trajectory of your wireless business within this context, against a backdrop of what you mentioned will likely be a continued healthy pricing environment for wireless? And then, in terms of your guidance for free cash flow, you are pointing to $18 billion in 2017. Previously, you had suggested that cash flow could reach about $20 billion by 2020 plus. Based on this current trajectory, it seems that that target could be pulled forward excluding Time Warner as well as any tax legislation changes. Is that a fair assumption? And what are the operational puts and takes that could get you there? John Stephens : Let me take a shot at this. First off, first regarding the margins, as you might expect, we are not going to give individual guidance on margins but I would point out something that I think is straight forward. And that is we have gotten 78 million 4G LTE POPs built in Mexico; we've got a 160 plus markets that we've got distribution, brand, knowledge, sales opportunities, and if you will, effective markets, and we've grow the base of customers to 12 million. So, we expect improvements in Latin America. You guys can see the numbers are clearly just in Mexico particularly, you can see they\u2019re clearly displayed with what we did in Mexico. So that will in and of itself, give us a tailwind to improving margins. That\u2019s the first point. Second point, we clearly have momentum in our wireless business on improving margins. The team has shown that every quarter this year going back to last year. Challenges there are the point when we decide to, as they did in some cases in the fourth quarter, decided invest in growth, and we will continue to do that on a very diligent, thoughtful manner. It was very effective in the fourth quarter, the team still came with great record margins. But I don\u2019t want to specific statement guidance on margins, because we want to make sure the business units have those tools at their disposal, when they are performing at this level, to invest in growth and get good customer. So to summarize and really if you look first at the opportunities to get there, it\u2019s everything the network operation is doing, the fact that year-over-year our, if you will, back office, our network, our ATNO [ph] costs are down. If you see the heavy lifting work, if you see what's going on in the sales teams and the business unit operations and their tremendous performance on management expense, those all give us momentum. You see what's happening in Mexico in a sense that we have now built that platform out significantly and are ready to start operationalize it; that will give you that confidence. I feel really good about that opportunity. Randall Stephenson : Amir, to John's comment, he\u2019s made it twice, and it bears pairs repeating and maybe emphasizing, and that is there is a lot going on inside this business right now. And by virtue of software defined networking implementation and a lot of the automation that is going on in our network and IT organizations, that big cost structure, the network, the big iron network and all of our IT costs. Year-over-year, they are actually down, and not in consequently, they\u2019re down. This cost curve is actually on the run. And I've never seen this in my -- I\u2019ve been doing this 35 year and I have never seen anything like this. In 2017, we're forecasting the exact same thing and feeling really good about our ability to execute on keeping that cost curve moving down is providing a lot of support in a world of aggressive pricing and so forth to allow us to be competitive in the marketplace. So, that\u2019s a really important variable to take note of. John Stephens : Amir, with regard to your comments, we are guiding to $18 billion in free cash flow, we feel good about that, it comes from all the activities that the entire team has pushed forward this year, really sharp cash flow management, everything from our supply chain, our working capital up and down, our management teams, our sales guys help us with it, everybody up and down the line, the network -- construction guys, managing their inventories, managing everything in the flow, all of that. So, we feel good, feel confident about getting to that $18 billion level. We're not going to guide past next year, but yes, that march or that drive or that progress towards $20 billion is really occurring, and we feel good about the progress we're making. I don\u2019t know that -- I don\u2019t believe we've given any target of a year to get to any specific level outside of next year. But with that being said, we're expecting the $18 billion range next year and we feel really good about the cash generation opportunities of this business. What Randall just said is just an easy way to give that credibility when the hard costs of this business are going down year-over-year, when the management team is performing at their level, you get momentum, when you get momentum when software network function virtualization up to 34% and have a track now to 75%. And when you see those kinds of things happening, it gives us confidence that we can continue to grow the cash of this business, which is really an underlying support for the overall profitability; it's really the proof of the overall profitability of our business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Simon Flannery : John, I know we've talked a lot about taxes already, but could you just give us a sense of what your cash tax rate is likely to be relative to your book tax rate this year, assuming no changes? And then, Randall, we talked about the economy a couple of times, but you usually give a broader view of what you are hearing from CIOs and CEOs and others in terms of the environment. I thought there were a couple of comments in the business solutions about some pressure in some of the legacy products. Is there any change there or is that sort of business as usual? John Stephens : So, I'll take a stab with the cash tax question. I'll say it this way, we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance on cash taxes. It's clearly included in our overall cash guidance. What I'll suggest you that the depreciation rules, the bonus depreciation rules, we see a lot of benefit to companies that invest in Latin America as we do, but still in place. And there is no significant large changes in our assumptions. And so, I can't point to anything that I would imply would significantly change -- that I could point for an easy significant change in the year-over-year basis. Specifically, we're talking about a $22 billion CapEx range, which is similar to what we spent last year. And as I think we on an every year basis are very, very diligent about managing our cash from the tax side and there is no reason to expect that to change. With that I'll leave it at that and hand it off to Randall. Randall Stephenson : On the economy, Simon, we have assumed for 2017 a steady as she goes economic growth rate or GDP growth rate, it's actually a sub 2 is what we have built into our plan, what's built into these numbers that you are looking at here. I would tell you my sentiment I don\u2019t think is unique among the CEO community, and that is that I am optimistic as I look forward, and I'm optimistic that if we get line of sight to real meaningful tax reform, if we get line of sight to -- and it won\u2019t be when it passes, when we get line of sight, we will begin to think differently about areas we are investing in. I don\u2019t think I'm unique in that regard. Conversations I'm having with CEOs, as we get line of sight to this, I think you are going to see people begin to open up the first look and begin to invest at a higher level. And so, once that happens that is -- there is no driver to economic growth like investment. I happen to be a supply side guy, I think the math and the science is with me on that. And as investments ticks up, economic activity ticks up, hiring ticks up; as hiring ticks up, spending ticks up. And so, I'm actually of a mindset that if we get a tax reform, we could exit this year doing something better than what is in this plan. And so, call me optimistic. And if we get tax reform, I do think that there is upside to these economic forecasts. And if we get tax reform, I would suggest that maybe upside to these guidance that we are giving you but it\u2019s wait and see. And I'll also say that it's not an inconsequential attitude, if you will, among the CEO community about the potential in terms of what can happen with regulation. And nobody thinks that regulations should go away. We all believe that the customers still needs protection and safety and all that is so critical. But we've had a regulation that has been just unpredictable; it\u2019s interfering with how you think about designing products; it\u2019s interfering with how you think about entering new markets. And if you really begin to get confident, the regulatory burden is rationalize somewhat, that in and of itself is going to free up investment. And so, I think as you know, GDP and economic growth is much a function of attitude and confidence as anything else. And I would tell you, a lot of people are feeling confident that there is going to be meaningful tax reform that\u2019s going to have its effect, but too early to tell right now. We're kind of -- our guidance is premised on a steady as she goes, but I think there is some potential for upside on the economy, if we get tax reform. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : I am actually just going to follow up on that because Randall, you said you would see the opportunity to invest more, if there was tax reform. And it sounds like part of that is simply supporting your customers who would probably have more investment needs and more growth. But are there certain business cases that you guys have been looking at where if there is tax reform, all of a sudden the math changes a lot and I'll just make something up, for example, instead of stopping at 12.5 million fiber homes, you would go much beyond that. I am just trying to think about opportunities that are unique to your business where you might accelerate capital if the reforms go the way you hope they would. Randall Stephenson : So, I can -- you touched on one, would we go beyond 12.5, I don\u2019t know, but would we accelerate the 12.5, I think we try to look at whether we could bring some of those forward. We're in the process of deploying 40 megahertz of spectrum, are there some things we would do forward some of the wireless build and bring our speeds, our mobile speeds up considerably. And let's assume, and by the way this is unknown, but we were to win the first net bid, we want to go faster on the deployment of first debt with tax reform. I mean there is just a long list of things that the business cases really good, or you could accelerate some of your build requirements and accelerate the business cases on many of these. John Stephens : And Brett, I\u2019d offer -- this is exactly what happened this year with our fiber to the prem build. The team hit this year's goal and hit this year's CapEx budget, so to speak, prior to year-end, and they came back and said we can keep going and we can get more done efficiently and effectively but you\u2019ve got to give us some more money. And we did just that with bonus depreciation in place this year, it gave us that opportunity to justify the business case and move it ahead. That\u2019s one of the variances, if you will, in our CapEx spending, but it's exactly the situation you're talking about. Randall Stephenson : With that, I believe that will be the last question. And I appreciate everybody participating in this. I've got to tell you, we're feeling really good about what we have built here. And as we look forward to bringing Time Warner into the fold and doing some very unique things with media and entertainment and content in this foundation of networks, we're feeling really, really positive and excited about bringing that together. So, thank you for your attention, and we will talk to you next time. Thank you very much. Michael Viola : Thanks everybody and on your way home tonight, please remember no text is worth a life. It can wait. Thanks and take care. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today.

LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter conference call. Good to have everybody with us today. Joining me on the call is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to cover our operational results first. Randall's going to follow that with an overall business strategy update, and then we'll get to the Q&A session. As always, our earnings material are available on our Investor Relations page. You can find that on att.com/investor.relations. I need to call your attention to two Safe Harbor statements before we begin. That's on slide 3 and slide 4. They say that some of these comments today may be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on AT&T's and Straight Path's SEC filing and on the Investor Relations page of each company's respective websites. And, finally, we still remain in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction. And so with that I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of you for being on the call. Before I turn it over to Randall, I'd like to provide you a brief overview of our first quarter results. We opened the year on a very competitive note. The wireless market moved to unlimited, several over-the-top video players launched new services, and a major cable company announced plans to offer wireless service in an effort to duplicate the integrated experience we offer today. All this reinforced our belief that we are the best prepared for the new world, where capacity, networks, and entertainment intersect. A year from now, we may look back on the return to unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and capacity began. In a world of unlimited plans and growing mobile video usage, you need a network and the capacity to handle the load and meet customer expectations for quality service. We have just that, and Randall will talk more about that in just a few minutes, but let's first look at the results for the quarter. Consolidated revenues were pressured by record low postpaid upgrade rates in wireless and pressure in legacy wireline from grooming, but at the same time, we continue to operate efficiently and drive costs out of the business. Adjusted consolidated margins were up 80 basis points year over year to 20.7%. Credit for this goes to our entire management team but especially to our technology and network ops group and their work on automation, digitization, and network virtualization. We're well on our way to virtualizing 55% of the network functions by the end of the year, and we are seeing the cost and capital savings from those efforts. We grew adjusted earnings. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.74, up about 3%. That includes about $0.02 of pressure from storm damage on the West Coast and legal settlements. Also during the quarter, we wrote down the book value of our legacy publishing investment. That was partially offset by gains from a spectrum swap with Verizon. Both of those items were adjusted for EPS purposes. Cash flows continue to be strong. Cash from operations reached $9.2 billion. Free cash flow was $3.2 billion, the same as last year, even though we increased capital spending to $6 billion for the quarter. We had improved working capital and lower tax payments in the first quarter and chose to reinvest those efforts in the business. While this made first quarter capital spending levels higher year over year, our CapEx guidance remains unchanged. This also was a key strategic quarter for AT&T. We made several significant moves that put us in a strong spectrum position for the future. We signed an agreement to acquire FiberTower, a holder of 39 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum, and we were awarded the FirstNet contract to build and operate a national first responders network. And earlier this month we announced our intention to acquire Straight Path. We have now been informed by Straight Path that their board has received a superior proposal. Under our existing contract with Straight Path, we have the right to negotiate with the company over the next five business days to match or exceed the new bid. We will evaluate the situation and make a decision in that timeframe. And we also received the expected $1.4 billion refund of our deposit from the FCC broadcast auction last week. Randall will provide more insight into our overall strategy in a few minutes. Now let's look at our operations, starting with wireless. Those details are on slide 6. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations. The reintroduction of unlimited plans made an already competitive market even more so. We were disciplined with our response, which was to launch new Unlimited Plus plans that give customers a $25 credit for bundling DIRECTV or DIRECTV NOW with their mobile service. And earlier this month we announced a limited promotion for free HBO for our Unlimited Plus customers. The changes in the market did impact our postpaid net adds, especially in the first part of the quarter before we began offering our new Unlimited plans. Our moves to combine the value of mobile with video have had the desired positive effect. In fact, trends are now back to where things stood before Unlimited plans were reintroduced by our competitors back in February. Revenues were also impacted by fewer phone sales. We had our lowest ever postpaid upgrade rate of 3.9% in the quarter, selling 1 million fewer phones than a year ago, while bring-your-own-device customers remained strong. This obviously impacted equipment revenues and to a lesser degree some service revenues. But, despite all the competitive noise in the quarter, we turned in our best-ever EBITDA margins. Our EBITDA margin was 41.8% with wireless service margins of 49.3%. Postpaid phone-only churn was also a record first quarter low of 0.90%. But with the lower phone sales, we also had fewest postpaid tablet net adds in more than five years, adding about 100,000 new tablets. We did add more than 2 million subscribers, as record connected device net adds and a solid prepaid quarter helped to offset tougher postpaid and reseller results. We also continue to grow our branded smartphone base, adding nearly half a million smartphones in the quarter. Our Entertainment group also saw competitive pressure. Revenue and margins were relatively stable. West Coast storms did drive up expenses by about $100 million in the quarter, with about two-thirds of that allocated to our Entertainment group and the rest to Business Solutions. But these costs, along with higher content costs and our investments in DIRECTV NOW, were largely offset by merger synergies and disciplined cost management. Linear TV subscriber gross adds were consistent with previous quarters, but with annual price increases due to content costs going up. Churn was up, particularly in markets where we don't have broadband to bundle with video. Competitive pressure from cable and the increasing number of over-the-top video alternatives resulted in our video subscribers declining in the quarter. We're taking steps to address the situation, including simplifying offers and bundling with unlimited wireless. At the same time, DIRECTV NOW is an important part of our strategy and continues to add customers. We deliberately pulled back on marketing to give the platform time to mature and improve, and we're seeing just that. You should expect us to be more aggressive with DIRECTV NOW in the second half of the year, with additional features and content. Last week we added 14 FOX affiliates to DIRECTV NOW. You should expect we will be targeting those cities with additional marketing. We're still only five months since the DTV NOW launch, but we like what we see and feel very good about the service and where it's headed. Broadband had a very strong quarter, with 115,000 subscribers added. Our moves to simplify pricing are paying off, and our fiber deployment is making inroads. AT&T fiber is now in 52 metro areas and marketed to 4.6 million customer locations. We expect to add 2 million fiber locations this year, to reach 6 million by the end of the year, and to meet our 12.5 million merger commitment goal by 2019. Now let's look at Business Solutions on slide 7. In the business segment, we saw weaker demand than we expected. U.S. business investment as a percent of GDP continues to be low. Growth expectations in the economy have been rising, but we've yet to see that translate into economic gains or demand. We're still hopeful that growing consumer confidence and the possibly of tax reform will turn into increased business investment later this year, but the near-term view is cautious. We also continue to see the impact of technology shifts away from the traditional voice lines and other legacy services. Customers are still buying our strategic business services, which were up more than $200 million in the quarter. And wireless service revenues grew in the quarter, but lower equipment sales pressured overall results. Like in other parts of our business, we stayed ahead with a relentless focus on cost efficiencies. You can see that in our margins. Margins actually expanded by 90 basis points and were the highest in four years, and that included improvements in both wireline and wireless margins. Our business team is doing a good job in a tough situation. Increasing profitability in a challenging revenue environment is not easy. Meanwhile, our international businesses had a very good quarter. We grew revenues in both our Latin American and Mexican operations, improved margins and added customers. In fact, EBITDA has more than doubled year over year. We've made a lot of headway in building our network and our brand in Mexico. We now reach 85 million people with our LTE networks; we've rebranded, updated, and opened new stores and trained our people. We are now actively scaling our customer base to match those investments. We added 3 million subscribers last year, and we had a good start to this year by adding more than 600,000 new customers in the first quarter. That brings our customer base to 12.6 million. Revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially and year over year. Latin America satellite operations also showed revenue growth and margin expansion. Revenues were up more than 10%, even when excluding the foreign exchange lift in the quarter. The bottom line for our video business in Latin America is that it's profitable and continues to generate positive free cash flow. Now, before I turn this over to Randall, let me quickly review our outlook for the year. As we told you earlier in the year, when the FirstNet contract was officially awarded, we would update our 2017 guidance, and we'll update again following the close of the Time Warner acquisition. Because the FirstNet state opt-in process is expected to flow into the fourth quarter, FirstNet is now expected to have little impact on our 2017 P&L results. That being said, the FirstNet build efforts and reimbursement process might have a manageable impact on CapEx and cash flows, depending upon the timing of FirstNet reimbursement. So as it relates to guidance we're still expecting adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range. We're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion even in the current competitive environment. Our capital spending guidance remains in the $22 billion range, but with FirstNet it could be at the higher end of that $22 billion range. And free cash flow is expected to be in the $18 billion range, and it may be a little bit on the low end of the range with the timing of the FirstNet reimbursements. You'll notice that we have stopped providing revenue guidance. The reason is pretty simple : Upgrades rates are hitting record lows. Our revenue forecasts depend on how many phones we expect to sell during the year, and that's uncertain. And we don't know how much demand there will be for any of the new product offerings that come out. Changes in customer phone buying habits have minimal impact on our profitability, but it does make revenue forecasts more unpredictable. With that, I would now like to hand this over to Randall Stephenson, who is going to provide a strategic update on our overall business. Randall? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, John. Listen, I thought what we'd do before we get into the strategy update is just \u2013 I wanted to just give you my take on the quarter, and there's just a handful of things that stood out. And the first was that churn was up significantly on our standalone pay TV product, and that's where TV isn't bundled with our other services. And that's really what's behind the decline in TV subscribers for the quarter. And so you should expect us to make some adjustments in the market to address that as we move into the rest of the year. The second thing I'd call out is the performance in cost management. And to grow EPS \u2013 and John pointed this out, but to grow EPS and cash flow and expand margins in this kind of competitive environment I think is noteworthy, and it doesn't happen without some really terrific execution in driving costs out. And it's that execution on the cost side that gives us a lot of confidence to reaffirm our profit outlook for the year, and that's a big deal. My third observation is one that John talked at length about, and that's the return of unlimited plans. And obviously this has made an already competitive market even more so. And our response to the unlimited data plans was probably a little slow. And we lost some share in the quarter, but it was really important that our unlimited offers be unique and play to our strengths. And John talked about this as well a little bit. But we're combining our unlimited with some significant discounts on TV and free HBO, and as these offers are now in the market our subscriber metrics have returned to kind of the same levels they were before all these unlimited offers began. And kind of the sum of it is it appears the industry has gone through a lot of activity during the quarter and has essentially landed back in the same place where it started. So what the return of unlimited really highlights, and that is the industry's position in terms of network capacity, because if the industry is going to stay with unlimited, we're prepared and can probably sustain it better than anyone else because of our spectrum position. And it is the best in the industry. And this would probably be a good place to talk about the foundation that we've built for a world of intense video consumption in the world of mobility, and so let's go to slide 10. This network we've built, it was designed for video. And our LTE network covers more than 400 million people in Latin America, and this morning we announced that we're significantly increasing the network speeds in several major cities this year as part of our 5G evolution. And Austin is now live. Indianapolis will turn up this summer, and then at least 18 additional markets will be turned up later this year. And then we have the new Samsung Galaxy S8, which is the first device that's going to be able to take advantage of these higher speeds. Obviously our satellite distribution is very well-equipped for a world with 4K video, and it covers the U.S. and most of Latin America. We have the largest fiber footprint in the country. We pass nearly 6 million business locations with fiber today, and we're in the process of deploying fiber to more than 12.5 million customer locations by 2019. Now, this fiber footprint is proving to be a huge competitive advantage as the industry is moving towards 5G. We're also leading the industry in software-defined networking, and this is the driving force behind our cost structure. And it's also changing how we deliver new services. And then on spectrum, it became clear several years ago as we began to anticipate a world of premium mobile video that spectrum would be the difference maker. So we took a deliberate strategic approach to building up our position, and today we have the leading spectrum position in the U.S., and I'm going to discuss that more here in a moment. All these investments are creating a very unique platform for what we think is a very unique customer base. It's 147 million mobile subscribers, 47 million pay TV subscribers, a fast-growing OTT video service, and 16 million broadband subscribers. And if you look at slide 11, I now want to drill down on this spectrum position that we've spoken of a lot here on this call. We picked up 20 megahertz of nationwide mid-band spectrum with our WCS acquisition back in 2012. Recall this is where we picked up a lot of companies and the FCC helped us get these licenses for mobile broadband. Then we bought another 20 megahertz of mid-band spectrum in the 2015 spectrum auction, and that block covers virtually the entire country. Then after extensive assessment of the FirstNet RFP, we set winning the contract as a top priority for this company. We worked it hard, and our effort paid off last month. And along with winning FirstNet, we get another 20 megahertz of premium low-band spectrum to build this network. And then any surplus capacity can be used for our commercial customers. And then finally we shut down our analog 2G network last year, and we're redeploying that spectrum nationwide as well. So you add it all up. We now have more than 60 megahertz of fallow spectrum that we're ready to light up, and we'll be deploying all the bands simultaneously starting this fall when states begin to opt in to the FirstNet. The efficiencies we'll gain from climbing the tower once to put up multiple bands of spectrum, those efficiencies are significant. And we're going to see those cost savings and the network performance materialize immediately and then throughout the life of this multiyear buildout. And so with that, let's talk about 5G. As you know, it requires higher band spectrum that can transmit huge amounts of data over very short distances. So earlier this year we announced our first millimeter wave acquisition with FiberTower. And this gives us a very nice nationwide deep footprint in the higher bands. We filed for the license transfer, and we expect the FCC to approve this in late summer. Then a few weeks ago we announced our intent to acquire Straight Path and its nationwide millimeter licenses, and there's now a competing offer, as John pointed out, and we're going to be evaluating that over the next few days and decide how to respond. The bottom line : We've built the overall leading spectrum position that's going to allow us to fulfill our goal. And our goal is to put 1 gig speeds in our customers' hands no matter where they are on our network. Before I get to your questions, I'd like to briefly address what's been going on in Washington, and there's an outline of that on slide 12. It's obviously been an amazing few months in our industry. And there's clearly a return to a lighter touch pro-growth regulatory philosophy, and that's not only in our industry but it's across all industries right now, and we think this is incredibly positive for our country and that it could catalyze the economic growth all of us have been looking for. On the Time Warner deal approval, it's moving along as expected. The European Commission has approved it. The Department of Justice is now reviewing it, and we're working closely with them to answer any questions that they may have. On the FCC side, since there are no license transfers involved, we don't anticipate the FCC will review it at all. So bottom line, we continue to expect approval of the deal end of this year. On regulation in general, the changes at the FCC have been quite positive. The controversial rules around business data services that had been proposed earlier have been abandoned, and they've been replaced by a logical, commonsense approach that preserves competition. The proposed set-top box regulations are now off the table. On data privacy, the president has signed legislation that should give us a consistent set of rules that apply equally to all companies. And then Title II regulation is under review, and I want to be real clear about this. We do continue to support fundamental tenets of net neutrality, and we remain committed to open Internet rules that are fair and equal to all players. However, we do continue to think it's illogical to regulate the Internet using rules that were put in place 83 years ago for the rotary dial telephone. We're hopeful the FCC will follow through on that as well. On corporate tax reform, we continue to believe that something does get done this year, but the timing and the magnitude of it are anybody's guess. But achieving competitive corporate tax rates, this is probably the biggest catalyst available for our public policymakers if they want to increase capital investment and job creation, so we think this is really important. And so with that, Mike, I'm going to hand it back to you, and we can go to questions. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Kathy, we're ready for the Q&As, and we'll take our first caller. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead, please. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe first on the - Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Hey, John. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Hey. How you guys doing? First on the satellite business, or the linear TV, are you guys seeing cannibalization from the DIRECTV NOW product? And the churn you mentioned, is there a way you could ascribe it to maybe traditional competitors versus these over-the-top guys? And have you seen that accelerate since the launch of YouTube TV a few weeks ago? That's first. And then maybe on the Straight Path and FiberTower deals, could you just comment on how quickly you think that gets deployed? And is the holdings of the millimeter wave spectrum that you would have if you were able to successfully complete the Straight Path transaction, is that sort of what you need to sort of fulfill your sort of 5G initiatives? Thanks. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I'll start, John, and I'll let John Stephens clean up after me, okay? On the satellite question, there's obviously some cannibalization of DIRECTV NOW, but it's fairly nominal, to be quite honest with you. The satellite churn that I referenced, I mean, it is heavily concentrated, John, in those customers where we just have a standalone TV product. It's not bundled with broadband or it's not bundled with our wireless service. And so obviously it's a world where the integrated offers are what's winning in the marketplace. And so you can figure out who we're losing those subscribers to; it's traditional cable players. And so this is where we're going to have to get aggressive in a number of areas, moving aggressively on bundling these satellite customers with our wireless offers and also doing some new things in the marketplace that we think can shore this up. But it's no secret where these are coming from; it's coming from integrated offers from other players in the market. And where we have multi-product bundles in the marketplace, those customers, the churn rates continue to be very strong. And in fact you saw our postpaid phone churn, 0.9%. You put TV or broadband with it, and those churn rates just get even better. So we continue to be big, big advocates of the integrated bundle and multiple service bundles. And so we don't see that changing. It's going to require us to get a little more aggressive in those single-play, standalone TV offers. On Straight Path and FiberTower, so we've talked at length about when the standards are going to be out for 5G. I think we're now in 2018 time horizon. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: 2018. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: And so having equipment and handsets, we're talking 2019 before we start deploying in 2020 when you probably have what I would call scaled offerings. If we get both Straight Path and FiberTower accomplished, it pretty much fills our spectrum requirements we need for a long period of time as it relates to 5G deployment, John. So right now this is all preparing for the future of 5G, and the standards are on track, and we hope to be deploying and putting this spectrum to work in the 2018-2019 timeframe, scaling in 2020. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: John, with regard to that on \u2013 as Randall said, the FiberTower itself gives us a base of 39 gigahertz nationwide to really build on and plan on. And so that in and of itself is a great starting point and gives our network team an opportunity to incorporate that planning into our project evolution and this next-generation network. When you look at Straight Path, it really has two holdings, the 39 gigahertz, which would complement FiberTower's and give us that depth that we would prefer, and so that would be great, but it also adds a strong 28 gigahertz piece, which we could incorporate into our network and use that way, or we could, as we've done in the past, use as an opportunity for spectrum swaps to take advantage of other opportunities. I can give you a perfect example; this last quarter I mentioned that we had about a $100 million gain on the spectrum swap with Verizon, where we traded some PCS and AWS \u2013 three licenses to get both of ourselves in a better position to serve our customers. So that's where I'd leave us. The 39 gigahertz would be a great depth of position, and quite frankly with FiberTower an opportunity to really plan on that build as we go into project evolution. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, John. You mentioned project evolution. Can we talk about the timing of the FirstNet process and evolution? My impression is you have a lot of pressure to get that deployed, and given the timing of the state build process it could take a while. What are the things we should be watching to see this ramp up, and what happens in states where you don't get the state to come along on your FirstNet effort? And then, Randall, can you just talk quickly about \u2013 how do you see \u2013 I guess this is also for John, though. Any big issues in the corporate tax discussion that you might see out there, that we should be sort of cognizant of? Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So, hey, Phil, good afternoon. First of all, in the FirstNet process, we'll post the state plans here in June, open up the opportunity for the states to opt in. We'll actively work with the states, try to answer any questions, concerns they have, stay and (30:06) work with them and with the FirstNet organization, who have been really good to work with, and convincing the states that opting in is the right answer. So we'll go through that process through the summer and hope to get the states to move as quickly as possible with the, if you will, encouragement, that we are ready to go, and the first ones that opt in are going to get that first investment in their state, that build in their state, that job creation in their state. So we think that's a good strategy. Secondly, with regard to your question about opting out, there's a couple of things that make it challenging, I think, for a state to go down that route. One is, there is a collection of funding that's related to the contract winner, ourselves, with regard to setting some national standards, setting up portals and other abilities to communicate with FirstNet responders, to communicate with states, to set national standards of interoperability, and so forth. Those monies are committed to the award winner and not to the states. Secondly, if the states choose to go it alone, they take the risk of any project cost overruns. And third, they generally don't have \u2013 and quite frankly one of our largest competitors doesn't have any owned network in the states to rely on, so they have a huge catch-up to do with a company like ours. So we feel really good about the process and think that we are going to \u2013 we'll be very cooperative, we'll be very encouraging with the states to work with them, to make sure they feel comfortable. But our target is all 56 \u2013 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. We want to win them all, and that's our goal, so that's how we'll go about it. Randy, you want to take corporate tax? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I'll talk corporate tax. We can tag-team this one, too, because John is actively involved with folks in Congress on this. But, look, there appears to be significant motivation and significant interest by all parties to get our corporate tax rate to a more competitive level, and you can't find anybody in Washington \u2013 you might be able to find one or two, but it's rare to find even somebody in Washington who would argue that our tax rates are uncompetitive on corporations. So there is a definite interest in seeing this move. From a business standpoint, what we're all advocating is really simple : It's got to be a competitive rate, and it needs to be a territorial system for taxing profits overseas. And if it was just a matter of trying to get to a competitive rate, that is probably achievable in short order. If you said what's a competitive rate, 25%, 26%, 27%, that's probably inherently achievable, and that would be very advantageous to the U.S. But I think there are some who aspire to try to do better than that, and you heard the president just this week articulate a desire and in fact challenged his team in the White House to get to a 15% rate. Now, we would obviously stand up and cheer; we'd be huge advocates of that. But I think the practical reality of getting to 15% is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation. So can you get some fashion of dynamic scorekeeping to justify it? The second is to get to a 15% rate without just blowing out the budget, you probably have to consider things like either VATs or border adjustment taxes, and we know the emotion that those are met with across the country. Now, we would probably be supportive, candidly, AT&T, if we could get a tax rate to 15%, we would be supportive of those kind of vehicles to make it happen, but we as a business may be in a minority in terms of entities receptive to those kind of vehicles to help get the tax rate down. So there's going to be a lot of thrashing on this in Congress and with the White House in terms of really what is the objective and if the president is committed to a 15% tax, it's going to have to \u2013 it's going to take some kind of really serious changes in how we tax corporations to get there. Which we happen to think would be quite positive to economic growth and capital investment in this country. What would you add, John? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, with that economic growth, capital investment drives revenue for us, and that's really as important as the tax savings that driving those revenues would really be significant. And we would be able to invest with the cash flow benefit on a more rapid pace than even we are now. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: What's interesting is \u2013 you remember the Dave Camp proposal. You can get to a 25% to 28% rate just by getting rid of all the loopholes and exclusions, and that would be nice, that would be really helpful, but \u2013 and I think it would stimulate some growth. It's just not game-changer, if you will. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So let me make one other comment about FirstNet to make sure (35:22). We'll make some investments here starting right away with regard to the portals, with regard to the interoperability standard, that kind of equipment, that kind of investment, and that could affect our operating expenses and our CapEx. But we'll get reimbursements from the FirstNet fund, and we're expecting those to kind of generally offset in this year. Secondly, the reason for the not-significant impact on our financial results in 2017 from the overall is that \u2013 two things. One, the states opting in probably in the fourth quarter timeframe, at least in large numbers. And two, the spectrum being put to use generally being up and running in probably 2018 and at the earliest late 2017, but probably more like 2018. In the accounting world, those two things will drive the accounting activity, and so the accounting for the spectrum costs and other things that are involved in this really don't start until you place that spectrum into service or until you've got completion of the state opt-in process. That's why we're saying, while there may be some impact, it's not going to be material. But I will add, if we were convinced that a state was opting in, if they had elected so and we had appropriate approvals from the state and the FirstNet authorities, we would be willing to start that investment process right away. We are anxious to get going, and we have the vendors lined up and the opportunity lined up to get it done. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks, guys. John, maybe just a quick comment on the wireless share loss, where you're seeing that. Is it more family share plans, or is it single lines and feature phones? And then on ARPU, what should we think about going forward as far as stabilization? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Mike. Let me say on the share loss, the feature phone continued to lose, but quite frankly with the unlimited plans being announced, we did see an uptick in the family plan losses and the attention on that. As we've come back with these unlimited plans and specifically with the offers to give the (37:43) $25 credit on DTV or DTV NOW and the opportunity for the HBO feature. We have seen the plans come back down, and we believe that part of the reason that's coming back to, if you will, normal or to pre-unlimited offer rates is because it's holding onto the families. We still need to go through that. It's been just a couple, three weeks, so it's early. But, yes, we did see some impact on both the standalone, if you will, feature phone type that we've seen in the past and the family plan. With regard to ARPU, I would suggest to you we still have a little bit to go with regard to ARPU because we have really smart customer base, and they go through this process of figuring out which is the best plan for them and going to it, and that'll continue on. Secondly, we still have some customers on plans that have overage. And, as I said, if they're smart customers, they will migrate over to these unlimited plans and work through that. But we are \u2013 I will tell you, if you look at our service revenues for the quarter, about 1% of the decline was really related to a decision we made last year to get out of the resale business in one of our specific large resale contracts, or to reduce that business, because the prices just weren't appropriate, and capacity was going to be important to us for our quality customers. And so we've seen some of the service revenue declines based on our decisions to back off of that reseller market, and I think you saw that in our customer counts. You saw it in our customer counts this quarter, but you saw it in our customer counts at the end of last year in the reseller market. And that was just a solid business decision we made based on realization \u2013 ARPU and per meg realization. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one would be, John, for you. If we kind of look at the mid-single digit earnings per share growth target, it kind of implies that we've got to maintain this $0.74 level of earnings for most of the rest of the year, and coming off the kind of all-time low handset upgrade rate, it's more likely than not it's going to be a headwind as we go into the Galaxy and then the iPhone later this year. Can you kind of walk us through the geography of the income statement, where we offset those headwinds and generate the kind of positive mid-single digit earnings growth? And then the second question, if I could, would be maybe either for you or maybe Randall, just on this SD-WAN. It's a big emerging topic, a big conversation about whether it's a threat or an opportunity, especially for an incumbent like yourselves. And finally how real it is as a technology in the world. That would be super helpful. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Let me try the EPS question first, Dave. Let me go to this. If I harken back to a comment I made in a presentation that we had about a penny \u2013 $0.02 of pressure in the quarter, a penny from some legal settlements, some IP, and other issues; and quite frankly a penny from some storm costs. And we did not adjust for them. But if you look at our results, taking those out, you see the quarter of $0.76, and you can understand then that the growth rate goes up to just under 6%, and you can understand how we would feel that that quarter supports an ongoing activity. You're right; we could have a step up in equipment sales and upgrade rates. We're just admitting that we can't predict that at this time. But generally speaking, if that happens, we have significant offsets, whether it be the next accounting, whether it be the revenue recognition, or quite frankly if it's just the benefits of having customer additions and the additional service revenues and so forth. So that's something that does not scare us, so to speak. We can manage through that. The third thing is, as we mentioned, the entire team here has been really focused on costs. But as we go quarter by quarter, we continue to increase the network function virtualization percentages, and we're on this march from 34% at the end of last year to 55% at the end of this year. So that's just going to continue on in generating savings, and we're getting to that point where the mass or the base of savings that we have, getting it to 40% and 50%, starts overcoming the reinvestment dollars that are required to grow it. So all that put together, that's why we feel comfortable about staying in the hunt for that guidance and keeping things moving forward. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: On the SD-WAN, yeah, it's real. It tends to be real down-market, David, and you should assume that we're developing capability ourselves, because it's a viable offer down-market. We're seeing some effect from it. It's not material yet, but we think it's a legitimate capability. We need to be there; we need to have it. And so up-market, the traditional VPN capability is always, we think, is going to be the enduring capability. But down-market, we're going to have to be prepared to compete with this kind of offering. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: David, Mike just reminded me \u2013 one other thing I'll mention to you is that if you noticed that improvement we had in the first quarter in Mexico and the fact that that customer base is now close to 13 million \u2013 I think we're at 12.6 million. And it was an investment cycle all of last year, and it's starting to turn. The team down there is doing well. But I'd suggest to you that's another support for our business proposition for the year. We need to keep working at it, and we need to keep that market strengthening, but we feel good about the fact that that provides us another opportunity. Secondly, I will tell you that the DIRECTV Latin America properties are just really \u2013 it's a lot of elbow grease. It's a lot of hard work, but they're doing well for us in what is challenging environments. But they are producing, and that's helping, too. So they may not be the focus of most of our discussions, but they sure are helping with our efforts this year. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you both. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about some of the elevated churn you signaled where you have an unbundled video product. I think it's easy to envision some of the corrective measures you could take within your traditional landline region, especially in light of all the fiber that you're deploying. So I was hoping we could maybe just spend a little bit more time talking about how you think about fortifying the bundle that you can offer outside that traditional region. You talked a little bit about some of the millimeter wave licenses, but is there really a broader set of options you think you have to go into the market to make sure your bundle remains differentiated nationwide? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, there's a few things, Brett. In the short run, obviously it's bundling DIRECTV standalone with wireless outside of our traditional footprint where we don't have a broadband product. So bundling with wireless is really, really important. That is a part of the customer base, the standalone that has been also somewhat sheltered \u2013 is that the right word? \u2013 by virtue of being rural in nature. And so being rural in nature, it's harder to find an opportunity to bundle. Well, we have CAF II funding. We are turning up right now, wireless local loop is the term we use, but basically it's a wireless fixed broadband solution. 400,000 that we're turning up. We have an opportunity to turn up a lot of these. As we build FirstNet, by the way, we have to turn up significant improvements to our entire rural footprint, and so having a wireless opportunity to provide a broadband bundle into rural America really can shore up this customer base. And so traditional wireless \u2013 go immediately with bundling traditional wireless. Obviously there are some things we could do just on price, and we'll do some promotional things. But then getting our fiber local loop product that is being rolled out right now, being introduced as we speak, getting it targeted to these customers, can also shore this up. So it's a multi-pronged effort. And then longer term, you mentioned it. Longer term, 5G. This is the nationwide broadband opportunity. As we turn up 5G, we can now have a very high speed, competitive-with-cable broadband offering in all the major metropolitan countries where we don't have traditional fixed line footprint. So it's about to be a new competitive game as we get into the world of 5G, and we're getting very, very enthusiastic about it. And just what I would call fixed type configurations of 5G will come out before mobile configurations. So 2018, we'll be doing some fixed line deployments of 5G, and you'll be seeing some of that. And even the offerings, the speed increases we're doing right now in Austin that we just announced, we're talking competitive to cable speeds on our wireless network in Austin, soon to be Indianapolis and 18 other markets this year. So the competitive landscape is changing, and I think \u2013 we are convinced it's going to change faster than a lot of people believe it will, that we're going to have some truly substitutable capabilities in the wireless infrastructure with some of our fixed line competitors. So we're optimistic, and we still think the bundle offering is going to be very, very important in the long term. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure, Brett. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Amir. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Hey, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understanding that fluctuations in handset sales are the primary driver for your shift in your top line guidance policy, I was wondering if you could provide some color on how you think about the cash flow trajectory of the business? John, I know you mentioned there are some fluctuations depending on the timing of FirstNet reimbursements this year, but how should we think about the long-term ability to grow cash flow organically against this evolving competitive landscape, and potentially inclusive of Time Warner? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: That's a good question, Amir. I mean, I feel really good about our opportunities to carry cash flow. And the best way I can explain it is what we saw on margins. The margins improvement was up and down from this cost initiatives, whether we talk about network function virtualization, whether we talk about digitization, whether we talk about automation, whether we \u2013 even as we have some challenges with regard to our legacy revenues, we have opportunities then to shed legacy costs. So I'm comfortable with where we're at on cash flows for the year. I will also tell you, the oddity of it is, handsets slow down, we have the outlay for handsets on an up-front basis, and then receive monthly payments for the \u2013 payments over time. So, as that happens, even with our next financing with the banks, it actually can relieve some of the pressure off of the companies because the next outlay for, if you will, the equipment outlay for handsets, actually slows. You guys know the background on the Time Warner and its capability to generate cash, and its much different capital intensity structure, as well as its great margin business, so we're very excited on being able to combine the two, about being able to farm out some growth initiatives and some cost savings, and so we look forward to that. We are still on a track to grow cash flows that we believe is so important, to not just \u2013 and not at all \u2013 I mean, it's very important to sustain and continue to grow the dividend. But not just that, but to create real wealth and opportunities and flexibility for the company on a going-forward basis. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then just one follow up, if I may. Seems like we're beginning to see demonstrable shifts in the regulatory landscape. For example, as you mentioned, Randall, we saw recent developments in BDS legislation, and it also seems like we may see some updated thoughts on the future of net neutrality in the coming days. How do you feel about the prospects of your integrated service provider offering against this shifting regulatory backdrop? In other words, are there new opportunities for monetizing your portfolio of assets in ways that previously may not have been available? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I would tell you the area that we are most focused on, and we're obviously very cautious about ensuring that we get our customers' consent to use data. But as we bring Time Warner into the family at AT&T, we are convinced that we can really enhance Time Warner's advertising revenue streams by virtue of some of the customer data, the viewership data, that we have on the distribution side of the house. And, as an example, we have a little advertising business on the AT&T side today. It's about a $1.5 billion business, and it's growing at double digits. And what we're doing with customer consent where appropriate, we're doing addressable advertising, and getting very localized on the advertising that's delivered to our customers. And we're getting revenues per impression that are 3x and 4x what you would consider traditional revenue per impression in this industry. Well, to what extent can we have that same type of impact on the Time Warner, the Turner Network advertising revenues, which are much more substantial than the AT&T revenue streams? And so there are some opportunities there. As the rules are clarified as it relates to the utilization of data, and then we have our own policies in terms of getting customer consent and working hard to get our customer consent to do this. But this provides new opportunities for new revenue streams and just improving yield on existing revenue streams. And then obviously there was a lot of consternation at the end of last year with the former FCC surrounding things like sponsored data and set-top box and so forth. Well, all of those issues and those concerns are now gone, and so the ability to do some unique pricing on sponsored data and so forth are now in front of us and available to us, and in a world of unlimited it changes how that looks and so forth. But as we have the need to use flexibility to differentiate our offers, it gives us some new opportunities to do those things. So we're actually very positive. The thing I'm most encouraged about, though, with the new tone in the FCC, is it probably, Amir, doesn't offer a whole lot of new opportunity for new services, but it takes a decision point out of the investment philosophy. If you want to invest in a new capability, if you want to invest in fixed wireless local loop, if you want to invest in 5G, you don't have this stop, pause, how is this going to be regulated? We have a pretty good idea now that it's going to be regulated with somewhat of a light touch as long as there's competitive alternatives in the marketplace, and that just changes the whole investment philosophy, and I think it's going to free up investment as we move forward. And you combine that with tax reform, I think even this industry that has been the top investor in the country for the last five years, this industry can actually go higher in investment if you get these kind of changes. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much for the incremental color. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: You bet. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about fiber. With Verizon's announcement last week, it's kind of a game-changer, as you alluded to, in terms of out-of-network footprint. And as you expand fiber, I assume it's easier to do so in your own ILEC footprint. What are your thoughts on outside that ILEC footprint? Will you pursue a similar path? And does that require further fiber investment or possible acquisitions? Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So, Jennifer, let me take a stab at it, and I'll ask Randall to comment on it. But first and foremost, I think we need to get some clarity with regard to how we measure fiber and whether you measure it by miles of fiber covered or by strands within the payer, within the fiber itself. That gives a differentiating aspect to the magnitude of the dollars being talked about in the marketplace. But you're right, we're on a significant investment in fiber with the 12.5 million fiber-to-the-prem, but quite frankly, because of our legacy of our business, both the local exchange business which we've held onto in that historic Bell operating company business which gives us a tremendous footprint, but also the legacy Long Lines business, which had fiber throughout the country. And so we do have more fiber than anyone else as it exists today. What we look at, though \u2013 and we're open. We make evaluations on build or buy all the time with regard to backhaul for towers and that kind of fiber initiatives. What we will do is we will look at all the opportunities out there and decide whether it's going to be cheaper to buy or build. But we are open to it. We believe we have a big lead because of what we've been doing over the last five years in our VIP investments. We believe we have a big lead because we have the largest, if you will, legacy consumer business and the footprint associated with the Bell operating companies, and we also have a big lead with regard to the extensive fiber that was part of the AT&T Long Lines business. So when you put all of that together, we feel very good about it. We continue to invest, I would suggest, at \u2013 as much as, if not more than anybody's investing right now in fiber. It's very significant. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I mean, we've talked about this for many years, Jennifer, and obviously, we gave some thought and consideration to would we create value if we separated our fixed line and our wireless business a few years ago. And I've got to tell you, the thing that caused you the greatest pause as you thought about doing those things was this wireless business is going to need the fiber access. It's going to need that last mile fixed line access. And so having a big footprint of fixed line access was always going to be critical. And as we now move into the world of 5G, as we're deploying fiber to 12.5 million homes, it's just \u2013 you're looking for the capillaries. If you deploy to a home, what capillaries does that make available for deploying small cells? What capillaries are now being run to businesses? And so it's just \u2013 it begins to feed on itself and the incremental costs of that next kind of layer of fiber goes down. And then, as John said, we make literally daily decisions outside our traditional footprint on lease versus buy, and there's plenty of fiber available. Dark fiber is available in virtually all metropolitan areas, and so our ability to buy access to fiber for 5G is readily available. And where the cost or the availability isn't there, we will run fiber. So I think the U.S. is going to see a lot of fiber being deployed over the next few years as a byproduct of 5G, and I like where we stand in that race. I think we start with a head start. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Jennifer, one other thing I'd add is, and this could be repeated kind of on every question we've had, but the FirstNet contract award and the requirements that it provides to build out a nationwide first responder network and the funding that it provides to do that, gives us a great opportunity to incorporate \u2013 and the team has done this \u2013 incorporate fiber builds and fiber requirements both \u2013 not only for FirstNet in and of itself but anything they can leverage off of that. And we do this with building \u2013 as we've talked about before with the one tower climb and putting the AWS-3, the WCS spectrum to use at the same time we're doing the 700 MHz, but in all aspects of the FirstNet contract, it's providing us a real opportunity to leverage off the existing fiber and then to further add to what we consider to be the lead in that market that we have. Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much for the color. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: And, Kathy, this is Mike. We're going to only be able to take one more call. I apologize to the folks that are in the queue. We won't be able to get all the calls in tonight. But we'll take one more. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: John and Randall are taking too much time answering questions, aren't we? Operator : Okay. Thank you. Then our final question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Many thanks. So, John, I understand the uncertainty around the phone sales. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what exactly are you hearing from the field? Is this the natural impact of EIP? Is this people \u2013 just no form factor change? Do you expect this to come back? The Galaxy's obviously been delayed. Any more color around should we be thinking about there's something that has changed dramatically or this is just a pause and we'll get back to some more normal rates? And then, Randall, just continuing on the fiber, you've talked about the 12 million. What's the strategy for the copper getting the speeds up to have a competitive broadband product there where you may not be planning to roll fiber right now? What can you do with those lines to stay competitive? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Let me take the phone sales first, Simon. And quite frankly, you made a lot of the right points. The first thing is we are seeing a change with regard to next, if you will, and the impact that customers have \u2013 are understanding the costs of a phone differently; they're reacting differently. We're saying that not only in the slower (1:00:44), but we continue to have in this kind of 400,000 or 500,000 a quarter BYOD devices. So not only are they \u2013 when they do buy another phone, they are holding onto the other one and handing it down, giving it to someone else to use. And so we're seeing that. That is an impact of it. There has been a lot of discussion that most of the changes in the phone's capabilities are software enabled. We talk about it wanting to do it from our network perspective. We're seeing a little bit of it in the handset business, where the upgrades to the capabilities are software focused as opposed to form factors. So that's it. We are actually seeing, so to speak, a slowness in overall consumer activity. It seems like while the consumers \u2013 the economics and the consumer world may be improving, it seems like they're being very careful, and so that's a third thing. We have studied it, everything from the amount of tax refund dollars that impacts and when that comes in to all those things we've looked at. I would suggest to you I think it is a more permanent change in the environment because of the change in who pays for it. I don't believe \u2013 I'm not trying to suggest it's going to stay at this 30.9% rate. I would expect that it will come back, not only for new phones coming out but quite frankly, for example, as we, if you will, get our network even hotwired more than it is as the Austin-type situation, where you can get multiple hundred meg speeds on your phones, you'll see people want to get those devices, so I think that'll help. But I clearly believe it is a permanent change from where we were in the subsidy model, and I believe that the upgrade rates will be down on a permanent basis. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: And the copper plant, Simon, it's real simple. It's wireless. It's 5G and that's, I mean, we'll continue to push the envelope with fiber deeper and deeper, but you get to a place on the fixed line side where it doesn't make sense to keep running fiber and economically. And our default architecture long-term, default architecture, is a wireless architecture, and so the world of 5G, that's when the copper gets replaced with a high-speed wireless offering to the home. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: How close does the fiber have to get to the home for that vision? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: It obviously depends on what speeds you want, right? But if you think about where we have copper today, you don't have a ton of situations where you need a gig of bandwidth. But, as we said, our objective is to get a gig of bandwidth to everybody we touch. And so in a world of 5G, you should think of a 200-meter propagation, all right, so that takes a lot, but you don't need in suburban and rural America those kind of bandwidths to be competitive. And so you can go to your traditional cell structure, use more traditional spectrum positions, and get very competitive speeds in those areas with wireless, even with an LTE arrangement. So think about the configuration in Austin. You're going to get some serious, serious bandwidth there. You have the potential for 500 or 600 meg. Now, obviously on a loaded network you're going to get about a tenth of that, but 50, 60 meg? That's a competitive offer, and we think we have a lot of legs with that and that over time just keep pushing the small cell structure deeper and deeper. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: We haven't mentioned, and I think you all know this, but with the move towards carrier aggregation and four-way, which the Galaxy S8 has the capability of doing that, with regard to MIMO and the ability to have the on- and off-ramps operate much quickly and move into that QAM 256, all three of those things are now available for us, and we're working this true (1:04:49) our Austin, and we're seeing tremendous, tremendous results there. So that's what's so encouraging about us, particularly about this continuation of wireless and this opportunity to support an overall broadband solution, as well as coordinate it with a FirstNet build that is consistent with the government's requirements. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Simon, I appreciate the question. With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call and just a couple closing comments. It was a competitive quarter, both in wireless and video for us, and we took some steps and made some adjustments in the market to try and address this, and we'll continue to do that. But at the same time, we were able to grow adjusted earnings and adjusted margins in this environment as we drove cost out of the business, kept going hard on software-defined networking, and a year from now I think we're going to look back on the return to unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and capacity really began. And we're prepared for the fight, we're ready to go. And so, thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentleman, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and choosing AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T second quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Michael Viola. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. Like Kathy said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to cover our results, and he'll also provide an update on technology and infrastructure as well as an update on Time Warner and the FirstNet process. And then we'll follow with a Q&A session. As always, our earnings materials are available on the new Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's going to include our news release, 8-K, investor briefing, associated schedules, et cetera. Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention our Safe Harbor statement that's on slide 2. The Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. So now let me turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Let's first look at our consolidated financial summary on slide 3. We included both a quarterly and a year-to-date view. While the second quarter provides a good snapshot, the year-do-date view actually provides a more complete picture of how we are performing in a challenging and competitive environment. Year to date, revenue has been pressured by fewer phone upgrades and declines in legacy services. At the same time, our cost containment efforts are paying off, and it's showing up in our margins and our earnings. What we're doing on the cost side drove a 120 basis point improvement in adjusted consolidated operating margins year to date. Earnings were strong. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.79, up almost 10% for the quarter and up 7% year to date. There are a few things driving this strong EPS performance; first, as I just mentioned, lower costs. We're taking out operating costs and at the same time providing customers with a better experience through more automation, more digital interactions, more software and analytics, and more of our network functions being virtualized. Second, our international operations are becoming more profitable. Our satellite business in Latin America continues to be profitable in a tough environment, and we are past the heaviest investment cycle in Mexico. And finally, there were a few one-time operational items in the second quarter such as operating taxes that did help results. But we also normalized more than $0.03 of items that would have helped even more, including gains from a spectrum slot, asset sales, and a one-time benefit savings. Even with all these moving pieces, we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range. At the same time, year-to-date cash from operations is solid. Our increased capital spending is reflected in our free cash flow. But once again, the guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect free cash flow in the $18 billion range for the year, albeit at the low end of the range. The timing of the FirstNet expenditures and reimbursements are expected to impact that number. And we still expect capital spending in the $22 billion range, subject to the FirstNet timing. Some of the differences between adjusted EPS and cash from operations in the second quarter and for the year reflect the depreciation changes we've previously discussed. I want to say we saw some (4:20) working capital lumpiness in this quarter, inventory and vendor payment changes, which we would expect to sort themselves out as we work our way through the rest of the year. In addition, integration costs, inclusive of the Time Warner deal, have been adjusted out of net income, but still impact free cash flow, same for the settlement payments for our pre-merger DTV legal case with the FTC that was previously announced and accrued. All these impacted the quarter, but we don't expect a repeat for the rest of the year, and we continue to maintain our $18 billion range guidance for free cash flow. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with Wireless. Those details are on slide 4. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations. It was another highly competitive quarter in Wireless. Our competitors tried just about every promotion in the marketing book. In fact, one of them even offered to give away their service for free for a year. We were prudent with our promotional activity. Instead, our focus was on giving customers a great video entertainment experience bundled with mobility. Our results speak for themselves. We grew our domestic branded phone base by 178,000, including 267,000 prepaid net adds. We grew our smartphone base by more than 0.5 million. We had a strong year-over-year and sequential postpaid improvement. We added 2.3 million subscribers. And customer loyalty was terrific, with our lowest-ever postpaid phone churn for any quarter at 0.79%. At the same time, our EBITDA margin matched last quarter's all-time high of 41.8%, and our EBITDA service margin was the best ever at 50.4%. These results speak to the fantastic job our Wireless teams are doing with cost management as well as the underlying strength of our Wireless customer base and business. Now, let's move to our Entertainment group results at the bottom of slide 4. Revenues and margin were relatively stable. Growth in IP and video services revenue offset legacy declines, and cost synergies and efficiencies offset pressure from content increases and startup costs for DIRECTV NOW. AdWorks revenues are [up] nearly 15% year over year. We continue to do well in addressable and local ad sales, utilizing our customer insights data. Addressable and local ads can generate CPMs that are 3 to 4 times that of our national sales, and we've been shifting more ad inventory to these areas to further improve our top line performance. Total broadband grew for the third straight quarter, overcoming what is normally a seasonally slow second quarter. The strategy to simplify pricing, cross-sell broadband with TV and wireless service, and expand our fiber footprint has been paying off. We're far down the road in completing our legacy DSL conversions to IP broadband. That conversion, combined with extending fiber to more than 5.5 million customer locations, is strengthening our broadband position. In fact, the number of broadband subscribers on speeds 18 megabits or higher has increased by nearly 1.6 million in the past year. Traditional video losses continued their recent trends. The second quarter traditionally has seasonal pressures, but we also are feeling the impact of the overall industry trend of more customers wanting mobile and over-the-top offerings. The pace of that change seems to have picked up a bit so far this year. We continued to improve our traditional TV offers by simplifying the pricing and bundling TV with broadband and wireless, but we also know that traditional TV service is not for everyone. Many are choosing our over-the-top offering, DIRECTV NOW. Half of our DTV NOW subscribers are coming from traditional pay-TV, mainly from our competitors, and the other half had no pay-TV service at all. We introduced this service at the end of last year and have now reached nearly 0.5 million subscribers. This has helped us keep our total video base essentially flat from a year ago. We continue to refine and improve DIRECTV NOW service. We recently launched our app on additional streaming devices, and we're continuing to increase the number of local channels that are available. And we're also beta testing a new platform that will include a cloud-based DVR. We'll broaden availability of this new video platform later this year. Speaking of our Entertainment group, it's been two years since we closed our acquisition of DIRECTV. You can see the progress on slide 5. One of the opportunities we highlighted two years ago was the potential of bundling services and its impact both on subscriber trends and churn. Our results tell the story. For example, the number of wireless subscribers who also have a TV service from us has increased by more than 4 million, or up 31%, since the close of the DTV deal. Conversely, TV subscribers with wireless plans have increased by nearly 1 million, or 18%. And the number of TV subscribers in our footprint with high-speed Internet service has increased by 10%. While this is impressive when you look at all traditional TV subscribers, it's even more so when you break out our DIRECTV and DIRECTV NOW customers. This includes those who have migrated from our IP TV service, which is something we intended. The number of wireless subscribers with DTV has increased by 72%, while the number of DTV subscribers with AT&T Wireless has increased by 1.7 million, or 52%, and the number of our DTV subscribers in our wireline footprint with our IP broadband has grown by more than 2.7 million, to 67% of DIRECTV customers. Bundling obviously helps subscriber and revenue growth, but perhaps the biggest impact is on wireless churn. We've seen postpaid churn fall 25 basis points since we closed the DIRECTV deal. We're doing this in one of the most competitive environments we've ever seen, and a big reason for this is the increasing attractiveness of our wireless and video bundles. In fact, if you look at any bundled customer, churn is lower when compared to customers with just a single service. These are our most valuable customers. We use the combined appeal of wireless, video, and broadband services to offer compelling packages that can't be easily replicated. It's a great way to differentiate our services in the noisy and competitive wireless and video marketplaces. We also have been making great headway with our fiber build. We have the largest fiber footprint in the country, and we are ahead of the plan to reach our 12.5 million new fiber customer locations FCC commitment by mid-2019. In fact, by the time it's all said and done, we could be looking at around 14 million fiber-to-the-prem customer locations. We're also on track to meet or beat the expected cost synergies from DIRECTV. We hit a $1.5 billion run rate with cost synergies at the end of last year, and we're on track to reach a $2.5 billion-plus synergy run rate next year. Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. We continue to see the similar historical pressures in our Business segment. Strategic Services and Wireless are working hard to overcome legacy wireline losses. We continue to make incredible strides in cost management while increasing the percent of revenues that come from Wireless and Strategic Services. That's driving higher margins even with wireline revenues declining. Let me give you one example of what we're talking about. Our legacy voice and data revenues were down more than $500 million year over year. But even with that pressure, EBITDA grew by more than $70 million, and EBITDA margins improved by 150 basis points. We're doing this by driving hard on cost management initiatives. Our focus is having the industry's best cost structure, and one way to do that is by implementing process automation and service efficiencies. Our industry leadership in software-defined networking also supports our cost management goals. More than 40% of our network functions are now virtualized, and by year end it should be 55%, with a long-term goal of 75% or better. Moving to our international operations at the bottom of slide 6, we saw solid improvement across our operations. Revenues grew and margins improved in both our Latin America and Mexico operations. In fact, EBITDA and EBITDA margins for our international segment have more than doubled year over year. We did see an EBITDA benefit from a one-time item in Brazil during the quarter. In Mexico, revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially and year over year. Revenues were up about 10%. We added close to 500,000 new subs in Mexico in the quarter to pass 13 million. Our LTE network now covers more than 88 million people, or just about 75% of the country. Looking further south, our Latin America pay-TV revenues were up more than 11%. Net adds were down, due mostly to seasonality in Argentina and losses in Brazil, but our video business in Latin America continues to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow. Before we get to your questions, we'd like to provide an update on several topics that many of you have asked about. Our business update is on slide 7. First, the Time Warner review process at the DOJ continues. We still expect to close the deal by year end, and we have the financing set up to do so. And our merger integration team is nearly complete with its plans for opportunities that this deal will make possible in advertising, bundling, and providing customers choice. Our goal is to hit the ground running once we receive final approval and build our leadership in the telecom, media, and technology space. Second, we continue to invest and improve our integrated networks. Our wireless networks reach more than 99% of all Americans. Our spectrum position is broad and deep. In the top 100 metro areas today, we have about 100 MHz of spectrum deployed. This spectrum capacity helps us meet the tremendous demand that the new unlimited plans provide. At the same time, we have about 60 MHz of additional spectrum. We'll deploy all these bands simultaneously with the FirstNet build. As you know, the cost savings from touching the tower only once are significant. Our evolution to 5G is underway. While 5G standards are still being finalized, we're laying the foundation for tomorrow's faster wireless speeds today with 5G Evolution. We also completed a successful trial of LTE-LAA, reaching peak speeds of 750 megabits. This is one of our first steps towards 5G and will provide faster wireless speeds and an enhanced experience for our customers who use our LTE network. We've already launched 5G Evolution in Austin and Indianapolis and expect to be available in more than 20 markets by year end. We also launched the second fixed wireless trial using Millimeter Wave technology to deliver an ultra-fast 5G network experience to more locations in Austin. The trial participants can stream live TV on the DIRECTV NOW app and experience faster broadband services, all over a fixed wireless 5G signal. By the end of 2017, we also expect to deploy LTE License Assisted Access and four-way carrier aggregation in areas of some 5G Evolution metros. LTE-LAA combines unlicensed spectrum with licensed spectrum through a carrier aggregation to increase network capacity, providing faster speeds and a better customer experience. We recently tested this technology in San Francisco, where we observed peak speeds of more than 750 megabits in a trial setting. We plan to expand LTE-LAA testing to additional areas of San Francisco and Indianapolis in the coming weeks. We continue to move software functions deeper into our network. This gives us incredible flexibility to change network functions almost instantly while providing better customer service and driving cost efficiencies. We've also embraced edge computing, which will drive low latency for 5G applications such as self-driving cars, augmented and virtual reality, robotic manufacturing, and much, much more. We're just scratching the surface here. Customers demand a powerful network with a seamless integrated solution. This makes our integrated network a powerful advantage for us. Now, I would like to update you on FirstNet, where we're really off to a fast start. That update is on slide 8. The timeline has been set and the opt-in process is underway. We delivered plans to each state last month. They can opt in at any time. Already, five states have said they're in, Arkansas, Kentucky, Iowa, Virginia, and Wyoming. And we are looking forward to announcing a number of additional states in the near future. These states are anxious to get started, and so are we. They want the highest quality network available for their first responders as soon as they can get it, not to mention the investment and jobs created by our FirstNet builds. We continue with our discussions with the other states and territories in this initial 45-day review period for the states. It will be followed by another 45-day response period for FirstNet to answer any questions or concerns the states may have. This will conclude by mid-September. Once that's completed, the official 90-day clock begins for states to make a decision. This is expected to start in mid-September, with final decisions due by mid-December. Work on the FirstNet network can begin once the state opts in, both hardware and software, and we're setting up a new business operation, sales, marketing, customer care, to serve these customers. The advantage for the states that opt in quickly are many. First responder subscribers will have immediate access to AT&T's existing nationwide LTE network. Those subs will immediately receive quality of service and priority access to AT&T's $180 billion network. Those subscribers will also have preemption status on our network, which is expected to be in place by the end of the year. FirstNet and AT&T take on all of the financial requirements of the build. No additional financial resources from the states are required. All of this is a powerful incentive for states to opt in. The FirstNet build will be an important event for the country, first responders, and the industry. We see this as a great opportunity for efficient expansion, not only by deploying 60 MHz of spectrum, but also by changing the curve of increasing tower costs. The build will require equipment installations and new towers. We've closely watched unit costs and have been focused on creating a diverse community of suppliers and tower companies to increase competition and reduce costs. We're studying our options. We're looking hard at new relationships. We're open to new or independent operators who may want AT&T as a customer and support a new model. The point is there's more than one way to get this work done, and we are committed to finding a way that meets the needs of our customers while keeping costs in line with industry economics. So in summary, we had a very good quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of executing in a very competitive environment. Our cost containment efforts are paying off both in margins and earnings, and we're off to a great start with FirstNet. With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for our Q&A. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, Kathy, we're ready for questions, and you can get started immediately. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, folks. John, I was wondering if we could chat a bit on the progress that you guys are seeing in bundling video and wireless. You folks saw a material reduction in postpaid phone-only churn. Is there any way to quantify how much benefit you've received from bundling DIRECTV NOW in those promotions? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: First of all, thanks for the question, Amir. I think the way to look at it, it's really as we displayed on slide five. You can see that overall reduction in the total postpaid phone churn, and you can see the dramatic improvement over the, if you will, two years since the merger. And in those two years, another major activity that's gone on is dramatically increased competition, pricing that's somewhat challenging, people giving away service for a year free. So I think that slide, that presentation, shows it. If you look up and see the details that we provided or the details I provided in my comments, it's pretty clear this ability to bundle, whether it be TV Everywhere, whether it's DTV NOW, whether it's the ability to get all of your video on your phone is making a huge difference. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent, that's very helpful, and then just a quick follow-up, if I may. How should we think about the different puts and takes on the opportunity set for continuing to expand your margins? We continue to see improvement on wireless margins as a whole. It does seem as though there is an investment taking place on the video side with respect to DTV NOW, and then there is continued margin progress in the international operations. But if we think about the progress and the capabilities going forward, can you walk us through the opportunity set you still see going forward? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure, let me go through it this way. On a longer-term view, we're going to continue to see wireless revenue opportunities in prepaid. We're going to continue to see them in connected devices. Quite frankly, for us we're going to continue to see real opportunity not only in the immediate future but over time in FirstNet and what it provides. So those will be very important. And quite frankly, when you have churn at these levels, if you can maintain it, it's a gift that keeps on giving with regard to revenues and margins. Secondly, if we think about this movement to equipment installment plans, we've essentially gone through that process and have completed that, which had some changes in our service revenue metrics. We've made it through the vast majority of that. So then you go through the next process we're going through with this move to unlimited, and we certainly have been through the higher dollar amounts, if you will, on the customer base by that because our customers are smart and they move quickly. And so that's occurred. Now we're going through the transition with more customers, some of which who are doing it and causing us, if you will, eliminating some of their overage cost, but some of those customers who are buying up into a little bit of a bigger package just don't have to worry about overages. So that conversion is well through, and we'd expect to see that complete over the next year or so. So from a revenue perspective on a longer-term basis, we feel good. On the wireless side on the expense piece of it, we still have a significant opportunity. From an overall perspective, we have about 40% of our network functions virtualized, both wireless and wireline. You've seen what's happened and the progress we've made in just getting from 34% to 40%, and we'd expect to get that to 55% by the end of this year and 75% or better by the time we complete. So there's more opportunity with that as well as automation, digitization. Quite frankly then, as you put all that together, from a total company perspective, our data insights opportunity, our advertising opportunities are significant. And quite frankly, as you saw this quarter, our international operations were getting through the investment cycle. It's gone as we expected. They're particularly in Mexico adding a great number of customers, but across Latin America also. So we're doing well. We just need to get through that process, and those are the opportunities to see costs be managed very well and margins continue to grow. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks very much for the incremental color. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just a quick comment on the phone adds \u2013 phone losses rather on the postpaid side, a bit better than we were expecting there. But I was just thinking about the feature phone base generally. Is there a level at which you think the pressures will start to subside in a much more meaningful way and we can drive towards positive phone adds? And then maybe just a quick comment on the DIRECTV sub weakness you're seeing there. Obviously, you called out a few things. Where are those customers going? It seems like there's an investment in time and everything else to have the satellite put on the roof. Are these cord cutters, or are they moving to a cable offering? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So let me take the first. First of all, Mike, and I don't want to be stirring turf (28:56) here, but AT&T added contract phone customers for the quarter because our postpaid phone adds in Mexico were positive 100,000 or more. And when you put those together with our domestic base, we were actually positive postpaid phone customers, just to clarify. On the domestic side, we did see significant improvement sequentially and year over year, over about 250,000 improvement sequentially and about 100,000 improvement in customer count year over year. And really we're seeing that from bundling of services and being able to put this video and other services together with it. So it's working well. As everyone knows, you saw it in the churn numbers. And the best customer is the one you've already got and the one you can hang on to, and that's the most efficient. With regard to feature phones, we are well through the process. I monitor, if you will, the percentage which is in the mid-90s of phones that we sell every quarter that are smartphones. And it's in that mid-90% range. And then I compare that to our base. And over the last few years, we made significant progress in getting those numbers aligned. So I think we are getting close to the point where we are through that migration. It's not complete, but I would tell you we made significant improvements over the last few years. Because of that, we retain or have optimism going forward on the ability to show some improving service revenues, and quite frankly, be able to continue to keep churn down because we have customers operating on smartphones and taking advantage of the quality service. So we feel good about that. And yes, I think, maybe not now, but maybe in the next year or so, we should see a feature phone level that is much more constant and have gotten through this migration. I relate it in a similar way to what we're seeing on the consumer side with DSL broadband, where you've seen we made great strides converting to IP broadband and are getting to a point where we're dramatically through that conversion, which is optimistic for all of us. On the sub weakness, as I said in the first quarter and will say again, we had a significant number, a higher number than normal, a higher number year over year of involuntary churn. And so we went through that process and decided to take action on those customers. That's one. Two, we are seeing on an out-of-footprint basis where we don't have fiber, we're seeing sub losses to competitors where they can bundle. We believe we're going to, if you will, arrest that or address that situation as we continue to build out fiber. And quite frankly, not only just the, if you will, 14 million or so fiber-to-the-prem locations we'll get to, but as we mentioned, as we develop 5G wireless technologies that allows for efficient delivery of video over our wireless networks, we'll be able to compete in that environment like no one else on a nationwide basis. Those are the two things I'd point out to you, Mike, on the sub weakness. I will point out we did have some good growth in DTV NOW, for the over-the-top product pretty much offset the DIRECTV satellite base wireless customers. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : And, John, just real quick on the NFL Sunday Ticket, obviously you're going to be coming up in the third quarter with NFL kicking off. Anything we can be expecting unique on the bundling with that particular product, whether it be with DIRECTV NOW or wireless or anything unique? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Nothing to announce today, Mike. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: It's a good question, but nothing to announce today, respectfully. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, John. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hey, Phil. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First to follow up quickly, of the DTV NOW customers, how many of those are bundled with other products that you sell versus standalone? And are you reporting just paying customers, or is it all on the platform? And then second on FirstNet, with states that are opting in now, when could you start rolling out that new spectrum? And can you talk about the offer to public safety customers in those states? How do those compare to consumer prices? What should we be thinking about in terms of adds coming on as those FirstNet offers start to hit? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So the DTV NOW customer rates we're giving is paying customers that bundle with in many cases a large, large percentage of it, top of the head. But we can make sure we get that out appropriately in a post. But the vast majority of those are bundled with our wireless services. But as you know too, it gives us the opportunity. A significant amount of these, 50% or so are customers who have never had a paying video product before or haven't had a pay-TV product, so we're getting the opportunity to not only provide them video but provide them wireless, in some cases broadband, apartment dwellers and others. But we're counting paying customers, not promo customers. Secondly, we will have the capability to roll out the spectrum once the states opt in. The challenge will be to get the plans finalized and to incorporate the final agreements with the states on coverage and towers and build-out and some of the negotiated terms and make sure we have effective plans for those. But I would certainly expect that we will have the ability to start rolling out spectrum this year. Until the plans are complete, I don't want to predict what we'll have rolled out or how much. We'll certainly do that as soon as we're confident of it, but we'd expect to do that right away. Secondly, I think the offers will be attractively priced because there will be large numbers of devices, not only phones but cameras and other connected devices that add the ability for us to get good economics on good price points for fire departments, EMTs, police departments, and so forth. But as much as that is very important to us, the opportunity to then utilize this as a footprint or a starting point to get into smart cities, to be able to help these state, local municipal governments manage other parts of their activities are really important and provide us a great opportunity, as well as just the fact that the increased coverage that may be required by FirstNet will provide us an increased opportunity to sell services to other customers, to provide other IoT services, or quite frankly, to reduce what might be minor amounts in the scheme of things but reduce whatever roaming costs we have left here on the domestic side. But I would expect the prices to be competitive, and certainly today's consumer prices qualify as such. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. John, maybe first a quick question on the fall-off on the video side. How far through the involuntary churn on the DIRECTV satellite side do you think we are? And then with DIRECTV NOW, given the enhancements, the new content and the DVR, do you think you can get to a point where, given those two issues, you can start to see a blended video sub growth at some point? That's number one. And then maybe longer term, you guys have talked about a number of initiatives on this call, the spectrum deployment around 5G and FirstNet, edge computing, 14 million customer locations. And I know that SDN plays a role in this, but you spent $22 billion in CapEx it looked like this year, last year. Can you do everything you're talking about doing within that budget, or should we expect spending to ramp as we exit the year? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: First and foremost, yes, I'd expect we can do it within those kinds of levels. I don't want to give guidance outside of this year, but I don't want to signal in any way, shape, or form any significant changes in CapEx. I certainly believe we can. I'll note to you that on the FirstNet side, there is a significant amount of efficiency that is achieved by doing this at once, all of the spectrum at once, all the tower climb, all the deployment and so forth. And then secondly, there's a significant co-pay from the FirstNet organization, $6.5 billion. So absolutely we're going to be in a position to do this. With regard to the video involuntary churn, I would expect we'll see some of this through the remainder of the year, and we would expect that it would to start to ebb as we go through the year. But I would expect we'd have some of it through the rest of the year. And certainly based on what the team has developed, what they've taken from customer insights and customer input, we believe that DTV NOW can certainly grow. And the cloud DVR and a lot of the other features that are coming out are in response to the studies the team has done with regard to what customers want and what would make the product better. And so absolutely, we've grown 500,000 customers in seven months. It's pretty dramatic growth, particularly when we gave a couple, three months rest there while we tested the platform and really put it through performance testing. So I think there's clearly a demand for it, an opportunity for it and for us that allows us to get to a lot of customers we don't normally serve today, MDUs, millennials, people who haven't bought or haven't been able to have the creditworthiness to buy our premium products. So for us, it's a really attractive next step. Into the future the data insights that we'll be able to get and the ability to add advertising and other sources of revenue off of this will make this profitable while still being able to give consumers great choice and great cost efficiency for them as well as a good product for us. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Hi, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Simon. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On FirstNet, have you finalized how the accounting is going to work? You talked about the $6.5 billion co-pay. So how should we think about it? Is this is going to be grossed-up CapEx, how the puts and takes? I think you made some reference to a working capital impact maybe around the turn of the year. And then there were some media stories about potential org structures after the closing of Time Warner. Maybe you could just address that. Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So let me just say this on the org structures. Randall Stephenson is still the Chairman and CEO of AT&T, and I expect him to do that for a long time. I don't expect any changes there before or after the Time Warner merger. With regards to the structure of the organization after Time Warner, I think Randall and Jeff Bewkes are going through that, working that process out. And I will definitely leave that to them I think to discuss. Oftentimes, stories are very premature. Those decisions are theirs, and we'll leave it at that. With regard to the FirstNet, what I expect that we would do is we would disclose the gross amount of CapEx we spend inclusive of FirstNet amounts, then show to the investment community the reimbursement amount that would be recorded \u2013 would be expected to be recorded as a, so to speak, contra-CapEx account or reducing the total amount because it's not a cash outflow. It will be a cash inflow to offset the expenses, the expenditures we made, but we would expect to get both of that. Some amount of that $6.5 billion will be allocated to expense, and that expense would go in the same way we would expect to disclose it, give full information about it, be transparent about it. And that would be, if you will, a contra-reduction in our expense lines. The customer count information and normal service revenues where we record like other customers, and then it's working out with regard to the accounting for the valuation of the licenses that we receive and the payments that we're required to make, the sustainability payments that we're required to make under the fund, and we're working through that. As you can imagine, this is a first of its kind public-private partnership, so we're working with our accounting firm to make sure we have clarity on that as we finalize numbers. We don't have those numbers finalized. We won't have those finalized until the state opt-in \u2013 or state and territory opt-in process is complete. So before that time, the actual numbers that we're going to be using will be still uncertain. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And did you mention some timing difference perhaps in the fourth quarter? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So what I'd expect at this time, for example, we want to build a cell site and put up equipment and it costs us $500 and it's reimbursable from the FirstNet fund. We may finish that in month 11 and send a bill in the normal course, just normal processing. We don't get paid for that bill until month one of the next year or month two of the next year. We don't know how that will work yet. We haven't been through that. FirstNet has been very cooperative. We're dealing with this. I'm just suggesting that those may not match up exactly. We just want to be transparent about that. I don't have any prediction that they won't, but just wanted to make sure that this is a case of first impression not only for AT&T but for the FirstNet administrators. So while we've got a great collaboration going on, it's not done yet, and so we want to be careful. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'll go ahead and stick with the FirstNet theme. So thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about the timing around starting to build out the network. With states already opting in and with you making your existing network available to the states, when can you actually start marketing the product and bring customers online? Essentially what has to happen between opt-in and going to market? And do you have any estimate for what the addressable market of incremental customers to your business could be over time? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So we can start selling into the states. We started making those sales calls right now into the states that have opted in, and they certainly have an organization that was already set up, already ready to run, so to speak, fully prepared to go in our Business Solutions organization, have a whole team ready to do that, and they've been working on it. So, if you will, those sales activities start now, and I will tell you the sales activities work with industry groups already. So that could involve already making contacts, meetings with sales pitches, maybe not specific proposals, but sales pitches to industry groups and departments across the country. So that's been a very active process. If you will, we haven't given out any specific numbers. I would tell you the opportunity is not only in the millions of potential customers out there with fire, police, safety, and other departments, but also quite frankly for all the related uses and whether we utilize this for a friends-and-family opportunity, whether we utilize this to sell smart cities, whether we utilize this to go in. and where we have an improved network coverage and speed situation because of FirstNet, we go back in and double down on our sales efforts into the existing marketplace. That's what this provides. Whether once we have a FirstNet build complete, what part of that build would be able to handle video. Does this extend our ability to do fixed-to-wireless local loop that we're already doing through the CAF II program and so on and so forth? So I'm not giving any specific guidance, but I would suggest to you that it is real and it is something that we are excited about, specifically with regard to the police, fire, EMT, what I think people would most think about when they think about first responders. Now we do not have a very large percentage of that market share. We certainly underserve it, just like years ago we underserved prepaid and we've had some great success with Cricket and AT&T Prepaid. Just like our DTV NOW product is getting us into being able to serve customers in the video space where we were very much underserved, FirstNet is going to provide a lot of opportunities for us, but one of them is to serve a market where today we are underrepresented and we believe we can do a great job for those folks. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just a quick follow-up question, are there any product bottlenecks? In other words, do you have devices you can offer now that support the new spectrum? Is that necessary? Or is this really as quickly as the opt-in states decide they want to go with you, you can start lighting people up? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yes, there are devices that are ready today, but there will be new devices. The team has been working with the manufacturers. We work in partnership with Motorola and others on developing new devices, new services, whether they be video-placed, camera location-based services, other, whether it be allowing for the devices to actually become report writers or, if you will, event reporting devices to allow the police officers to have more time on the street than back on the desk writing up reports, all of those things that we've been actively working on since the day we started this process, and we feel very optimistic about that. There are products today that we believe we can use to serve. There will be a whole lot more products, a whole lot more products and equipment out there as time goes on. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks for taking the question. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, a question on ARPU, it was a noisier than normal quarter with the full quarter effect of the unlimited plus whatever benefits you're getting from tailwinds there, seasonal forces, the EIP migration. But the net of it was it picked up, and we saw one of those last year in the second quarter. I was wondering if you can unpack the moving parts and what we should expect to see that number potentially do over the course of the year, given where we are. And then the second, if I could, just a housekeeping item. I think, John, you called out two things, taxes and Brazil, as giving some tailwinds in the quarter that weren't normalized. If you could elaborate on those, that would be great. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So thanks, David. On Brazil, with regard to it, there was a Supreme Court ruling on a value-added tax matter that was not our case, but it was a case that we also had in front of them. It provided about \u2013 right around $60 million worth of benefit to us in the quarter. It's an item that we had been accruing and depositing cash for while we disputed it. We now determined that we should win that case based of the Brazil Supreme Court ruling, and we booked that through the international LatAm results. We did not receive the cash for that. But it is an item we had been accruing for some time. And the, if you will, expense pressures have been going through, some in 2017, but certainly the vast majority in prior years. So that was that call-out. That is really the major item. But in a company where you file 250,000 tax returns and you operate all across the planet, you've always got tax disputes going on, and sometimes they go in your favor and sometimes they don't. That is what we were trying to say and make sure we were just straightforward. If you look at our effective tax rate on the income tax side, it's a little bit low, but it's all good work. All the things have been working. We just had a couple of things come together with regard to working some things out with the taxing authorities, but we were just trying to be transparent with that. David, with regard to ARPU, let me try to go about it this way. First and foremost, the shift last quarter to unlimited had an immediate impact of impacting our overage revenues because the folks most impacted by overage were the ones quickest to go into the unlimited. We've got smart customers. There were also some promotional activity impacts in both quarters. In this quarter, though, we're starting to see those immediate impacts slow down, and now we're starting to see we believe some of the customers, some of the customers buy up to have protection from overage charges. They may have been on a lower plan, but they now seem to want to buy up. Those are a couple of the moving parts. I will also tell you we are continuing to get further and further towards completion of the equipment installment plan process. I know we've been talking about that for three years now or more. But quite frankly, it isn't complete, but it's near complete, and so that completion helps us compared to the rest in the industry. On the other side, our things like our insurance rate and insurance claim \u2013 or insurance processes, we're participating in insurance programs, and some of the administrative charges have helped our ARPU as those things have improved or increased, so that side of it. On the rest of the service revenues, you'll see that we moved away from reseller, and you've seen that all year \u2013 all this year but last year on our reseller counts. We have moved away from that, and that is having a pressure on the overall service revenues. Likewise, we've been having gains in prepaid throughout last year and this year, and that's helping with regard to total service revenues outside the ARPU discussion. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions, just two, if I could. One on enterprise, particularly on the fixed side, you called out weakness in investment and some technology transitions. Just wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing on both the macro and competitive front. And then secondly on wireless upgrade rates, again you're at record lows. Maybe, John, just wondering if this is more of the new normal, or whether you're expecting maybe a bigger pickup later in the year given some pent-up demand? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. So on the upgrade rates, you're right. They were low. They've been low for the six months. For the full year, I would suggest to you, I would expect a pickup in the second half of the year as new devices come out. But I would tell you once \u2013 and quite frankly, the longer we get through the equipment installment plan cycle, the more we get back to a normal level where there are enough phones that are three, four \u2013 whatever the term might be \u2013 years old and need to be replaced, whereas in the first couple of years the phones were still new, and so customers weren't necessarily needing to do it. Quite frankly, the transparency to customers with regard to what these things cost is impacting their decision-making. It's made it their pocketbook decision. While we would expect those to pick up in the second half of the year, and on overall basis, I wouldn't be surprised next year if it picks up from where it is today. But we would not expect it to go back to pre-equipment installment plan levels. I just wouldn't expect that to happen. For the rest of the year, predictions on what the rate would be would be inappropriate. We don't know how customers are going to take to the new devices, the new offerings and so forth, so we'll wait and see how that will come out. I will tell you with regard to the new technology aspect, four-way carrier aggregation, the MIMO effect, some of the other things that we're doing with really upgrading our network and improving it, many of those can be taken advantage of with the new handsets. And so we are watching it carefully because we think those customers are going to have an even better experience with the investments we've been making on our network. With regard to enterprise, what we're seeing is a couple things. There are these annual contracts, whether they be Q3, some are a little bit longer. But as they come up for renewals, there's a step down in these traditional prices. So we've seen a lot of that with regard to voice. And so we're just taking it slow, and we're just going through that. That's one aspect of it. Two, we're able to compete. I don't see it as a losing to competition aspect, but it's just the new pricing levels. Three, we're seeing very little business fixed investment in this space that's generating demand for us or anyone else for that matter. And I think the government's GDP programs, it's why we're so strong on tax reform. It's why we continue to push for tax reform because we think that will generate that investment and help us generate revenue on the top line. Lastly, I will tell you that we continue to be very favorably received on the combination of our wireless and wireline at the business level, the ability to provide IoT devices and other wireless connections to employees, customers, engineers, HR departments, and so forth, to help them do their jobs, that we are doing what I consider to be just a very good job of continuing to fight the fight and keep customers happy, keep them in their relationship with us, and driving cost out at the same time to actually grow margins. But it's a tough enterprise environment and it's a tough legacy environment. And the team's doing really well to shift that to those Strategic Services into wireless. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Go ahead, please. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Maybe back to the bundle, can you talk about how adding content helps upsell your bundle, I guess specifically the HBO upsell that you started in April? And any early thoughts on what Time Warner brings, any proof points as to what content does for the bundle, and perhaps next steps to the deal and sticking points on conditions? Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: On the Time Warner deal, I won't talk about any sticking points to the transaction. We'll leave that for another day or to when we get it approved. I will make this comment with regard to \u2013 Time Warner has got great quality content. Everybody knows that. I think it's undisputed. And so that's going to be great for us to bundle with our products but also great for us to sell to others who may want to bundle their products. With regard to HBO, quite frankly, customers like it. Customers like the opportunity to have that with their phone. So we're just trying to provide what customers want. I would suggest to you \u2013 once again, I know this is simplistic, but the best proof we can give is the ability to look at that churn and see where that smartphone churn has gone, and knowing that a lot of that has to do particularly in this competitive environment. It's a very competitive environment, and why are people staying with us? I think in part it's because they like the ability to bundle, so we are seeing that quite well. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thank you. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Kathy, we'll take one more question. Operator : All right, thank you. That will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. It sounds like out of region you want to go with a quad-play wireless product, obviously with DIRECTV. Any sense how long this might take? I know you've done a couple 5G trials, or maybe even can use LTE out of region. I know you said basically half the DIRECTV customers were not paying for TV before. Do you have a sense of maybe what percentage of the customers that are with DIRECTV NOW that are wireless-only? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I don't know, so let me say this. You're hitting it right with the fact of the question of can we generally \u2013 I don't want to be on an absolute basis, but generally on a national basis, we use our wireless network starting with our LTE and LTE-LAA with carrier aggregation and so forth, can we provide a connection that would allow for sub (1:00:18) video transport? And we believe we can. The tests that we've done have shown that. Now those are just tests, they're trial markets, and we need to expand them. As you combine the FirstNet build with this, you get more opportunistic because you're going to be out in the network, and you can take advantage of that touches to do whatever else you need to do to improve those capabilities. Likewise, as we have talked about before, we are a big player in the CAF II funding, and are building a lot of that, and so there's a lot of other items to coordinate with FirstNet with our existing LTE network. We have the technology developments with, if you will, 5G Millimeter Wave, but yes, we can. So that is, if you will, our goal to take this 14 million fiber-to-the-prem type coverage and combine it with a 5G wireless to have extensive coverage across the marketplace and be able to provide not only great wireless, but video and other services, mobile broadband and so forth. Tim, if I could, I think this is near you. We just got word that New Jersey has now become the sixth state to opt in to the FirstNet. So we continue the momentum, and I wanted to point that out while we're on the call. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, congratulations. Maybe lastly on the expense front, it looks like the trends have gone a little better on expense management. And I think in the past, you guys have said when you get over 50% virtualization you can really start to see some of the expense benefits. Just maybe any color on your confidence \u2013 basically because it sounds like you're sounding more confident on the ability to \u2013 virtualization to really reduce expenses? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Tim, we are confident. I think it's a large part the technology, our network guys, as well as our business operations guys, but we are seeing it. It's already happening. The issue with regard to 50% for me, Tim, is the math exercise that we've got most of the investment dollars behind us to get it to 50%. So then we can see the compounding of the savings going forward because we've got so much already done, if you will, in the book, completed. And so it's easier to build on that, whereas today while the team's doing a really good job getting it up to 34% at the end of last year, they were reinvesting to get there, and they're reinvesting money this year to get to 50% \u2013 55% by the end of the year. So it is absorbing some of the cost efficiencies. It's well worth it, great investment. But once you get over that 50% level, it becomes more of a pure \u2013 the benefits will exceed any of that additional investment in a clearer picture. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, Kathy. John, do you want to make some closing comments? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Folks, I appreciate everybody's time, and I want to thank you personally for being on the call today, just a few comments before we go. It continues to be a highly competitive environment, but our cost containment efforts are paying off, and you've seen that in our margins and our earnings. The prudent management of our wireless business led to branded phone growth, record low postpaid churn, and best-ever EBITDA margins. We also posted solid year-over-year and sequential postpaid phone improvement, and we are really excited about the transformation of our broadband business and the inroads DTV is making as well as the developments in our international businesses. Our strategic moves with Time Warner and FirstNet along with these quality current assets, employees, and customers that we already have are separating ourselves from our competitors and positioning AT&T for the future, so we're very excited about what's yet to come. Lastly, one last thought before we go. As you make your way home tonight, please remember, no text is worth a life. It can wait. Thanks again for being on the call and thanks for your interest in AT&T and good night. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and choosing AT&T Executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T third quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to cover the third quarter results and then provide several business update. And we'll follow that with Q&A. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, our 8-K, investor briefing, associated schedules. Now before we begin, I'd like to call your attention our Safe Harbor statement. That's on slide 2. The Safe Harbor statement says some of the comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is always available on the Investor Relations website. And so with that, I now would like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. Our financial summary is on slide 3. Before we get to the results, this was an unprecedented quarter when it comes to natural disasters. Hurricanes pounded Texas and Florida and caused historic damage to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and earthquakes and storms devastated Mexico. Our hearts go out to all those that are impacted. Our team has coordinated with federal, state, and local officials to maintain and restore service throughout the impacted areas. I've heard some remarkable stories about the lengths our employees went to, not only to restore service, but also just to help others. Our legacy of service spans more than 140 years at this company, and it's being kept alive by dedicated employees dealing with situations like this. Senior management just wants to make a special thanks to all our employees for what they've done through these challenging times. Now turning to our results, we've once again included both a quarterly and a year-to-date view to give you a more complete perspective. We continue to track well against our full-year guidance, and we continue to invest for the growth of our business and remain focused and optimistic about our long-term opportunities. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, stable with last year and up more than 4% year to date. The adjustments include the impact of higher interest expense for the pre-funding of our Time Warner transaction and storm-related costs. Revenues continue to be pressured by slow equipment sales and what were legacy services. We've had about 2 million fewer phone upgrades so far this year when compared to a year ago. That has a big impact on revenue but also reduces expenses. But year to date, adjusted consolidated operating margins were up 80 basis points over last year and third quarter margins were stable year over year, thanks to record margins for Mobility and solid performance from our Business Solutions group. Cash flow also continues at a very strong pace. Cash from operations is up for both the quarter and year to date. That's helping us handle increased capital spending so far this year. Capital spending was $5.3 billion for the quarter and $16.5 billion year to date. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion in the quarter, or up more than 13% year over year. That's one of our highest quarters ever and provides ample support for our attractive dividend. It's even stronger when you consider the impact of FirstNet on free cash flow. Year to date, we've invested more than $200 million in FirstNet, with reimbursement for most of that to be received in the coming months. Now let's take a look at our operations, starting with Mobility. Those details are on slide 4. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company also is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Mobility turned in another great quarter, as we continue to execute efficiently and effectively while increasing the number of customers on mobile with video bundles. Margins continue to come in at record levels, helped in part by excellent cost management. We had our best-ever EBITDA margin of 42%, and service margin was also a record at 50.4%. Postpaid phone churn set another record for the third quarter at 0.84%, and we continue to add branded phones and increase our smartphone base. Revenue was impacted by fewer equipment sales. Customers are holding on to their phones longer, and others are bringing their own device, which shows our plans are providing customers the choices they want. Service revenue continues to be impacted by customers choosing unlimited plans and eliminating overage charges as well as some lower resale revenues. While it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day noise in the wireless marketplace, look at the bar charts where we show a two-year view of our Mobility operating statistics. During that time, our postpaid smartphone base is increasing, up by more than 1.5 million customers. And our prepaid phone base has the highest growth rate in the industry. We added 3.5 million new prepaid phone subscribers in the last two years. Branded smartphones are our most valuable customers, and we've increased that base by about 6 million in the last two years. We've also lowered churn in that time, setting record low postpaid phone churn levels quarter in and quarter out. As you take a look on the lower right where we show historical service revenue for the four largest carriers, we've not only held our own when it comes to industry service revenue share during the last two years, we've increased it. And we've been very successful in convincing our feature phone customers to move to higher ARPU smartphones. So in the last few years, as wireless companies have intensely battled for market share, we've grown our smartphone base, expanded margins to record levels, reduced churn, and grown our share of wireless industry service revenues. We're well positioned to compete and respond to customers' needs for the long term. Now let's move to our Entertainment Group. The results are on slide 5. You know the headlines of our Entertainment Group from our 8-K filed earlier this month. Revenues were slightly down. Growth in IP, video service, and advertising revenues offset most of the legacy voice declines. But margins were under pressure in the quarter. Increased content costs, promotional activity, and video platform expenses impacted results. Management's decision to tighten our credit policy and focus on overdue accounts impacted customer counts. That and the losses from severe storms explain nearly half of our traditional TV decline. While these efforts are impacting customer counts, these steps are the right long-term approach for the business. Even with these impacts, we expect a net addition to our total video customer base in the fourth quarter, with improvement coming from linear TV. While we continue to work to improve our linear video, we are very encouraged by the rapid deployment of our DTV NOW offering. We added nearly 300,000 DIRECTV NOW customers in the third quarter and have nearly 800,000 subscribers in total. That's incredible scale in less than a year of operation, and we expect that growth to continue. And most of those customers are new to our TV service, new to AT&T, about 700,000. We continue to evolve our video model at this time. We've kicked off our beta trial for the next-generation software platform. This will enhance ARPU and margins and include additional functionality, such as cloud DVR, additional streams, pay-per-view movies and events. We expect to launch this new platform widely in early 2018. We also have another revenue opportunity with targeted ads. We're very committed to building a data Insights business, which takes our scale and resources to give our customers and ourselves a very competitive targeted opportunity. In fact, we established a new organization and brought in Brian Lesser, one of the top minds in the advertising business, to help us build this business. And DIRECTV NOW is only getting better. We've added live local channels in more than 75 markets, with more than 30% of the country now receiving all four of the major networks. And customer acquisition costs are a fraction of a traditional TV gross add. And while we increase our capabilities and ad reach even more, there will be some twists and turns along the way in this evolution, but we're confident in the direction we're heading. At the same time, consistent with the original DTV merger plan, we're having success with our integrated offers. Our sales channels are great at coordinating bundled sales. Despite traditional video losses, we grew both the number of TV-and-wireless and TV-and-broadband customers. The number of TV-and-wireless bundles have grown by 20% since the DTV deal closed. Those 6.5 million video customers represent more than 20 million of our wireless postpaid subs. We only have about a quarter of the video base in these bundles, so we see considerable opportunity in our future. And that is significant because the churn rate of our DIRECTV homes who also have wireless is nearly half that of the standalone satellite subscribers, and it's about 30% lower when we bundle with IP broadband. And as you've seen previously, this is impacting our record low wireless postpaid phone churn as well. We also had another solid quarter of broadband growth. Total broadband subscribers grew for the fourth straight quarter. We also added 125,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter and nearly 600,000 in the last year. Even more exciting are our plans to step up our high-speed Internet deployment and reach more than 50 million customer locations with competitive broadband speeds over the next few years. This includes our previously announced plan to reach 14 million customer locations with fiber-to-the-prem, our existing VDSL footprint, where we offer speeds of at least 50 megabits or higher, and the existing 8 million businesses who are either using or within 1,000 feet of existing fiber capabilities. But it also includes a planned high-speed 5G deployment on a national basis, capitalizing on our dense fiber footprint across the country. This will make us one of the country's largest, if not the largest, high-speed Internet service provider, with more than half of those locations seeing near-gigabit speeds and strengthening our nationwide wireless and video bundles even more. We're seeing the impact of faster Internet speeds already. Penetration rates in markets where we have offered fiber for more than 24 months are approaching 50%, so we see a healthy growth opportunity developing there. Now, let's look at Business Solutions results on slide six. Structural changes in the Business Solutions segment are impacting results, as we continue to make gains in margins even as we deal with legacy revenue pressures. Wireline revenues were down, as gains in strategic services helped offset some of the declines in legacy voice. Lower equipment revenues also pressured results. But we continue to drive hard on cost management initiatives while increasing the percent of revenues that come from wireless, and those two things together are driving higher margins. EBITDA for the quarter was stable at $6.8 billion, with EBITDA margin improving by 150 basis points. Our move to software-defined networking is making an incredible difference with our cost efforts. About 45% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of the third quarter, and we're on track to reach 55% by the end of this year, with a longer-term goal of 75% or more. Moving to our international business at the bottom of slide 6, we saw solid growth across our operations. Revenues were up nearly 12%, as both Latin America and Mexico showed gains. EBITDA did decline year over year, due primarily to additional customer acquisition expenses in Mexico and foreign exchange impacts in our DTV Latin America operations. In Mexico, revenue grew both sequentially and year over year. Revenues were up almost 27% year over year. We continue to add subscribers in Mexico, about 700,000 new customers in the quarter, with a total approaching 14 million customers in service. We were able to accomplish this at a very difficult time for Mexico. The earthquake devastated parts of the country and some of our operations. We do expect fourth quarter sales to be strong and so forth to pressure \u2013 have some impact on margins. But we also expect to turn the corner with positive EBITDA in the next few quarters. At the same time, our Latin American satellite operations continue to be profitable. Revenues were up about 5%. Revenues were up more than 12% if you back out the impact of foreign exchange. Let's now move to our business update on slide 7. First, we continue to expect to close the Time Warner deal by the end of the year. Brazil regulatory authorities have approved the deal, with approval from the Department of Justice the last step. The financing is set, and we're ready to close once we receive DOJ approval. And once the deal closes, we plan to file pro forma financial statements. These will include detail on intangible amortization, deferred production cost, and the impact of inter-segment eliminations. In the meantime, Time Warner continues to perform well, even better than our expectation. That's a tribute to Time Warner's management team and the quality of that overall company. Next, the FirstNet opt-in process is underway. We've had a tremendous response so far. Already, 27 states and territories have opted in, and we are just a month into the 90-day opt-in window. The deadline for opting in is December 28. States that don't take action by that time will be automatically opted in. We expect to hit the ground running and issue work orders in January after the opt-in period closes. We've already committed more than $200 million in capital to the project in preparation for its start. Third, in anticipation of the Time Warner deal closing, we have reorganized our business. We're streamlining our corporate functions and pushing costs directly to the business units to drive efficiencies and respond more quickly to customers' needs. And we've established a new advertising and analytics organization to enhance our overall business opportunities. We also continue to review our portfolio of assets. We're always evaluating opportunities to monetize non-core assets such as real estate. We continue to have great optionality with our international portfolio and has been our practice for years. We manage our spectrum portfolio, adding to and divesting when the right opportunities develop. The recent storms showed how well our network performs in challenging situations and bodes well for FirstNet. Our employees made heroic efforts to get cell towers operating virtually overnight, clear central offices, and restore services to literally millions of people. We've been through a lot of challenges, but I've never seen our teams work as hard to maintain and restore our vital services for our customers. And while much of the media attention was focused on the U.S. mainland, the damage caused by hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was unprecedented, and so was our response. Recovery is progressing, with additional equipment arriving daily. We are seeing traffic grow daily on our network as service is restored. We currently have wireless services to about two-thirds of our customers in Puerto Rico and 93% of our customers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with daily call volumes now nearing three-fourths of the level of pre-storm activity. We're doing whatever it takes to reconnect customers; working with authorities, competitors, and even new experimental ways of providing service. It's still a long road ahead for the people of Puerto Rico, but we plan to be there every step of the way. Sometimes an opportunity comes from difficult events, and that is how we are seeing our rebuilding efforts. This will be an opportunity to review our build plans and potentially replace older infrastructure with the latest technology. This will provide a more resilient network with more speed and capabilities for customers. Moving to regulatory and tax reform, as you know, we're always keeping an eye on what's happening in Washington. We see a change in the mindset across DC in promoting lighter-touch regulation and pro-growth initiatives. We think this is incredibly positive for our country and could catalyze the economic growth we're looking for and the country desperately needs. The regulatory authorities have led the way with several positive moves. Controversial rules around business data services and set-top box regulations are off the table in support of the repeal of data privacy rules that apply only to ISPs and not other Internet companies. And there are hopeful signs that the FCC is going to reverse its controversial decision to extend the 83-year-old Title II regime to broadband services. At the same time, we continue to be strong advocates for tax reform. The United States is not competitive with the world when it comes to the tax rate American companies pay, which is encouraging the placement of investment and jobs outside the U.S. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to level the playing field for American workers and the businesses that employ them. If we can get this right, we not only help U.S. businesses compete globally, but it will drive greater investment and job creation here at home. It should shift investment to the U.S. and help generate revenue growth for U.S. service providers. This is the key to driving greater productivity and GDP growth. Tax reform is the catalyst we need to spur investment. AT&T already invests more in the United States than any other public company, but we're ready to invest even more if tax reform becomes law. This is an opportunity that we can't let slip through our fingers. Recent developments are very encouraging, and we'll continue to work with Congress on this as well as add our voice to the business community supporting tax reform. Now before we go to your questions, let's look at a quick recap of the quarter on slide 8. Obviously, it was another full quarter for AT&T. We have a lot going on in our business, but we are on track with all of our full-year guidance. Adjusted earnings and operating margins were stable, even as we dealt with pressures from legacy services and the Entertainment group. Cash flow continued at robust levels, including nearly 13% year-over-year growth in third quarter free cash flow. And our team is doing an incredible job handling the impact from natural disasters. Our Mobility group continues to turn in record EBITDA margins and the lowest-ever phone churn while growing our postpaid smartphone and branded phone base. And at the same time, our broadband business is showing growing momentum, and we're on track to deploy one of the largest high-speed Internet footprints in the country. The video model is evolving, and we are very encouraged by the rapid deployment of our DTV NOW product. Our bundling strategy is working and gives us a unique value-creating opportunity. Our continued success with targeted data analytics and advertising is another positive sign. And with the closing of our Time Warner deal, we will gain significant scale in that business to build out new and innovative platforms and services. And we are very pleased with the momentum the FirstNet process is showing. We look forward to completing the state opt-in process at the end of this year. We have a lot of work to do as we close this year and prepare for 2018. There are always challenges in our business, but we remain optimistic not only for the future, but also very confident that we will get this job done. With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&A. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, Kathy, we are ready to take the first question. Operator : All right, thank you. Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead, please. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks, a couple of questions on the wireless market. First, John, service revenues have been accelerating \u2013 or the decline has been accelerating for the last couple of quarters, but the sub trends have improved a bit. Can you talk a little bit about whether we should expect to see that line stabilize \u2013 the service revenues that is? And then talk a little bit about the competitive environment here in wireless as we head into the iPhone X launch. Do you think that's going to drive volumes and drive more promotions? Just what you're seeing in the market would be great. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So, John, let me take the first question. First of all when we came out with Unlimited \u2013 when Unlimited came out in the plans, we've got really smart customers, very direct, very simply we have real smart customers. Those that had overages quickly went to the Unlimited, and that's what generated some of the service revenue pressure. It's also generated high satisfaction and low churn, but it did generate some of the service revenue pressure. What we're also expecting is that some of the customers on some less expensive bucketed plans will buy up to the Unlimited plans and generate some revenue increases for those customers for us. That will come over time as data usage increases, as the capabilities of our network continue to improve and as well as customers use them. So we would expect that step-up and customer count step-ups to help service revenues going forward. Secondly, as you've seen in our reseller business, we have chosen not to pursue some reseller accounts and to make sure we kept capacity available for our business. It was a better use of it for our smartphone customers than for reseller customers. And so we saw some pressure this year from reseller revenues. We'd expect that to ebb as we go into 2018 and improve. So from both those perspectives, there's some optimism on service revenues and changing in that trend. With regard to the competitive environment, so far we've seen some rational activity through the iPhone 8 launch and most recently the activities that are going on, so we're optimistic. We're certainly ready. And as you can see, our margins are very solid and the performance has been great. But we believe we can compete and win based on our product offerings and that promotional activity of an extensive nature is not necessary. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Got it, great. Thanks, guys. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, John. Thanks. I wonder if we can talk about the video strategy. First, I guess the comment that traditional TV will improve in the fourth quarter, is that from typical seasonality, or do you plan to promote even more aggressively? Because it seems like you guys have been pretty aggressive for the last few months. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So based on what we see in the marketplace, what our marketing studies tell us, it's also based on getting through the losses. About half the losses, or just under half the losses this quarter were from involuntary churn because we tightened our credit policies. They were from the storms and the customers that we lost because of the storms that we just did not \u2013 that we took off the rolls, because those houses were gone and so forth. And also because on the gross add basis, when we tightened credit policy, we shifted some of those gross adds towards DTV NOW as opposed to the linear. We see those impacts easing in the fourth quarter, as we also see some opportunities to grow the net add numbers \u2013 or improve, I should say, the net add numbers. I wouldn't suggest it's from a significant change or movement in our competitive process or offerings or promotions. It's just what we are seeing in the marketplace. As I say, one of the key things is that the unusual or high nature of this quarter's losses had to do with some management decisions with regard to credit metrics and cleaning up some involuntary churn matters. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then if I can follow up, maybe the DIRECTV NOW side, how many of the new customers came in on that $10 add-in? I was surprised that 700,000 of those customers are new to AT&T. And so that would indicate that it didn't impact churn that much. So has this been more of a gross add engine than a retention engine? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: It has been more of a gross add engine, more than \u2013 I don't think we're giving out details, but I'll say this. More than half of those customers, for example, are not bundled with our wireless service. That's a real opportunity for us going forward, but they're not as of today. And I think 700,000 of the 800,000 are new, what I would call new to AT&T, so this is definitely that opportunity. We think as we look at it, of the customers that we have coming in, about half of them come from our competitors, switching off a paid TV service from our competitors. The other half \u2013 10% or so come from ourselves, migrating from one of our services, U-verse or DTV. But the rest of it are cord-nevers or the MDU news (30:29), just a variety of opportunities that we had not previously tapped into. I would suggest to you, though, going forward, we may more assertively utilize this for calls into our call centers for the full DTV. For those customers of a certain credit quality, we might look to push them or move them towards DTV NOW, just like we've done in the past with our successful offering of prepay, where we've looked to make sure that we have value-conscious customer offerings in both wireless on the prepaid side and in the DTV NOW offering on the video side. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, so you're seeing customers call up for existing DTV customers and moving to NOW, but that's only about 10% of NOW. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Not extensively. You're right, what you just said is right generally. 10% of those customers we don't think of as a significant level at this current time. But yes, it was about 10% or so. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. John, I wonder if we can continue on discussing the video business a bit. If we think about the margin pressure we've seen on a year-over-year basis, one would assume that's due to some of the traditional video offers that you mentioned, and also the transition increasingly to an OTT-centric business model. How should we think about the margin trajectory for the business going forward? You had mentioned that there are some new service launches going forward, the opportunity set around advertising, so I would love to hear your thoughts around that. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So on a long-term basis, when we come out with the new platform early in 2018, think about the opportunity on DTV NOW to get pay-per-view events, whether they be movies or some of the other events that are out there. Think about being able to provide features like cloud DVR, additional streams. And with all those opportunities go additional opportunities to raise revenues, and revenues that customers would be willing to pay for and improve the quality of the service. That gives us \u2013 that's how we're thinking about it long term. In addition, the ability to get the data insights, to learn about what customers are watching, what's necessary, will help us put together new packages and packages more directed towards what customers -we think that will help us take market share and also help improve the financial results as we structure those packages. And then third, all those data insights, whether it's information we take to improve our own marketing, we have a large marketing budget here. And if we could take that data insight and get that information and make it more effective, that's a huge opportunity for us for a company of our size, as well as selling digital ad insertion and doing digital advertising on the DTV NOW platform in selected situations. We believe that that is an opportunity. So those are all the things that we look to as we, more importantly, build this platform and get the volume base of this platform up as we approach \u2013 approaching 1 million customers here, as we close out the quarter 800,000, and then building on that and having the scale to effectively do these other things. That's how we're thinking about it on a long-term basis. I will tell you the quarter \u2013 your comment, Amir, on the video losses did affect the margins for the quarter is correct. The NFL coming out on a sequential basis, this being the NFL season, affects them. But I can also tell you we continue to spend money on platforms and improvement of the DTV NOW as well as our other activities. And so that as well as promotional activities also had an impact on margins, just to complete that story. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful, and then one question on the mobile side of the business. If we look at your year-over-year declines in phone-only net adds are easing, how should we think about the prospects for returning to growth, particularly as your smartphone base continues to expand? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So on postpaid, we're growing customer base. If you look at postpaid phones, if you take out the feature phone losses, we're essentially at flat or slight growth. So if you think about it from that way, we believe that we are getting to that turning point when you \u2013 the reason for the slide that shows that 92% of our phones are smartphones comes down to the fact that our flow share on smartphones versus feature phones is about 95%. That differential used to be about 10 percentage points or 1,000 basis points. It's down to about 300 or 3%, so we're getting to that point. That leaves us \u2013 provides us great optimism about the health of the business and about moving it forward. And when you put on top of that the margins we're seeing, we're really encouraged. The bundling strategy, the video bundling with DTV is working, and we'll continue to use good judgment in providing customers what they want. But that's how I think about the mobile business. It's really quite stunning results when you think about EBITDA margins, EBITDA service margins, churn. It's really quite encouraging. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much for the incremental color. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, good afternoon. John, can you talk a little bit about 5G in more detail? You've got a number of trials going on. It looks like you're basically committing to a nationwide rollout here. So how are the trial results going, and how should we think about the shape of your deployment 2018, 2019, and 2020? It looks like you're increasing your locations, the high-speed locations 20 million, 8 million of those come from fiber. The balance of 12 million is I guess a mix of some of the things you describe, but it seems like 5G is going to be a big part of that. So talk us through what we've seen so far that gives you the confidence. And then what's the shape of that and the investment over the next couple of years? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So we've done a couple of test overlays \u2013 more than a couple, a large number. We used LTE-LAA and other capabilities in our network out in San Francisco and got 750-meg speeds on the tests we did out there. Even if you take 10% of that to be normal fully loaded network speeds, you'd still have 75-meg speeds. We think that's pretty tremendous. We did a testing in Austin too, one in the same base where we combined carrier aggregation, MIMO, I think we used LTE-LAA there. And when we did that, we had phenomenal speeds, even I think as good if not better than we had in San Francisco. In addition, we did a millimeter wave, 28-gig millimeter wave test there and got a point-to-point test over 1-gig speed. So all of these things are things that the network team has already done, they've already been successful with. Based on the tests that we ran in Austin and San Francisco, we're deploying out to 20 cities right now. We hope to have them done by the end of the year, near the end of the year. These capabilities with carrier aggregation, LTE-LAA, and MIMO capabilities, and with those we are optimistic that we're going to get flow-through speeds that could cap 400 megs even by the end of the year and with that, on a fully loaded market, use a lower percentage. But those things are going on now. When you take those plans out a few years, we have a plan to hit the largest 30 cities with that capability. That 5G capability will overlap some of the, if you will, IP fiber-based services we have. So we didn't want to double count, so those numbers are overlapping, but it will be very great. When you talk about 5G from a millimeter wave perspective, we expect to continue testing that as we have in Austin and other places. I think everyone is aware we've got a transaction waiting for approval in front of the FCC on the significant holdings of a 39-gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum. We're moving forward on that. We expect the standards to be out in 2019 and equipment to be out. Following that, that is one that we will be one of the leaders on, and it will be in addition or in connection with the cities build-out that I just described. So I hope that gives you a sense of why we're so comfortable with putting that in greater than 50 million locations. Some of them will be served with both wireless or fiber-to-the-prem or fiber-to-the-business. But we are confident that in total, counting each of the locations only once, we'll have over 50 million. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And so you have you proved out the business model on the millimeter wave yet, or is that still something you still need to work through? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I'll say it this way. I think we proved out the business model that businesses need speed and capacity. That's been proven out. We need to do more specifically with the 39-gigahertz build-out. But from what we've learned in our Austin trial, we're optimistic that it will work out. Now remember, we have extensive fiber throughout the country, not only in our local exchange, our traditional service areas, where we have extensive fiber, fiber into neighborhoods, fiber nodes, fiber to businesses. But even on a national footprint, we have extensive fiber because of our legacy companies. And so we have a unique benefit compared to many others as we build out a wireless IP capability. Others do not have the ability to rely on the built-in fiber holdings that we have, and I think that's a unique advantage. We will continue to modify and adjust the build plans and the product offerings as customers direct us, but we're confident we're going to be able to do this in a very profitable way. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC : Good afternoon, it's James Ratcliffe for Vijay., two if I could. First of all on targeted advertising, I understand in theory how you would target ads in the platforms you control. Can you talk about what the opportunity to target ads or improve CPMs is on the portion of TWX viewing that doesn't come over DIRECTV platforms? And secondly, any thoughts regarding potential consolidation in the satellite business, now that you're fully into DIRECTV? It seems like the DIRECTV satellite business is likely to be shrinking over time. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: No comment on the satellite business. With regard to the advertising opportunity set, let me say this. With the data insights we have off of our satellite-delivered video, off our wireline or IP video, off our wireless-delivered content, and over our broadband networks, we have extensive data. We can now marry that with a data insights business capability that we've been building over four years, a big data company. We're now hiring those quality resources under Brian Lesser to get the quality and the talent that knows this business and takes this business and develops the products and services that we'll be able to first, quite frankly, use internally. We are a very large advertiser, if not the largest in the United States. And so the efficiency opportunity of taking this new information and using it effectively is enormous inside our four walls. But secondly, that also helps us with marketing activities. It helps us with efficiency in choosing content, making content choices, even marketing our programs, our films and so forth, because we have that knowledge. That's all internal and that's a very big deal. But if you think about the ad impressions that come over with Time Warner and add those to the impressions that we have on our network, they are literally, literally in the billions. If you want a proof point insight that's out there, you can just look at our advertising business, and it's growing in double digits. And that's from the initial use here of addressable advertising focus with some additional data. I'd suggest to you that's, if you will, the best way to think about it and the way to analyze it. If we could get those kinds of advertising revenues that we are getting on the DTV and U-verse IP platform growth on the Time Warner business, that would be very, very good. And that's just if we can, but I'm not going to give you specific targeted numbers. But I would suggest to you the indications are that this can be effective based on what we've seen in our Ad Tech business and our Entertainment group on the advertising side. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC : Great, thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, a couple follow-up questions around the broadband strategy that you outlined. I'll go slow here. You're talking about getting to delivering competitive speeds to 50 million customer locations. How many customer locations do you currently deliver those types of competitive speeds to? So in other words, how much do you think you're expanding your addressable market through the project? And then just along with that, can you break that down at all between in-footprint versus out-of-footprint? I've got to imagine some of that is outside your traditional footprint. And then the last part of it would be you have to do 12.5 million fiber locations. Is that where you're going to stop, or do you think of that 50 million, maybe more than 12.5 million will ultimately be served by fiber? Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Brett. Let me try to answer this as directly as possible. First of all, we're going to do the 12.5 million because we committed to do that and we're on track and we're ahead of that schedule. Secondly, because of the way the 12.5 million is counted \u2013 and there are some limits on greenfield build, there are some limits on overbuild of existing capabilities and so on and so forth, I'd suggest when we're done with that we're going to be closer to 14 million. And I'm using that as a rounded number, but let's call it 14 million on that fiber-to-the-prem. Secondly, we're right now at about 8 million business customer locations, business locations that either have fiber that's active in their buildings or within the industry-standard 1,000 feet where it's very effective to just go in and connect them. So that takes it up to 22 million. We have a VDSL footprint that serves at over 50 megs \u2013 or 50 megs, I should say, or better. Today, that's about 20 million. So those are the pieces. The additional pieces will be covered by 5G, and we're not going any higher than that. To back up though and start, right now we're at 6 million I think with fiber-to-the-prem. We're at 8 million with business fiber. With business, that's 14 million. We're at 20 million with VDSL. That's 34 million. And we're not claiming today to be any 5G on the wireless, although we have some builds that have been effective in that area, as I described earlier. That's the starting point. The additions, as I mentioned, will get up to 14 million with 8 million. The 20 million may change on the VDSL because we may upgrade it with fiber. We may do other things with it. So we'll see what happens with that. And then lastly is the 5G overbuild, which quite frankly might cover much of those same locations but won't be counted twice. We're only counting additional coverage. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And what's the timeline you think it's going to take to get to the 50 million, including all of those techniques? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I think we put in there that it would be around 2020 or thereafter, and I feel real comfortable about saying that's the way it's described on that on the slide. I feel very comfortable. The team is working very hard. The thing everybody's got to remember that one of keys to all of this is we're going to be out on our network doing FirstNet work. We've got 27 states and territories that have already opted in. We're 27-for-27 so far, and so we're going to have this opportunity \u2013 requirements to build out the 12.5 million, requirements to build out for FirstNet, but the opportunity to coordinate those builds and do it very effectively at the same time. So we're pretty optimistic with it, not to mention I'm optimistic because of the $6.5 billion contribution we get from FirstNet to fund this build. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we now have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could. John, just a higher-level question, I think a lot of people who watched your go-to-market evolution over the course of the summer and are looking at these results here would say that it appears that you've been willing to make an investment on the entertainment and video side, perhaps at a loss, in order to try to create a gain on the wireless side in terms of improved postpaid phone net adds, margin, churn, et cetera. And I guess if that's accurate, I'm wondering if you could grade yourself. How happy are you now with what you've achieved? And then is this the strategy that you want to keep doing at the rate at which you're doing it on a go-forward basis, thinking ahead to Time Warner? And then the second question would be Business Services obviously is down year over year. But if you look first quarter to second quarter to third quarter, it's actually been pretty stable across the fixed line side of the house. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about if we've found a plateau in that, or if we should see some drop-off as other forces are at work. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So let me take the last one first. We are starting to see some green shoots with regard to the pricing activity in-business. I'd suggest to you that there's more to come, but we are starting to see that. We continue to be optimistic about our product portfolio. We have a challenging business because we've got a lot of legacy voice and legacy analog data. But we continue to be convicted with regard to \u2013 and convinced that our IP-based products and services are a good long-term strategy. And as you point out, we are seeing some improvement in the pricing area. That's one. With regard to our strategy, we are in a bundled strategy. We are not in a strategy to trade one business off against the other. What we are in a strategy to do is to utilize all of our assets to benefit our customers and grow our business. And so bundling of wireless and video, bundling of broadband and video, bundling of broadband, wireless, and video is definitely the strategy. We definitely believe that works, and we definitely believe that can add value for the overall customer base, shareholders and customers alike. So that is what we're doing. And we'll continue to believe in that. We think it's the right strategy and we think it's working for us. I don't want to suggest, David, that there are any trade-offs or there are any views in that in the sense that we are looking at one business more favorably than the other. We look at the total value creation for the business and try to focus our minds on what the shareholders and the best long-term health of the business. And you know what, the strategy we established was the one we established when we closed the DTV merger. We expected, we hoped, and we planned that churn would improve, that broadband deployment would improve, that wireless would improve, and we're seeing all those things happen. So we feel good about that. With regard to this quarter's video, linear video losses, remember the point. About half those losses were a decision based on creditworthiness and credit policies and credit standards as well as some pain from natural disasters. We still believe those were the right decisions in the long-term interest of business, but those are different decisions than others would imply, and I want to make sure that's clear. David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : And, John, if I could, just a very quick follow-up, so just to be clear, so when you bundle a $10 DTV NOW package that maybe has, many estimate, $30 or slightly higher in terms of content cost, that $20 a month that you're investing to subsidize that DTV NOW product, you're seeing the financial returns on the wireless side. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Our wireless customers are really valuable in the extension of their life through the lowering of their churn, and the ability to get entire families or entire groups of phones is really important to us. And so we strongly believe that that is value-accretive to the total operations of the total organization, and we monitor it on a very regular basis. I will tell you, though, to make sure we have a \u2013 going back to a comment I think that Phil may have asked me about, and that is remember, these DTV NOW customers, much of them are new to us. And so not only do we have that new customer on the video side, but now we're going to get the opportunity to potentially get their wireless business and to potentially get their broadband business if we're in a position to do that. So we're very encouraged about that kind of opportunity that goes the other way, but we are convicted in the business proposition. David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Go ahead, please. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Thank you very much. Can you give us an idea of your longer-term trends on the prepaid and on the wireless side in wholesale? Where are you trending? You said you made the decision to step away from some the wholesale providers. Are you looking to back off on that? And how quickly can you redeploy some of the network assets for your own brands? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: The capacity is immediately re-deployable as it changes, so that's ongoing. With regard to the prepaid trends, we're continuing to see, as you saw, strong growth in our prepaid numbers. What we are seeing, for example \u2013 and we mentioned this in the 8-K with the reclass of our customer counts, if you think about it, we built this platform of a connected car. So we have millions and millions of connected cars out there, over 10 million connected cars out there. So we built this platform, and those are down in our Internet of Things in our connected device category. But now what we're finding is that 65% of the people who drive cars aren't our wireless customers, so we're finding a real opportunity to connect tens of thousands of those, almost 100,000 this quarter, with a prepaid offering to the connected car. And when they do that, they will pay us. It's not a $4 or $5, it's a $15 or $20 connection. And so it not only gives us a really great revenue opportunity and high margin, and that's a lot better than a resale opportunity at a much lower, but it's also an opportunity to show them what we can do and then potentially get the rest of their wireless business or get the rest of their video business. So that's how we're thinking about prepaid. It's not just the continued growth in the smartphones and the continued expansion of the base, as we've shown, 3.5 million customers in the last two years, pretty good numbers, but also in now building on these other platforms that we've built and use that as the opportunity, just like DTV NOW, to go out and see if we can make those customers a bundled or a complete customer of AT&T. And that's an opportunity that we're going to continue to pursue. That's a real value-creating and a win-win for the customer and for the shareholder. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, thank you very much. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Kathy, we've got time for one more question, and then John will have some closing remarks. Operator : All right, thank you. That will come from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for getting me in, just one on bundling. If you can, help us maybe first think through satellite video performance, how that differed inside and outside of your ILEC footprint. And then maybe more broadly, in order to better bundle with a broadband product outside your footprint, how do you think about accelerating efforts like your G.fast trials and 5G, which you talked about a little bit earlier, to maybe go to market with a broadband pipe beyond the ILEC footprint and potentially better bundle relative to maybe a video and wireless bundle? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Great. If I can, let me answer your question by just modifying it a little bit. It's not just inside or outside the footprint. It's really that ability, as you point out, as a standalone product, we have higher churn. As we pointed out in the slides, when we bundle satellite with wireless, the churn drops by 50%. When we bundle it with broadband, it drops by 30%. So either one of those, as you suggest, are very, very good strategies. From a wireless basis, we've got a national footprint, so the opportunity to do that is there. The need to continually improve speeds and throughput on the wireless network is there. But first, that gives us the solution to do that and some financial wherewithal to do that. So the network team is working very, very hard. That's why our finance guy can talk about the tests that they've already run in Austin and San Francisco and Indianapolis so easily because the network team has been on this. And that's exactly what they're thinking about. With regard to \u2013 and they'll do that across that national footprint. And then we will do inside. We believe that there's that opportunity to get these IP broadband speeds in that footprint, the 50 million build that we're talking, or 50 million potential or more really goes to exactly what you're talking about. So that is what we're trying. We're evaluating those builds on a regular basis. We're trying to balance capital needs and capacity capabilities as well as the desire to go out and build it once as opposed to build it with a tentative technology and then have to rip it out, as some would suggest, with regard to their claims to building out on millimeter wave even before standards are set. So it's balancing all of that. But you're right, that is what we're doing. That is our goal of enhancing speeds and coverage to more than 50 million locations. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. With that, folks, I want to thank you all again for being on the call today. In closing, we had a strong quarter, and our quarter and our year-to-date activities are on track to meet guidance. Our Wireless business is performing at record levels. Our DTV NOW offering is growing extremely rapidly. Almost 800,000 customers for a business that's less than a year old is pretty dramatic. We've got work to do and plans in place to improve our linear TV business. Our business solutions and our international continue to meet expectations and perform extremely well. And we're excited about the opportunity that our data insights ad tech business and Time Warner will provide. We continue to have strong cash flows, and we view that very positively, particularly as we have great coverage on our dividend. And as we go to that time of year, we want to make sure that we continue and we will be able to continue to provide our board the opportunity to continue raising our dividend if they so choose for the 34th consecutive year. We are positive about it, the future. We're optimistic. We've got to continue to work hard, but we believe strongly in what we're doing and our strategy. With that being said, we thank you for your time and look forward to working with you in the future. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. As Tony said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Randall is going to provide an overall business update and cover our 2018 business initiatives and John is going to cover results along with the 2018 outlook, and then will follow with our normal Q&A. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. It includes our news release, our 8-K, investor briefing, and a variety of associated schedules. Before I begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're going to be subject to risks, uncertainties, and results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And so now, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson. Randall Stephenson : Okay, thanks, Mike. What we'll do is start on page four of the deck. And I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure, 2017 was a remarkable year. It's remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate, and for AT&T. And it's been a long time since we've seen so many, what I would call, major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year. And we're calling these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It's going to be growth in U. S. investment and jobs and in wages. And all of this began early in 2017, as regulations across all industries were being rationalized. In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light touch regulation of the Internet. And this was the purchase that up until 2015, it allowed in the Internet to flourish in the U.S. tech sector to leave the world innovation. So, we obviously believe this is a step in the right direction, but this regulatory pendulum is going to keep swinging back-and-forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all Internet companies and to protect the consumer. We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the Internet and on customer privacy. So, we're calling for an Internet Bill of Rights and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses. Unquestionably, the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment, job creation, and wage growth. That lever was given U.S. companies a competitive tax system, one that levels playing field with the rest of the world. We're in very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases, and employee bonuses, and we were first out of the gate. We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 front-line employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion. So, while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid. And this was going to prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new level. What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It's designed and it's hardened for America's first responders and then that will be our foundation for broad 5G deployment. We're well underway with the build, including new sites in unserved or underserved rural parts of the country. We plan to deploy 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum that we've accumulated over the last for years along with the spectrum from FirstNet. And we'll also be deploying the millimeter wave spectrum from our FiberTower purchase and this is going to give us a quantum leap in both capacity and performance. We move to Mexico, I'm really pleased with how the team is executing. They're doing so well. We added 3 million customers in 2017. We also made great progress leading the industry in terms of software-defined networking, 55% of our network is now virtualized. And as a result, you're seeing our networking and our IT cost structure falling significantly. We also made progress moving our base of our high value customers into multiproduct bundles, saving them money; driving down churn, and earning more of their overall spend. And you can see the fruits of the strategy in our strong wireless performance this quarter in DIRECTV NOW's terrific first year in the market. Our fiber build continue to go strong. We know reach more than 7 million customer locations and expect to double that in the next 18 months. So, that's a look at 2017. And what I want to do now is move forward to 2018 and talk about our priorities this year and that's on slide five. It's no surprise our top priority for 2018 is closing our deal to acquire Time Warner. We were obviously surprised when the government decided to try and block the merger because it is a classic vertical merger between two companies that don't even compete with one another. With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions. Now, while we remain open to finding some reasonable solutions to address the government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be litigated in court. The trial date is set to begin March 19 and we remain very confident that we'll complete this merger. We're also going to be laser-focused in 2018 on building the world's premier gigabit network. And again, FirstNet, combined with our fiber and our 5G deployment, is giving us a powerful platform to accelerate our move into a gigabit world. And I got to tell you, I love our position here. We expect to be the first U.S. company to launch mobile 5G service by the end of this year and our fixed 5G trials were also going very well. We're learning a lot. We're gaining great insights into making this product a very strong commercial offering. And then, last week, the FCC issued an order that cleared the way for us to move forward with our acquisition of FiberTower and the vast majority of its millimeter wave spectrum licenses. It's what required for 5G. So, we get from FiberTower an average of nearly 360 megahertz of nationwide spectrum. And again, millimeter wave is critical for our 5G strategy and we'll be putting this spectrum to work later this year. In video, we're going to launch our next-generation platform this spring. This platform will add cloud DVR capabilities, it will give us a third stream to DIRECTV NOW, and it will have a lot of further enhancements to the user interface. Now, I've been using this thing recently and I got to tell you, I think our customers are really going to like this. The experience is very good. And so then before year end, we plan to launch in the next-gen product in a home centric configuration with a very thin hardware client. And just think about it this way, it's a very small, inexpensive streaming device plugged into your TV and then you connect it to any broadband service. There will be a voice controlled user interface with an integrated search feature and will allow you to search across any streaming video service that you subscribe to. So, it can be DIRECTV NOW, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, or even YouTube. It also gives you a premium live video experience in your home with the flexibility and ease-of-use what you would expect out of an OTT service. We're also ramping up our advertising and analytics business. This was being led by Brian Lesser, who joined us last quarter. I think he's one of the best minds in ad tech. We're really excited about this opportunity because advertisers have made it really clear to us that they're looking for a trusted option in premium video advertising, looking for an alternative to the current digital ad duopoly that can bring advertisers scale and deliver results that are transparent and brand safe. Once Time Warner closes, we'll be well-positioned to be that alternative. We think the entire industry, advertisers, publishers, and consumers, are more than ready for this alternative. And with Time Warner, we believe we'll have the right data, the right content and the right talent to build an automated advertising platform that can transform premium video and TV advertising. 2018, we're also going to be focused further on Mexico. Our business there is going to continue to scale. We continue to move towards profitability. We have great momentum in the market; nearly doubling our subscriber base in the last two plus years and our LTE build in Mexico is almost complete. And then, finally, our industry-leading cost structure is proving to be a significant competitive advantage. We obsess over delivering the lowest cost per megabyte in the world and we still have a lot of room to grow. So, that's kind of a synopsis of what we'll be focused on in 2018. What I'm going to do now is hand it off to John to give you a report on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. So, John? John Stephens : Thanks Randall and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide seven. The positive impact of tax reform led to some significant changes in both our reported fourth quarter and annual results. This impacted our balance sheet and fourth quarter earnings. It also led to us making some important decisions that impacted our fourth quarter cash flows. We'll walk through these impacts as we discuss the results. Revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as a strong quarter in wireless equipment and in our international operations mostly offset declines in legacy, wireless and video services. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were down year-over-year due to healthy increases in wireless sales and expenses from our Entertainment group, offsetting those solid growth in our international operations. And for the full year, operating margins were up 40 basis points. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.78, including a $0.13 positive impact from tax reform. Essentially, our ability to fully expense capital spending in the fourth quarter generated most of this benefit. Remember, tax reform expensing provisions were effective retroactively to September 27th, 2017. We also made a number of other decisions with regard to with tax reform in mind including the $200 million in bonus payments to our frontline employees, an $800 million funding of our employee and retiree medical trust, nearly $100 million funding of our AT&T charitable foundation, and a number of other steps. Adjustments for the fourth quarter include these special items; a $20 billion gain from our preliminary estimate of net deferred tax liability reductions generated by the new tax law, asset write-offs in our [Indiscernible] plant as our consumer fiber footprint continues to expand and we continue to serve new customers with those fiber capabilities, and additional storm and natural disaster impacts. And in the fourth quarter, those are primarily from Puerto Rico. Other adjustments include our annual mark-to-market pension plan re-measurement and merger and integration costs amortizations and some other adjustments. Free cash flow was up for the quarter and was $17.6 billion for the year, even with the $1 billion of benefit payments made in connection with tax reform. CapEx for the full year also came in on target at just under $22 billion. Let's now take a look at our operations starting with mobility, where the team turned in outstanding customer growth. Those details are on slide eight. AT&T's domestic mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and Customer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company's providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations and that's what I'll discuss today. First off, we added 329,000 postpaid phone customers in the quarter, a significant increase on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Postpaid smartphone net additions were even more at 400,000. Altogether, we had more than 2.7 million new subscribers with gains in postpaid, prepaid, and connected devices. And looking at the full year, we added more than 2 million of our most valuable branded smarts phone subscribers to our base. One big reason for the success is reduced churn. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at record levels, dropping to 0.89% in the quarter. Revenues were up in the quarter, thanks to strong smartphone sales. These sales also had an impact on margins. We had a year-over-year increase of 700,000 smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter as our customers kept coming back and getting new phones. Our BOGO offer was also successful and helped drive this volume increase. This growth impacted margins. But with record low postpaid phone churn, these customers will provide financial benefits years into the future. With these and many other efforts, we expect service revenues to improve throughout the coming year and turn positive for the year. We take a disciplined approach in building our customer base. We'll continue to be keenly focused on cost management, but also look for efficient opportunities to reinvest in our customers and continue growing. Now, let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results. Total video customers, IP broadband connections, and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW had a tremendous customer growth in its first year of operation. The 368,000 net adds in the fourth quarter gives us nearly 1.2 million customers in service, and we believe the best is yet to come. As Randall mentioned, we're close to launching our second-generation platform. We're excited about the improved customer experience the platform will bring and the newer opportunities that will come along with it. This will include the cloud-based DVR, an additional video stream to the two we offer today, and a more robust video-on-demand experience. You're also seeing us turn the corner with our Broadband business. IP broadband gains continue to be robust even as the conversion of DSL customers to IP slows the consumer DSL customer base dropped below 1 million. We added nearly 600, 000 IP broadband customers during 2017. Broadband penetration rate in our fiber footprint, where we have marketed our fiber service more than 24 months, are nearing 50%. Last year alone, we doubled the number of IP broadband subscribers in our fiber footprint. A big part of our subscriber success can be attributed to the integrated offers that we have. We continue to increase the number of bundled customers. The number of households, who take both video and wireless, increased by 160,000 in the quarter or about 700,000 more wireless customers who bundle with the video. That's significant because the churn rate of our DIRECTV customers who have our wireless service is nearly half that of standalone satellite subscribers. At the same time, we continue to work through the ongoing transition of the pay-TV industry. This transition pressures revenues and margins. We will manage this transition as we have managed other transitions over the year, but expect the pressure to continue throughout 2018. Now, let's look at Business Solutions results on slide nine. Wireless drove growth in our Business Solutions segment, but we also saw sequential improvement in our Wireline revenue trends. Wireless revenues were up 6% on the strength of smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially flat. Wireline revenues were down 3.5% year-over-year, an improvement over previous quarters and up nearly 1% sequentially. We now have 1.8 million business customer locations connected with fiber. That means more sales opportunities for the team. We also expect increased business activity following the passage of tax reform. Margins felt the impact of increased smartphone sales, but Wireline margins were up significantly to 37. 8%, something like 270 basis point increase, as we continue to drive hard on cost-management initiatives. A big part of these cost savings come from our move to a virtualized network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized by the end of 2017 and there's still more opportunity as we drive towards our goal of 75% of these functions virtualized by 2020. Our International business also turned in another strong quarter. Those results are on the bottom of slide nine. We had growth across our operations. Revenues were up 16% as both DIRECTV, Latin America, and Mexico showed strong revenue and subscriber gains. EBITDA also was up significantly, thanks to strength in Latin America and improvement in Mexico. Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. The 1.3 million net adds in the quarter pushed our full year growth to more than 3 million and our total subscriber base to more than 15 million. And our Latin American satellite operations added 139,000 customers, thanks to the strength in their prepaid products. The business continues to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow. Our business units turned in a great fourth quarter, but we also have done an excellent job managing our balance sheet during the quarter. Those highlights are on slide 10. We take pride in the disciplined management of our balance sheet. We see it as a competitive advantage and value generator for our shareholders. It's the foundation our company is built on and gives us the strength and flexibility we need to invest and to grow. That foundation became even stronger in 2017, thanks to tax reforms and thoughtful measures we undertook. First, we de-risked the existing debt portfolio by extending maturities, primarily beyond 10 years as we prepare to close the Time Warner deal. And we did it cost effectively without significantly increasing our interest rates. Our weighted average maturity is now 14.5 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. And we diversified our portfolio with about a quarter of the debt denominated in foreign currency. This gives us ample near-term liquidity to meet the demands on the business and provide solid, long-term returns to our shareholders. Second, our terrific cash flow generation enabled us to invest in growth, improve leverage ratios, and improve dividend coverage with a payout ratio of 68% in 2017. And with the passage of tax reform, we see a significant boost to our balance sheet, reducing $20 billion of liabilities and increasing shareholder equity by a like amount. This reform significantly improves our net debt to equity ratios as well as free cash flow and dividend coverage in future years. We also are in excellent shape with our pension plan. Our pension plan assets returned over 14% for the year, and we are nearly fully funded with no significant cash contributions required for at least five years. This is the case even with a historically low discount rate. If you apply the average five-year discount rate to our plan, it is essentially fully funded and at the average 10-year rate, it's actually overfunded. Coming from a strong position, we plan to increase our investment allocation to fixed income assets and lower our expected return on pension assets down to 7% from the current 7.75 assumption. All these measures have a profound impact on our financial position and I would expect the rating agencies will take notice and begin updating their models. It certainly has changed our outlook on capital budgeting, improving the returns of a whole range of products. As promised, we'll increase 2018 capital investments by $1 billion with tax reform. Even with that, we expect significant free cash flow growth in 2018 and going forward with our dividend payout ratio improving into the high 50% range this year. And we're committed to deleveraging after Time Warner closes with plans to return to historic levels by the end of 2020, if not before. Our management team has worked hard to build and maintain a strong balance sheet. We also know the job is never done. But 2018 brings tax reform, FirstNet and a new accounting standard that will affect our financial results. Let's talk about 2018 on slide 11. First, let's look at immediate impacts of changes in the tax law. Tax reform provides immediate benefits and its allowing the additional $1 billion in incremental investment in 2018, much of that targeted for fiber deployment. The lower tax rate is also expected to increase operating cash flow by about $3 billion this year compared to pretax reform expectations. We're also confident that as other businesses increase investments, there will be a potential uplift in demand for our services. We can't predict exactly when, so we didn't assume a significant increase in GDP trends in our guidance, but we are optimistic that it'll come and we'll be watching this closely. We expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be in a 23% range. The full year's impact of tax reform is expected to be about $0.45 of EPS health. FirstNet will have an impact on our 2018 financials. We plan to move quickly with the build-out and the timing of FirstNet reimbursements could impact our 2018 free cash flow. For example, we may have FirstNet-related expenditures this year that aren't reimbursed until 2019. We planned in net FirstNet reimbursements against the capital and operating expenditures to which they relate, so there'll be no revenue impact. We estimate that 80% of the reimbursements will offset capital expenditures with 20% offsetting operating expenses. We expect to expense sustainability payments as paid, net of any recoveries for FirstNet approved projects. We will see a $0.05 per share expense impacts from our sustainability payments and other operating expenses from our build-out in FirstNet operations. Additionally, we will see a $0.05 a share expense impact from increased interest expense in 2018. This comes from placing our AWS and WCS spectrum in service and no longer capitalizing the carrying cost related to owning in that spectrum. And we'll see a $0.04 a share expense increased from the lower expected return on pension assets that we previously discussed. In 2018, we will see a $0.06 a share benefit from reduced depreciation expense that we generated by the copper abandonment that we recorded in the fourth quarter 2017. And finally, the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have a positive impact on our near-term financials. Several items will be impacted, but the biggest of these are deferral pearl of commission expenses, which will increase profits in 2018; re-characterization of some service to equipment revenues for equipment that was provided with multiyear service contracts. This was expected to have an impact on Service revenues, but not a material impact on total revenues or on profitability; and a netting of universal service and other regulatory fees against the related expense. This is expected to significantly reduce both revenues and expense, but have little impact on profits. We still have work to do on revenue recognition, but our initial estimate is $0.10 to $0.15 per share of positive EPS impact in 2018. Our results will differ from others because of our extensive Next program as well as our adoption of deferred installment accounting contemporaneous with our 2015 acquisition of DTV. Look for more detail disclosures in the near future. The impacts of tax reform, FirstNet, copper plan abandonment, and rev rack are reflected in our 2018 outlook, and the details on our outlook are on slide 12. On a standalone basis, excluding Time Warner, we expect adjusted EPS in the $3.50 range as I said, inclusive of the items previously discussed. We also expect organic growth in the low single-digits, driven by continued profitability improvement in Mexico, Wireless service revenues growing in the second half of the year, cost structure benefits from virtualization and automation, and those offset by continued transformation of our video, business, and legacy services. Free cash flow growth will be strong. We're expecting about $21 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which approximates our expected adjusted net income. And we expect capital spending to approach $25 billion or about $23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements. That includes the $1 billion of incremental tax reform investment. That's it in a nutshell. We ended the year with an exclamation point, thanks to customer growth, tax reform and FirstNet. And we're very excited about the year ahead. With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&A. Michael Viola : Thanks, John. Tony, we are ready for the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : John that was a big nutshell. John Stephens : Thank you. Philip Cusick : So, if I can one for John and one for Randall. First, John, have you talked to the rating agencies about what the appropriate long-term leverage target looks like given the lower tax rate? And then, Randall, sort of following up on things that John said, and I know it's early, but what have you seen from customers in terms of investing in their telecom services post tax reform, probably more conversation so far than orders. But how can that impact AT&T trends going forward? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : So, Phil thanks for that. And one clarification, Mike is here with me, I want to make sure I said this right. We expect to get to more traditional historic levels by 2022 or earlier. And I apologize if I said 2020. The correct number is 2022, which is consistent with the advice we've been giving every time we talk about the deal. Philip Cusick : Makes a little more sense. Randall Stephenson : Phil, we have been in discussions with the rating agencies, but we don't -- we haven't come to any conclusions. We are still in a give and take in that process and we'll continue that. I will -- so, I expect that this will impact their models. I also understand that they are also waiting for us to close the Time Warner deal and to update their models with the new Time Warner information. So, no answer yet, working on it, and we look forward to kind of continue those conversations with the rating agencies. Philip Cusick : Thanks. John Stephens : Yes, Phil, on the capital spending and investment that you said specifically in telecom. We track with this gross fixed investment. If you look at business, gross fixed investment anywhere in the world, our services tend to track with that. Fourth quarter was like a number we hadn't seen in quite some time, gross fixed investment; I think it was over 6%. It was a very, very strong number. Around here, how do high-fives when we see those kind of numbers, because that's usually an indication of general spending, because when businesses spend more capital, they generally hire more people. When they hire more people, they spend more capital. And so, specifically, you'll see businesses adding people, and those people have to have computers, they have to have machinery, they have to have broadband connections, they have to have mobile services, they have to have data connectivity. And so that is a metric we watch closely. The anecdotal evidence, and it's purely anecdotal other than the gross fixed investment, is strong. People are talking about investing more. You've seen announcement after announcement, company saying they're intending to invest more capital as a result of tax reform and so that is our expectation. I think history is a very good indicator of this and when you talk about when you see Apple talking about investing in more facilities and manufacturing in the United States, for a company like AT&T and anybody in our sector, that's a good thing. So, we have pretty good expectations at the B2B side of our house, our enterprise business side could catch some tailwinds. We don't have that build in the guidance we've given you because it's just too early right now. But I'm very optimistic that we're going to overachieve most economic assessments of 2018. You're finally starting to some economists get out there and very bravely just talk about 2.7% growth; I think that is very low. And if we don't have a three hand on economic growth this year, I'll be sorely disappointed and surprised. Philip Cusick : Correct. Thanks Randall. Randall Stephenson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much and good afternoon Randall, John, and Mike. Randall Stephenson : Hi Amir. John Stephens : Hey Amir. Michael Viola : Hey Amir. Amir Rozwadowski : I wanted to touch base a bit on the video industry at this point. How do you think about the status of the linear video market? It does seem as though one of your competitors seems to be taking a more selective or focused approach in terms of their subscribers. How should we think about your go-to-market strategy for that business going forward? And then, John, you had mentioned there are some ongoing pressures through this transition. How do you think about the margin profile of that business going forward? Clearly, you folks are investing in some of these next generation products. Given that those are still subscale, but growing but in investment mode for now, how should we think about the progression of returns of that business going forward? Randall Stephenson : Okay, Amir, I'll go first. I'll talk a bit about the video industry and how we think about it. But since the day we bought DIRECTV, we assume that traditional linear video would be in a declining mode since kind of the nature of it, OTT and the ability to consume video on mobile devices, we believe would be the trend and the way where things went, we wanted to be in the leadership position and facilitating that kind of consumption of premium video on mobile devices. And we have been in the leadership position in that. We have made an objective to ensure that we can transition. We run these transitions all the time, right? When you have technology transitions or business model transitions whether it's fixed phone service to mobile, whether it's a private line kind of service for business to VPN, whether it's -- you can kind of go down the list of whether it's feature phones to smartphones, we run these transitions and we think we're pretty good at it. As it relates to video, we are standing up a video product that we are convinced will give us growth in the video platform for the next few years, and that's our DIRECTV NOW. So, as traditional linear declines, DIRECTV NOW, we think can offset that and not only that, but our traditional linear video will be repurposed. You heard me talk about our next-gen platform that is home centric, a very thin client into the home. That will actually drive cost structure of the traditional video product down so that you could preserve margins in the traditional linear video as you grow in the over-the-top applications and video services. So, we're very bullish on video. As we look at the numbers, our consumers are consuming more value than they used to, not less. They're consuming it on different devices. They're not just consuming it in their home. They're consuming it on tablets and smartphones, and that's where we want to be. And so we're rather bullish on that, Amir. John Stephens : Amir, with regard to legacy or the linear TV product, think about it this way. First of all, key strategy is the bundle. When we are bundling with wireless or when we're bundling with broadband, we're seeing significant improvement. We mentioned that we've got another 170,000 homes this quarter that we've got bundled with wireless and 700,000 wireless customers that were bundled with our satellite TV product. That bundling allows us to have profitability from that combined account. It also creates higher value, lifetime value for each of those customers. When you see us bundling with fiber, what we are seeing is a churn ratio rate that's about half the standalone satellite or video product churn. So, as we expand the fiber to 14 million over the next two years, you'll see us have tremendous opportunities to bundle with video. So, that is great. In addition, we expect to pick up whatever video losses we have and more than that with DIRECTV NOW, and Randall spoke -- just spoke about the aspects of that, that opportunities to improve the revenues profitabilities and the reach to that. And the last thing I'll tell you is with where to our satellite product. We're going to continue to serve what you might consider non-urban or non-suburban America, rural America. We're always going to have an ability to do that on a combined basis with our great wireless service and with our satellite TV process -- products such that we can continue to provide those who lives outside the city limits, so to speak, great quality, great choice. That's how we're thinking about the business. But as we've shown over the last two and a half years, that's all based on a relentless obsession with cost management and continuing to improve the cost structure. And while the advertising opportunities are there for DTV NOW, there clearly also there for our traditional linear TV product. So, those are all the things we're working on. Is it going to be easy? It'll be challenging. But as Randall said, we've been through this time the transition many times before, and we feel up to the task of working through it. Amir Rozwadowski : Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color. John Stephens : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. BatyaLevi: Hi, this is Batya Levi for John. Two questions. One, just following up on the bundling strategy, can you talk about how bundling has started to improve sub-trends both on the video and voice phone side? And if we can expect that to continue into 2018? And how will you balance that sub-growth with profitability? Do you expect wireless margins, which were kind of flattish this year, can they start to improve? And the entertainment profitability has been coming down. Can we see a stop at that? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Yes, so Batya, it's good to hear from you. With regard to bundling on wireless churn, I can't give you a number of basis points, a precision amount of basis points in there. What I can point to is if you look at specifically postpaid phone, which is where the majority are really value-focused bundling is done, we're getting record levels of the low churn. And we attribute at least part of that to the bundling aspect. So, what we're seeing is working. That's the first thing. Secondly, we're also seeing what was a very high level, 700,000 increase year-over-year in smartphone gross adds and upgrades. It continue to significant level of BYOD devices. So, what we're seeing is with this bundling opportunity, customers are continuing to come back to us that have been with us for a while and your customers are coming to us. That's what resulted, not only the great subscriber gains for the quarter, but in some of that, if you will, impact on cost and margins. But when you look at the total profitability, we're very pleased with that and when you look at the churn impacts of that for years to come, you can understand why we make that lifetime value investment. So, that's how we're seeing that. With regard to the video products, we're seeing a similar -- once again I can't point directly as a measurement for basis points. But as I mentioned specifically with fiber, it's cut in half on the bundling. But on Wireless, we're also seeing lowered churn. So, that's been, if you will, very helpful to the overall business. But then when you put those multiple products together and it's not only the reduction service cost with the right to building and administration and so on and so forth, but it's also with that total customers and the ability to track all their services, we do see a long-term past-due greater value creation. That's how we're thinking about that bundling strategy, not on a day-to-day basis, but when you look at these, for example, going to turn on that longer term basis. Churn at these levels is implying 100-month and more lives for these smartphones, tremendous, tremendous opportunities. So, that's what we're looking towards. Lastly, we're going to be able to continue to cut cost. And as we continue to cut cost through virtualization and automization [ph], we're going to be able to continue to maintain. We have been on our path for the last four quarters of setting records in Wireless service margins and we chose this quarter to reinvest in our customer base. When you got churn at those sub-90 basis point levels, it seems like the right thing to do. And with tax reform and the other things that are going on in our business, we feel very comfortable that it is the right thing to do. John Stephens : So, what I'd add to that, Batya, that there's probably no more powerful driver of margins in our industry than low churn. So, you think about what drives low churn. There are two big drivers. Customer SAT is the number one driver of lower churn. But the second is multiproduct bundles with our customers, the more relationships they have with this on different products, the more powerful the driver of churn is. And so that's why we relentless focus on both of these. But the multiproduct services are the second biggest driver of churn improvement that we have. BatyaLevi: Okay. Thank you. Randall Stephenson : Thank you, Batya. We look forward to you being on future calls also. John Stephens : Did you fire John? Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Randall Stephenson : Hi David. David Barden : Appreciate it. I guess I'm that guy this quarter again. So, John, just doing the math on kind of that long series of EPS adjustments kind of taking out the hurts and putting back the helps, it kind of gets to kind of low single-digit EPS growth $2.98 to $3.03 from the $2.92 of this year. And we're looking at-- John Stephens : Let me answer to this. Low single-digits, if you want to pick 1%, 2% or 3%, I'll let you do that and $0.08 of those items that I talked about. When you add them altogether, those items are total about $0.08 of net pressure. That's depreciation, the other three were $0.14 a pressure, net $0.08 of pressure that we're observing. So, just to be straightforward with that. David Barden : Okay, good. Thanks. But on a net basis, still seems to suggest like something is still moderating from 2017. I think we saw about $1 billion of EBITDA pressure in 2017. And I was wondering if you can kind of talk about into 2018 kind of how that EBITDA versus non-EBITDA below the line stuff is getting you to that EPS number. And then the second piece of it is just I mean last quarter, I asked us about the enterprise flattening out. You said that there was some green shoots emerging in the pricing environment. You've actually had a pretty stable enterprise Wireline business for the whole year now. And with the essentially level three merger kind of consolidating the space, is stable the new outlook or are we kind of turning a corner here? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes, let me with the enterprise business. We did not, as I mentioned in our guidance that our basis for our guidance. We did assume a dramatic shift in the GDP. We certainly expect continued investment, as Randall mentioned. We expect that to turn into orders, we just didn't know when and so we haven't modeled that in. With regard to the most recent activity, we did there were some management actions, the team took we saw some improvement in our trends on our legacy revenues and some continued positive growth on our strategic services. If that continues and we can continue to pressure that through the year along with some tax reform initiated demand, there's an opportunity for us to do better than what we've modeled, better than what we've given in the guidance. So, we are hopeful and we're watching and we're going to be careful with that. With regard to the items, David, with regard to 2018 and the operational side, improvements in Mexico, continued strong performance in Latin America, we'll continue to see some pressure from legacy revenues like wireline voice and then some early challenges with wireless service as we lap the first year of unlimited and then a movement towards voice service revenue improvement in growth. Those are the things that are going on in the business. One thing I will point out. Remember, about $0.05 of the pressure for next year is going to be an interest expense. That's a below the line item. That's from -- no longer capitalizing the interest expense regarding the spectrum we're going to put to service with the FirstNet. That was part of that $0.08 that I was talking about. So, while we're not giving specific guidance on margins, or on EBITDA levels, I want to make sure I give you is much color as I should to your question. David Barden : Thanks John. And just the kind of takeaway, is the EBITDA, kind of, trajectory still pretty much in the same ZIP Code or are we seeing that improve, and that's kind of helping that EPS story? John Stephens : Yes, I'll just say it this way, you have to have good solid performance in the business to overcome those pressures and to still come in that mid-single-digits -- or excuse me, come into low single-digits EPS growth. You have to have strong performance in the business. And the biggest item that is on that EBITDA -- two big items that we talked about. One, depreciation, which we've laid out and then two is the interest expense. Those go in large margin to offset each other. David Barden : Great. All right. Thanks John. Randall Stephenson : David, I'm probably on the optimistic side of business spending, as you heard my answer to Phil's question. But as you just kind of look at fourth quarter up and down the business segment, it just -- wasn't just concentrated in one area, it was multinationals all the way down to small business. We're just showing signs of improvement. And so I find myself getting somewhat optimistic. The business spending is really going to accelerate as we work through 2018. David Barden : From your mouth, Randall. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks. Good evening. Randall, you touched a little bit on 5G and you put out a couple of press releases this year. It was obviously in the news the last couple of days. Can you just talk about where you are, what you've learned from the trial so far, and what should we be looking to you and AT&T for 2018 in 5G? What are the used cases that will get you most excited? And then, John, just coming back to the ASC 606, the $0.10 to $0.15, I think Verizon had said that by 2020, that would sort of wind down to kind of a neutral impact. Is that the same math for you? Thanks. John Stephens : Randall let me think the ASC 606 first. Yes, over a period of years, it will balance out as the contracts lap each other. So, yes, that's the kind of thought. And as I mentioned, the other item is with us and compares us to others, we didn't adopt deferred installment accounting that coming lease in the cable industry, we adopted and that with the DIRECTV merger. So, a lot of the items along with our next accounting that we've already been using will, to some people, give an impression that our numbers are not as much as they otherwise might have expected. Randall? Randall Stephenson : On 5G, Simon, the used case I get most excited about is the opportunity to have nearly, a nationwide broadband footprint and it could be a fixed line replacement. The capacity is there, the performance is there, there's going to be full gigabit throughput. And so I get very energized on the opportunity over the next few years to actually build out a nationwide capability for broadband for both business as well as consumer. And so those are the ones, by the way, that from the technology is probably the easiest to scale and so forth. But as you begin to think about mobile solutions, we will be deploying mobile solutions in 2018 and it's going to be in 12 markets, that's what we've been doing. Think of this as a puck. Because, really, the thing is going to cause 5G to go slow more than anything else, it's just availability of handsets. We're getting the equipment manufacturing moving, we're getting the supply chains moving, we're doing the sell-side acquisition, we're doing all the build type work, but getting the handsets at scale penetrated into the market will slow things down. So, that's why we're going to be pucks in the first part of our deployment in these 12 market, so it is a mobile solution. But it's not going to be a handset. There's not going to be that many handsets available. We'll be pushing the vendors to make that happen faster. But we know how long these things take and how long it takes them to penetrate the market. As you think about other applications, the easy ones of that we all talk about is autonomous cars. And in fact, I just don't think those used cases work without 5G technology. It's all about low latency. People say 5G and you're thinking about speed. And speed and throughput is important. But the most important element is latency and having low latency 5G is the first technological innovation that truly gets us to low latency. And as we think about a distributing cloud environment, we think we're in a unique place to begin distributing the cloud capability into our infrastructure. Think of all the nodes, all the access points that we have in our network distributing cloud at that level, we can take latency to a lower level than we think, virtually anybody else, but it will be a competition, it will be a race and we'll see who gets there first. But the latency is exciting. The latency is also critical for as you think about super IoT, connected devices, and connecting everything. It's going to be important for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. So, we're taking this, to your point, used case-by-used case and that is what's determining our deployment and our build plans, our used cases and it's centered around predominantly these areas that I just articulated to you. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Randall Stephenson : Thank you, Simon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong : Thanks. And following up on the Entertainment Group, you exited 4Q with really solid video trends. Do you still think you can grow a video pie and maybe perhaps, outpace the traditional pay-TV environment? And I think, previously you've updated us on the mix of DIRECTV NOW subscribers, can you give us the mix of cord cutters and where they are coming from, that will be helpful? Thank you. Randall Stephenson : So, a couple of things. We would expect to continue grow video customers with our DIRECTV NOW outpacing our linear customer counts in the sense of net additions. So, we do expect that. Secondly, I would suggest to you that the mix hasn't changed much. We're still getting around 50% of them from cord nevers and around 50% of cord cutters or cord shavers. Secondly, we are getting a disproportionate amount of those customers being multiple dwelling units, millennials, and others -- specifically those two groups and we're excited about that. So, as we move through the process we'll continue. We still haven't seen a dramatic uptick in customers that are shifting from our full value product to the DTV NOW, but we continue to watch that carefully and continue to come up with different ways to make sure we can prove that and track that. But in kind of total video customer base, we do believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow just like we did in the fourth quarter. John Stephens : Exactly our plan, Amy. We'll grow our TV customer base is the expectation. And as we continue to mature the DIRECTV NOW platform, we think we can actually do better. The new DIRECTV NOW platform has a lot more functionality. So, once you get cloud-based DVRs and you can put a third stream, now all of a sudden, you're entering a new marketplace with those as well and getting new functionality, we think we get higher penetration. So, we're actually very bullish on DIRECTV NOW. We think convinced economics will continue to improve as we move over the next couple of years. Amy Yong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question that will come from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey guys thank you for taking the question. One on capital allocation, I just -- with the significant cash savings you're laying off from tax reform, are there any areas of the business you're looking to potentially accelerate investment in beyond fiber? And on the fiber topic, does this change at all how you think about that 14 million fiber homes past target beyond mid-2019? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Yes, I get it. Look tax reform changes everything as it relates to capital allocation, Matthew and if I understand that as well as anybody. But when you're suddenly looking at your after-tax returns improving by 20% roughly, it just changes how you think about your investment thesis. It changes the profitability equation on fiber as well as 5G and how you think about rural and how you think about FirstNet. And so it gives us the ability to consider starting to push our fiber deployments faster and further. And it's early. It's hard to say what it will mean as you own a media and entertainment company. But how does it affect the decision-making as it relates to investment in premium content, as it relates to direct-to-consumer distribution and how fast you go in those regards. So it's -- we've been planning for this for quite some time. But now that it's here and it's real, we're going through, we're digging in, and ask what are these projects that we want to be investing in and these initiatives we want to be investing in that could continue to drive growth over the next five or six years and let's take advantage of it. John Stephens : Now, we are expecting more money on fiber to accelerate the process and achieve our goals and then we'll have the opportunity to look to expand. Secondly, we are, if you will, excited about and I think the team is working very, very hard to achieve the FirstNet goals and even exceeding the goals set out by the FirstNet authority. That's a really positive thing for us. And while we were interested in doing that for some time, tax reform and the cash generate, the cash savings aspect that provide us that opportunity -- flexibility to go after that even more. So, those are two areas where I think you'll really see us utilize the benefits of the new tax laws. Matthew Niknam : Thanks Randall, thanks John. Randall Stephenson : You bet. Michael Viola : Hey Tony, this is Michael; we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you, sir. That will come from Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Scott Goldman : Hey guys, good afternoon. And thanks for fitting me in. Maybe Randall, if you can just talk a little bit about the wireless competitive environment. Obviously, still very competitive, but it seems like we've been operating in a pretty -- in a more rational environment of late, and that's driven some better results in fourth quarter. Just wondering how you think about, overall, what you're embedding in your outlook in terms of the competition in 2018? And maybe just a quick one follow-up with John on that same question. How do you think about the puts and takes on ARPU based on the expectations for competition in 2018? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : My outlook for wireless competition is that it will continue to be intensely competitive and we don't see that changing. How people are competing has changed somewhat and how we're competing is changing quite a bit. I'm not going to go into a lot of details because we made some moves in the fourth quarter and you're going to see those continue into the first, second, and third quarter. We think are going to be very effective and has been very effective in the marketplace. But I'll call it smarter competitions, smarter way in approaching our customer base and in accessing new customers. We believe very strongly that combining video with our mobile product is a really important element. And you will see us continue to do that. But actually, probably take it to new and different levels because it's proving so powerful on churn. We're also getting to place we've learned enough that is becoming very powerful as it relates to customer acquisition. And so combining video with wireless is a really important driver and you've seen some of the industry begin to make moves to mimic that, which is usually an indication that you're having success and so you'll see more and more of that. But it'll remain competitive, but we feel really good about how we're set up, what we're doing in the marketplace and that we'll continue to even take that a step further as we move through 2018. John Stephens : Scott, on the ARPU side, let me first make sure we're clear with regard to rev rack and the adoption of it and it's an unusual accounting change and then it's a flash cut. So, couple of the changes include regulatory fees, USF [ph] which we can't a service revenue today. And then also, in the expense line, they'll be netted. So, ARPU will come because we're pulling back out. Secondly, there will be some of the service revenue that's called service revenue today we'll get allocated to equipment revenues in the future for that small number of situations where we still subsidize equipment. Once you take that into account, you will have comparable ARPU and I just want to make sure everybody knows that. With regard to the opportunities for ARPU, I think about it in a total profitability situation, not just in an ARPU situation. So, we certainly are looking to do as strong as we can on ARPU and as many services. But as Randall said at the beginning, we're relentless on this lowest cost per megabit provider. And as we get to that, we can be very successful with things like prepaid or other alternative levels of ARPU. My only point is that though we bundle with regard to video and broadband wireless together and we get great ARPUs from those, there will be situations where we will look to accept lower ARPUs like in prepaid. And because of the very low cost structure, because of the billing, or general administrative cost, because of opportunities to maybe get that analytics value out of it, we'll be able to still be profitable, or we'll be able to expand the base of customers and be able to make more total profit that way. So, that's one of the reasons why we're not giving EBITDA margin guidance, is because we want to focus on this total cash, total profitability position. So, our ARPUs will continue to be measured relentlessly and we'll continue to analyze of them in the same way. I want you to understand that we're really focused of that total service revenue growth, total revenue growth, total profitability as opposed to just any one aspect. Scott Goldman : Understood. Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Very good. Thank you, Scott. And listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. 2017 was a truly unique year for American business, U.S. business. And I think 2018 is going to prove to be a really good year for the realization of the implications of what was done in 2017. And I think the consumer is going to be better off, I think wages are going to be higher as businesses invest more. And as a result, AT&T being a very U.S. centric company, we think we're going to have a good year ahead of us as well. So, again, thank you for joining us and look forward to talking to you next time. Operator : Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, there'll be an opportunity here for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Like Justin said, this is Mike Viola. I'm Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to cover our results and provide business updates, which will include progress on FirstNet, and then we'll follow that up with a Q&A session. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K and a variety of associated schedules. Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. That says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, and those results may differ materially. And additional information is always available on the Investor Relations website. Also, I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC CAF-II auction and so we can't address any questions about that today. And so now, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide 3. As we mentioned last quarter and noted it in 8-K filed last month, AT&T was required to adopt several new accounting standards this year. These new accounting standards deal with reporting issues around revenue recognition, pension costs, financial instruments, and cash receipts on installment receivables. These changes have some impact on our income statements and our cash flows. And in connection with adopting the new standard on revenue recognition, the company will now record Universal Service and other regulatory fees on a net basis, consistent with how we have traditionally reported other pass-through items like sales taxes. This specific change will reduce both revenues and expenses by a little more than $900 million this quarter, but will not \u2013 they will not impact operating income or net income for the quarter. In addition to GAAP, we're providing comparable historical results to help you better understand the impact on financials from revenue recognition. We will be referring to these historical results in our comparisons during this call. Tax reform gave us the opportunity to invest and grow our customer base. These investments drove a significant year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds, the second-highest broadband quarter in 3 years and solid growth in video, as we transition our TV business. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.85, up about $0.15 with benefits from tax reform and revenue recognition, offsetting the costs of investing in our growing customer base and a small amount of pressure from the new financial instrument reporting rules. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over year on a reported basis, but down on a comparable basis. Our increased sales activities this quarter drove much of the pressure we saw, as did continued transition of video from linear to over-the-top services. But at the same time, we did see margin improvements in business wireline and international. Next, let's cover revenue, which was $38.9 billion, down from a year ago. Higher wireless equipment and strategic service revenues partially offset declines in legacy services, the ongoing impact of the video transition and our decision to no longer pursue some low-margin businesses. Cash flow statements have been recast to show the impact of the new accounting standard with installment receivables, so year-over-year cash flow results are comparable. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest free cash flow quarter and this year is no different. Several items impacted free cash flow, including our annual employee bonus program, a larger than usual handset payment from the very strong gross add and upgrade performance during the light holiday season in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter. We also had unreimbursed FirstNet expenditures in this quarter. Offsetting some of this pressure was a tax refund we received in the first quarter, which was generated by the passage of the tax reform act in late December of last year. We're still on plans to meet the free cash flow guidance we gave you in January. That guidance of free cash flow in the $21 billion range included the pressure from the receivables accounting change. Capital spending was $6.1 billion in the quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with Mobility, where the team turned in solid customer growth. Those details are on slide 4. AT&T's domestic Mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Strong sales activity in a usually quiet quarter helped drive a turnaround in postpaid phone net adds. Postpaid phone net adds showed a more than 300,000 phone improvement compared to the year ago first quarter, which is now more than 700,000 year-over-year improvement in the last two quarters. Prepaid phones also came in strong, with about 190,000 new subscribers, and that's helped our Cricket customer base grow. And today, its total is 9 million customers. Congrats to our management team that runs Cricket. And we increased our branded smartphone base by nearly 500,000, topping 73 million by the end of the quarter. Churn keeps improving. We had another record low first quarter postpaid phone churn of 0.84%, improving both year over year and sequentially. Altogether, we had more than 2.6 million new subscribers, that's domestic subscribers, with gains in postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, more than offsetting our continued losses in resellers. Revenues were up more than 3% in the quarter, thanks to our strong smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially flat sequentially. We're confident that service revenues will improve throughout the year and still expect that we'll be positive for the full year on a comparable basis. There are several reasons for that. First, we're now through the toughest year-over-year compare as we lap the introduction of unlimited plans that came out in the first quarter a year ago. We're adding postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, subscribers at rapid rates, and the pressure from reseller is stabilizing. Recent new product offerings will also help. Our strong sales activity also had an impact on margins. Postpaid smartphone gross adds and upgrades increased by about 500,000 year over year. That's an upgrade rate of 4. 3%, which was higher than last year, still service margins came in at 48.1% on a comparable basis. Our long-term strategy to build our branded phone base and improve churn with bundled services continues to pay off. Postpaid smartphones have increased by almost 2 million in the last two years. Prepaid smartphones have also increased at a solid clip, growing by 3.4 million in the same timeframe. That's more than five million growth in overall domestic smartphone base. At the same time, a growing number of our existing Mobility customers are bundling their wireless with our video and our broadband services. These are the most valuable customers with churn significantly lower than single-service customers. These results are very encouraging and gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest in our customer base. Now let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results on slide 5. The positive impact of TV and broadband promotions and our ability to bundle services can be seen in our Entertainment Group results. Total video customers, broadband connections and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW continued its solid run of subscriber growth. More than 300,000 DTV NOW subs were added in the first quarter, giving us nearly 1.5 million customers in service. This over-the-top video growth has helped us manage the industry-wide transition of linear TV subscribers to over-the-top services. Looking at total video subs, we actually have more subscribers today than we did two years ago because of the success of DIRECTV NOW. This is especially important at a time when the industry is seeing increasing pressure from customers cutting the cord. Transitions such as this are never easy, but we have shown that we're able to do this time and time again, whether it'd be with our voice or broadband or wireless services. We don't expect video to be any different. We do expect revenue and margin pressure as we manage through this, especially this year, but we're excited about DIRECTV NOW's product improvement and our new user interface that we're beta testing right now and expect to roll out soon. This has cloud-based DVR capabilities and supports an additional video stream per account. Later this year, we expect a more robust VOD experience and new pay-per-view options to be released. These new services will add new revenue streams and help counter some of the revenue and margin pressure we are dealing with. The over-the-top model also is low touch, with significantly lower subscriber acquisition cost and less capital investment. As we manage the over-the-top transition, we are completing our broadband transition from DSL to IP broadband. About 800,000 of our residential broadband customers are still on legacy DSL. That compares very favorably to about 4.5 million legacy DSL customers just four years ago, so we are managing through this transition. This has helped drive growing broadband momentum for us. We had 154,000 high-speed broadband net adds in the quarter and 82,000 total broadband net adds. Our fiber build now passes more than 8 million customer locations, nearly all consumer, and you see its impact on our broadband numbers. Customer response has been terrific. In areas where they have marketed fiber for the last two years, our penetration rate is nearly 50%. That's quite a bit higher than in our non-fiber markets and leaves us a lot of room to run over the next couple years. Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. As a reminder, wireless subscribers and specifically individual wireless subscribers who buy off a company plan have been moved from Business Solutions to Consumer Mobility. Historical financials have been recast to reflect that change. Business Solutions revenues were down slightly, as gains in wireless and strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy services. Wireless revenues were up nearly 4%. Equipment revenues were up with increased sales, while service revenues were essentially flat. Wireline revenues were down about 3% year over year, an improvement over recent quarters and similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. This improving trend in wireline is encouraging, and this comes before any expected bump from business activity that we might see with tax reform. Another positive is the significant improvement in business wireline margins, where EBITDA grew year over year and margins were up 190 basis points on a comparative basis. The team continues to do a great job in driving cost management initiatives. We're also beginning to see operating expense savings from our move to a virtualized software-defined network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, and we expect to have 65% virtualized by the end of this year, well on our way to meet or exceed our goal of 75% virtualized by 2020. Our international business also turned in another strong quarter, thanks to solid revenue gains in Mexico. These results are at the bottom of slide 6. Revenues were up more than 7%. EBITDA was up significantly, thanks to strength in Latin America and improvements in Mexico. Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 500,000 new subscribers in the quarter and more than 3 million in the past year and now have 15.6 million customers in total. Reported service revenues were down slightly due to our first quarter decision to shut down a wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel. Without that roughly $90 million reduction in revenues, reported service revenues were up year over year. And our Latin America satellite operations continue to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow. Over the last few quarters, we explored the possibility of issuing an IPO for our DIRECTV Latin America video properties, but ended up withdrawing our offer. We just didn't believe it was the right time to transact. Current market conditions obviously played a role, and trade, interest rates, market volatility and foreign exchange all played their part. DIRECTV Latin America has been a steady performer for us, contributing both profitability and free cash flow. We'll continue to look for ways to unlock the value of those properties for investors while increasing our optionality. Now, I'd like to provide you updates on our Time Warner acquisition and our goal to build the world's premier gigabit network. Those details are on slide 7. I'm not sure I need to update anyone on the status of our bid to merge with Time Warner, but here's the latest. Both sides are wrapping up their cases and are now preparing for closing arguments on April 30. After that, we'll wait for the court's ruling. Based on the court's determination, we stand ready to close. Funding is in place, even after we settle the special mandatory redemption bonds. There's not much more we can add at this point. I'd also like to update you on our ongoing efforts to improve our networks. FirstNet continues its strong start. We launched the first and only nationwide FirstNet dedicated network core last month. This network core acts like the brains and nervous system of FirstNet and is on physically separate hardware. Only FirstNet traffic will move through this core. This will serve as a springboard for ongoing innovation and advanced functionality, delivering value-added capabilities and benefits that commercial cores can't match. This includes always-on access to priority and ruthless pre-emption. The FirstNet network also is open for FirstNet-ready and FirstNet-capable devices. These devices support all AT&T commercial LTE bands and the FirstNet Band 14 and meet band priority selection technical requirements. So far, nearly 650 agencies across 48 states and territories are already subscribing to FirstNet services. We see this as a real growth opportunity. We've also started the heavy lifting of putting Band 14 on our towers. Over the next 5 years, we'll be putting Band 14 on tens of thousands of new and existing sites nationwide. We plan to touch about a third of our cell sites this year alone. Our new Crown Castle agreement will help us speed this process. The agreement simplifies and expands our long-term leasing deal for wireless network infrastructure. This will give us more flexibility as we deploy FirstNet as well as 5G technologies. We're working hard to build something great for first responders. With the introduction of the FirstNet core, first responders finally have the network that they have been asking for and that they deserve. In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work continues its accelerated development in several different areas that will pave the way to the next generation of higher speeds and quality for customers. 5G Evolution is made up of carrier aggregation, 4X4 MIMO and 256-QAM technologies, along with LTE-Local Assist Access (sic) [LTE-Licence Assisted Access] or LTE-LAA. These are building blocks towards the transition to 5G and will deliver speeds substantially faster than LTE. 5G Evolution has now expanded to 141 markets, and we expect to reach more than 500 markets by the end of the year. Our fixed 5G trials also are providing valuable real-world millimeter-wave spectrum experiences both to businesses and residential customers. We're seeing gigabit-plus speeds under line-of-sight conditions to distances up to 900 feet and with extremely low latency rates, some as low as 9 milliseconds. These trials as shown in millimeter-wave is able to penetrate foliage, glass and even walls better than anticipated with no discernible signal performance impacts due to rain, snow or other weather issues. Granted, these are early results in trial conditions, but we are excited about what we have seen so far. The backbone for 5G or any wireless network is fiber and our fiber network is extensive and growing. We're on track to surpass our commitment as part of the DIRECTV deal to build fiber to 12.5 million customer locations. We now reached more than 8 million locations with fiber and plan to hit 10 million by the end of this year. This is in addition to the 8 million business locations that we pass today within 1,000 feet with fiber. These 16 million locations and the more than 1 million route miles of fiber in our overall network are the backbone of our network and our move to 5G. With FirstNet 5G and fiber build, our network development has never moved at a faster pace. We're excited about the progress we're making and even more excited about where our network will be in a very short time. That's it for my presentation. Mike, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Justin, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you. First, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe first starting on Entertainment Group really on slide 5, John, I just want to make sure I'm reading this correctly in terms of the exhibit you put here. That everything left of that vertical line is historical accounting method. And if that's true the way I'm reading it, can you just confirm that? Yeah. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah. So the historical accounting method is effectively publishing first quarter 2018 results under the old rules, so you've got comparability with last year's first quarter. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess, just doing that, it would seem that the Entertainment EBITDA is down in the range of about 19%, if you could confirm that, and then on an apples-to-apples basis. And then, if so, can you just talk about what's driving that pressure? You talked about DIRECTV satellite subs declining and some of the expenditures you're going through to stand up DIRECTV NOW and the marketing and maybe then move to the new platform. How should we expect those drivers to evolve over the course of the year? The satellite losses are like they're picking up on a year-over-year basis. Should we expect that to continue and put further pressure, I guess, on those margins from that new 22.8% level? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yes. So a couple of things, John. First of all, I think on a year-over-year basis, our linear video losses are actually less. As you can see on the chart in the middle there, they're actually going down, so that's improving. We've seen some improvement in our churn rate. And as for (24:21) John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : I was just looking at the \u2013 I was thinking of the satellite-over-satellite number. Like the \u2013 I think it was 188,000 versus I think zero you did a year ago. I guess, the outlook is \u2013 I guess, your traditional's got a little better, but how do you see the satellite stuff evolving over the next 12 months? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I think we're going to continue to see challenges in the satellite in the linear pay-TV model as we've talked about. We'll continue to see real opportunities to shift to the over-the-top and continue to grow DTV NOW. And then, what we will see is, as we come out with our new platform along that's in beta and then, quite frankly, some updates that we would hope to have by the end of this year, where you'll start seeing things like cloud DVR revenues, pay-per-view revenues, both sports and movies, some of the opportunities for additional streams and then eventually, revenues for advertising and data insights. We'll see a replacement of the margins and a growth in those margins on an extremely low capital expenditure basis. So we'll transition through that. That's what our expectations on that. Am I answering your question, John? That's what I'm trying to do. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: That's the process we're going through. It'll be challenging. It's hard work. It'll take us some time, not expect it to be completed this year. But we are optimistic about total video counts growing over 100,000 and the significant year-over-year improvement in total video, almost 300,000 improvement. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : All right. I guess, John, what I'm trying to get at is the margin trajectory from here on new accounting methodology, 22.8%. Should we expect a similar trajectory from this new level as we look out to the year? Or would you expect it to stabilize as we move through the year, just given all the puts and takes? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yes. I think we'll see some pressure throughout the year, but starting to stabilize at the end of the year. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I do believe we'll see some ongoing pressure through the year. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, John. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Take our next question, Justin. Operator : Sure. We have the line of Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. And afternoon, John and Mike. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Wanted to touch base on the Mobility segment. If we think about the competitive landscape and your approach to the competitive landscape at this point, how should we think about the trade-off of subscriber acquisition versus margins? To John's prior question, if we look at it on a like-for-like basis for Mobility, we did see some pressure on a year-over-year basis against the historical margin structure. And just trying to think about the prospects for improving that going forward or how we should think about the puts and takes there. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yes, Amir, it's a good question. What we're thinking about is we're making the investments in the customer base from, if you will, initial basis. So things like BOGOs or offers on equipment. Getting that and getting the customers in and then having that ability to retain them for what is now 120 months as opposed to moving towards a recruiting tool that would be based on service revenues that would occur every month. So we're taking that investment on an upfront basis where we can identify it, taking that pressure through margin certainly, but then knowing that we have this improving churn and this reliability and the ability then to add other services, whether it be broadband, whether it be video, whether it be wireless. That's how we're viewing it. So we've got kind of an ability to turn on and off our investment opportunity and our customer growth. We've, so to speak, had it turned on in fourth quarter last year and then first quarter this year, but I think you've seen that over 700,000 smartphone improvement in the last two quarters over the prior year's two quarters. So if this \u2013 take responsibility for that investment today and get it over with and then get the benefits not only over the 10 years we own the \u2013 that the customer stays with us, but quite frankly, start getting the benefits from it in the very next quarter or the very next month as you have that investment behind you. That's how we're thinking about it and that's how we go about it. I will tell you, we're trying different data-informed offers and we're exchanging them when we see things work or not work appropriately, and we'll continue to do that. But the best we can, we've focused on these investments to the customer base that revolve around getting everything upfront, knowing what the total cost is going to be and then moving forward. From a competitive environment, we've seen some moderating of the competitive environment over the last few months. There continues to be some changes in that and some offers that we see that we're never sure if they are temporary or permanent, but overall, we had seen some moderation in the environment. And we have, as you can see, performed really pretty well with our really, really low postpaid churn growth in prepaid and really, really improved growth in the postpaid phone trends. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful, John. And then, to your point on churn, we continue to see a decline on a year-over-year basis. What is your expectation through the course of the year? As you mentioned, we are seeing some changes in the competitive landscape. Is the expectation that you're able to continue to drive churn lower through the course of the year? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: We haven't given specific guidance to churn, but let me say this. We're striving to continue to improve churn on a year-over-year basis. Our strategy though really get to what we've seen is when we're able to bundle it with another service, a broadband, a video, wireless, any two or three of those together, we see better churn. And so we also have that and that's a differentiating viewpoint or differentiating capability that we have uniquely that others don't. And so when we can do that, we do have some optimism about the ability not only to maintain these great churn levels but even see some further improvement likely we did this quarter, both sequentially and year over year. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for the incremental color. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Next, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hey, Simon. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On the video programming, I think Randall had \u2013 was reportedly made their comment around introducing a AT&T watch offering for $15 bundled with wireless. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color about that and what timing we have around that? And then coming back to wireless, I noted the upgrade rate ticked up to 4.3% from 3.9%. And I think you'd, in the past, talked about going through this period of very low upgrade rate and then it would start to normalize over time. So it'd be great just to understand was the 4.3% do you think you're getting back to a more normal rate right now and any other color around how long people are keeping handsets or renewing them. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Simon. Good questions. So, first of all, our upgrade rate and quite frankly, both the upgrade and the gross adds number, so we had about 0.5 million more devices in the first quarter in the upgrade rates and the gross adds. So we had a big step up. I think that was due to a lot of enthusiasm due to our great offers that the team put out. I think there was some pent-up demand for new innovative devices. And there may have been some change in the fact that devices have gotten another quarter older and people wanted to upgrade. But I think the biggest driver was really our offers. That's one thing. Two, that's caused some pressure with regard to expenses on this comparable basis. If you use the comparable basis, then a lot of those expenses, particularly with regard to BOGO-type offers, may have fallen to the bottom line and caused some pressure there. So that's a reality. On those, we're more than willing to pay that, if you will, make that investment to get the long-term and, quite frankly, immediate short-term additional revenues. I don't know that the upgrade rate itself because the age of devices has changed that much. I do believe our offers drove the increase in the upgrade rate. And the new iPhones may have driven some of it because of the limitation and the lateness that they came in, in the fourth quarter, and some of our customers using BOGOs to buy those in the first. So that's how I view that. We'll continue to watch it. I don't believe we're going to go back to the historic upgrade rates. I think those are clearly a matter of history. And even though the fact that we're talking about 4.3% being a big increase in the upgrade rate gives you the sense of we used to talk about normal upgrade rates being a lot higher percentages. With regard to the video programming, let me just say this. As we move forward through this year and are able to continue to innovate, we'll have a lot of offers in wireless and broadband and in video. One of those would be the one that you're referring to that Randall mentioned, a DTV watch-type program. We'll leave it to my marketing and sales team to come out with the details on that. I know they're going to do a lot better job than I could. But I think the more important message is that we are willing to innovate. We are willing to try some different things to grow the customer base in the right way and continue to be able to grow the overall business on a bundled basis. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Fair, thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next we have Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just circling back on the Entertainment Group and some of the pressures there, I was just thinking about \u2013 I think Randall recently was quoted as comparing it to the legacy wireline voice business of old. And I don't think there's much argument that linear is under tremendous pressure. But as you look at that unit or that segment, how much of the cost is variable? And as you think about the piece parts within that, which parts of it can you reduce with the sub counts versus more structural fixed costs? And then on the content cost side, which I presume is mostly variable, what benefits you guys are getting as far as cost goes or negotiating power goes with the programmers for the DIRECTV NOW product? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Again, Mike, good question, a couple things. I guess I'd view the cost of this, sorry, on the video entertainment piece of it, on the video side, that content is variable with regard to the packages we sell. But I also think there's some opportunity going forward to be variable with regard to within the packages. And I think we've made reference to possibly some offers, possibly getting to a point where we have differentiated offers and different packages. We have some today continuing to do that. So I think there is some, not only just based on the volume of customers but also based on what the customers want to buy, and we'll continue to look for that. On the high-speed Internet side or the broadband side, I would suggest to you what we've been building into that 8 million fiber, quite frankly, is something we still have a lot of selling to do into. And so that capital has been spent and that capacity to serve is already out there. We're just in this process of growing this IP broadband base and serving it. So I would suggest to you that could be a change or provide new direction, particularly as we've gotten through the legacy DSL conversions, which has really been absorbing us for the last few years. On the legacy voice and data, those challenges continue to be there. Those costs either have been managed out or continue to be managed out. So that's how we think about this. But on the video side, the real growth here is going to be in these alternative services, whether it's cloud DVRs, pay-per-views, data insights, advertising, doing those kinds of things while growing broadband at a high-speed level and continuing the success we've had. And then as you look at that Entertainment Group, bundling the two of those together, but also bundling all that with wireless, and so that's the real strength in it. That's what makes it worth all the efforts that we're going through to transition it. So it's not just one individual piece, but it's the collection of those pieces that make this very attractive. Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one is just a quick housekeeping question. The new USF accounting, you noted that it's neutral to operating income. Can you clarify? Is it also neutral to EBITDA? I think that might help some comparability. And then just coming back to the Entertainment segment, the U-verse video base has been remarkably flat. Particularly, I think you added a customer \u2013 a couple customers this quarter. I was hoping maybe you could provide a little more insight as to why that is. And is that more directly tied to the adoption of your residential fiber product than perhaps what we're seeing in the satellite trends? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: A couple of things. One, yes, on EBITDA, the USF revenue and expenses are both in the EBITDA calculations, so they will net to zero. It won't have any change to EBITDA. I will tell you, though, Brett, to be clear, in prior years that USF revenue was in service revenues. And so it impacted service EBITDA margins, not EBITDA itself as a number, but the margins. We believe this will give a better picture of what we actually collect from customers on our behalf versus what we collect on the government's behalf, much like sales taxes, which we had never previously counted as service revenues. So you're right. It does not affect EBITDA, operating income, or EBITDA. The starting point, though, would be, would it have an impact on service revenues. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: U-verse, I think essentially a couple different things. One, the fiber build and the fiber capabilities, the broadband capabilities make that natural bundle very good. Two, U-verse is in our historic legacy telephone company footprint, where we generally have very good wireless capabilities, distribution, and have had actually better results in bundling when we have all aspects to that. So that's another point. Brett, I would tell you the need to migrate U-verse in the satellite to take advantage of differentiating content costs is ebbing or is greatly reduced than possibly it was when we first merged with DIRECTV. All of those things are part of the process. And quite frankly, customer satisfaction with the U-verse product is probably the most important consideration. The people are happy. So those are all things that contribute to that aspect. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just a quick follow-up question. I think you had previously indicated that when the DIRECTV satellite product was being sold in your landline region, you were seeing better results there because you could bundle with broadband. Is that still playing out? Or are you finding that the U-verse video product is still a much more natural bundle with your broadband offer? John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: I won't say in comparison to the two U-verse compared to satellite, but I will tell you that we do believe that we do better and have better churn stats when we can bundle video, both satellite and U-verse. U-verse cannot by definition, but satellite, we have better churn results and better customer experiences when we can bundle with our IP broadband. And to that point, just another reason for the fiber build and the opportunity that it presents as well as what FirstNet will provide to, quite frankly, all our satellite customer with regard to the potential for much better quality wireless service. So all of that kind of plays together. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next, we have the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi guys. Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Hi, Phil. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, John. First, a follow-up. You were fairly aggressive in the first quarter in the wireless compared to previous first quarters, but a lot of these promotions fell away in April. Should we think about this as a new level of aggression for the full year or are you just changing up the seasonality? And then, a bigger question, John, the online and addressable advertising business seems to be under fire on a lot of fronts and there's some increased investor preference lately for online subscription businesses. How do the headlines impact your thinking around AT&T strategy of accruing content and the OTT transition and the trade you seem to be making of giving up subscription revenue to drive subscribers in an effort to build the targeted advertising opportunity? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So, Phil, with regard to aggressiveness, I would suggest you we have the capabilities to be aggressive in the first quarter. We did that. We tried different things. As you can tell, we did that in the fourth quarter, too. As you pointed out, we changed them as we've gone through to make sure what we were doing was working and was getting the results, not only just results but the results we wanted. And we're continuing to focus on data-informed decisions in that light. What I'd suggest you is we should continue to see us something like the three offers that we've, I guess, recently put out in the marketplace. In New York, where we're using video as an opportunity to attract customers; in Chicago, where we're using our capabilities with regard to broadband to attract customers; or in Los Angeles, where we're using wireless. We're trying to be market-directed, market-informed and trying to put offers out that'll, if you will, make a difference. You can expect to continue to see us change some things, try some things. We might do a BOGO and then we might do a second one is a 50% fee as opposed to a full BOGO. I think we recently did that with wireless offering. So you'll see us make changes on a regular basis. We're trying to, if you will, make sure we're willing to invest this opportunity in the customer base to grow the business and the opportunities for the long-term. I don't want to suggest that our, if you will, investment levels will continue to be at the same level they were in the first quarter. We'll go through that process as we go through the year and make the right decisions for the short-term and the long-term for the business. But I do expect we'll continue to look at things on a regular basis as we've been doing even here in April. With regard to \u2013 the recent issues with regard to, I'll call it, customer datas and customer, if you will, rights with regard to that data, we continue to respect our customers. We've been the guys that have been in the business of, if you will, simply put unlisted numbers for 100 years. We understand the customers' data and privacy and how to deal with that. We're the ones who have pushed for a consumer Bill of Rights and pushed that legislative earlier this year, long before this became a headline story of the recent month. So we continue to believe, and, if you will, respecting your customers' privacy and treating them the right way will provide the long-term results. With that being said, we continue to believe in the processes and practices we have in place as being appropriate. And we continue to believe that there is a space for us as a trusted adviser and a trusted player in the data insights and data privacy space for our customers and for the advertisers who are clearly looking for a trusted partner in that space. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, John. Thanks for taking the questions. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So first question would be, if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on where we are kind of on the FirstNet go-to-market process? Have you stood up a sales force, if you have, what exactly are they selling and to who? And when can we think about the market share opportunity that you have there starting to feather into your kind of gross add market share and net add share in the market? And then the second is, a year ago, first quarter, the postpaid phone net add market was a couple hundred thousand phones. If we look at what you and Verizon and Comcast have done and make a few educated guesses about T-Mobile and Sprint, year over year, that's going to be 3x to 4x this quarter. And if I look at last quarter, it was actually up 50% year over year. What do you think is kind of driving this phenomenon where the postpaid phone net add market just seems kind of growing out of thin air? Is it the economy? Is it prepaid to postpaid migration? Is it BYOD? I'd love your thought \u2013 your theories here to kind of explain it. And then, whether we can maybe assume it's going to continue for the rest of the year or whether this is kind of transitory effect? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So I think it depends, David. I don't doubt. Let me say it this way. For us, we're both growing that improved postpaid phone, improved 300,000, while we still had almost 200,000 \u2013 I think it was about 192,000, but almost 200,000 prepaid net adds. So, for us, we're seeing continued good \u2013 really good performance in prepaid, but really good performance in the smartphone. So we're seeing a total growth in those phones. That's what we're seeing. I think others are seeing some conversion from prepaid to postpaid. I wouldn't \u2013 that may be at the customers' decision just based on pricing opportunities or, if you will, plans that are out there. But we are seeing continued growth in both for us. I do understand your question. And we'll wait and see about what happens with the total marketplace. I don't have a total view of that marketplace because I don't think anybody does because some of the company haven't announced and so forth. But in our, if you will, piece of the marketplace, you saw us now two quarters in a row over the last two quarters a 700,000 improvement in postpaid smartphones and continuing good performance, solid performance in prepaid. So we believe that we're doing very well in the share part of the game. I would also tell you there's other aspects of things in the postpaid net adds, as you all know, whether tablets are going, whether and how people count watches and other devices. I'll leave that to you all to decide and to evaluate. But on the phones, we feel pretty good about getting good value for the investment plans we put out there and a great opportunity to generate value, short-term, the month after, with regard to the revenues these guys are going to generate and over the long-term because of our churn being so low. With regard to FirstNet, FirstNet's something that we're really excited about. We're very excited about getting that, the only exclusive authorized FirstNet core up and running last month. We really do believe that that's critical to be able to provide the services and to provide that quality of service that those first responders deserve and need. We had set up a FirstNet team last year. An individual by the name of Chris Sambar runs that for us. We added marketing and staff and sales people. We've spent money, if you will, and time over the \u2013 at least over the last nine months, if not longer, almost a year, I guess, getting to know our potential clients, getting into the industry, making a bigger effort to be a known player. With regard to that, as I mentioned earlier, we've actually had about 600 or so, if you will, departments sign up with us. And those 600 departments came from over 48 states because they can use \u2013 we can provide the FirstNet quality services on our existing LTE network once we've established this core, which we did last month. So they can get relentless or ruthless pre-emption, and they can get priority services. And that can all work now. We can provide that. Now, some of those folks that we signed up could have been our customers before they just want to migrate to FirstNet and that'll be part of the process. But quite frankly, I think we've been very pleased about the reception we've been given to at least talk to people that previously weren't our customers. On a per person basis, if you will, some of your first line, first responder, you're thinking about two or three or potentially four connected points, whether it be a body camera, whether it be a phone, whether it be a tablet for their car, whether it would be some drone or some other device they'd use. But you also look at it from the ability to contact with the smart cities, their employer, so to speak, and whether we can sell other services there. We're also looking for the in-house personnel, the dispatch people that work at the police station or other personnel whether we can have an opportunity to sell there. And of course, there's always the friends and family approach. So we're very pleased. First of all, we've got a FirstNet team already set up. They're very active. They've already gotten a number of contracts done in over 40 states. And we continue to be very excited about it. We will get a significant amount of the Band 14 up this year, and we are expecting to, at a minimum, meet and hopefully exceed all the milestone requirements that FirstNet has given us. So if I sound pretty positive about it, I am. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Amy Yong of Macquarie. Your line is open. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the advertising opportunity and size up the near-term market opportunity for us. How quickly do you think you can wrap this up and then maybe some growth trends that we should be looking at for this year and next? And then just very quickly on the 5G fixed wireless trials, how big is the residential broadband marketing opportunity, as we think about 2019 and beyond? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: So on the advertising, let me start. I'd point out, this quarter we were up 9% in revenues. We have a base of about $350 million a quarter, in that range. I don't have the specific number at my fingertips here. And we grew at about 9%. So the team is actually proving that this works already with our existing, if you will, inventory of ads that we get as the distributor from the content folks. So we're making it work. We're getting higher CPMs and getting higher revenue streams and making it more effective. We feel really good about that. As we go through this year, we hope to add a lot more inventory from underneath our umbrella of ownership companies to that, and we'd like to develop that. If you think about the overall digital market, I don't know the exact numbers, but I think last year, the overall digital advertising market in the U.S. was north of $60 billion, and some estimates will get it in the $80 billion range. We're not what I would call in that piece a significant player. We believe that we can be. We have the capabilities to be. And we've made the investments not only in the personnel and the team that Brian Lesser has established, but we're also making investments in data capabilities and our big data engines inside our company today. So we feel really good about that opportunity. If you think about linear TV and the opportunity to grow that revenue stream, if you think about digital and the opportunity to grow that, and anything about the opportunity to take all of our digital insights and data insights and help advertisers make sure their advertising is working effectively and efficiently, we believe that there's a real opportunity there. So all of that being done within the appropriate rules and data protection activities. So we feel really good about that. With regard to the fixed 5G wireless, if you will, our tests have shown it can be done. We can do it. The opportunity there is something that we have to prove out. We're not as excited about the business case. It's not as compelling yet for us as it may be for some. The reason we don't see that, if you will. The question is to get that fixed wireless through to residential, you still have to have backhaul from where the \u2013 the 1,000 feet away, the 1,500 feet away, and you still have to have that backhaul infrastructure. So that could be depending upon your ability to successfully pick who's going to buy and how much we're going to need is going to be a very tricky business case. For us, with this extensive fiber network, we will be able to have that backhaul. With this extensive FirstNet network, we'll be able to have that backhaul. But quite frankly, if we've got FirstNet and we've got fiber there, it may be just as effective and maybe even a better quality product to give those customers fiber-to-the-home. So we're continuing to work at it. I just don't want to hold it out as \u2013 right now, we are more excited, as you can tell, from things I've made about our FirstNet opportunity, about the fiber capabilities that we're building and selling into that, and quite frankly, about the overall 5G Evolution and 5G capabilities in our overall mobility network serving much of the mobile broadband demands that are out there or requirements that are out there. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Amy. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Justin, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Last, we have the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Give us a little bit more color on maybe the free cash flow aspects in your Entertainment business as you're switching more to the DIRECTV NOW product. That would be great. And then on 5G, some of the devices being available late 2018, can you give us a little bit more color on exactly what devices you're waiting for before the launch? Thanks. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. With regard to the 5G, let me make this point. On the 5G Evolution, those devices are not only available now, many of our customers already have them. And so the speeds we get with 5G Evolution by putting up all our spectrum with regard to FirstNet, using 4-way carrier aggregation, which allows us to band the spectrum that we put up now all together, and having 4-way MIMO, which is, if you will, an efficient and quick way to let customers access the network and exit the network, those speeds are working today. And in our test in San Francisco, we got 750-meg speeds on our network. On a full network, that might be 10% to 20% of that level. But we believe we can get 100-meg speeds on our 5G Evolution network with handsets that are already out there today in people's hands, and they're coming through the rest of the handset manufacturer base over time. So I just want to point that out. That's one of the reasons why the FirstNet with the technology developments of carrier agg and 4-way MIMO and 256-QAM and all these other things combined as well as the new spectrum, Band 14, gives us real excitement about the ability to serve customers really, really well. On the 5G, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 5G networks up. The device that will be out will probably be pucks and the ability to connect to a puck. And then we'd expect to see what I'll call handset devices or tablets or those types of what I would \u2013 I think many of us would normally think of as devices. Those would be out in 2019. And as I think Simon referenced earlier in the call, we've got, if you will, upgrade cycles that are sub-5% a quarter. So there may be some time to getting those 5G handsets up and running, so to speak. So we'll see how that goes, whether that changes the upgrade cycles or not. But all of that for us points to this 5G Evolution can be a really beneficial thing for us because that's available in many, many handsets today. On the free cash flow side, if you will, Frank, I guess I'll say it this way. Moving to the DTV NOW platform or moving to a thin client platform eventually for the home is really going to change the free cash flow aspects because of the upfront of truck roll cost, the upfront, if you will, climb the roof costs, all of that can change as well as some of the things with regard to billing and administrative costs, the fact that it's an automatic bill or it's a credit card bill, all of those things will change. But that's one of the attractiveness is about the DTV NOW is the economics about not having that upfront investment. That will turn into savings from an upfront investment from a cash flow perspective. So that's why this thing we strongly believe it will work long term. With regard to our first quarter free cash flow \u2013 and we want to make one point. First of all, first quarter is always low for us because of bonuses and other things. We had a huge handset sales in the first \u2013 in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. 500,000 up year over year in the first quarter. 700,000 up year over year in the fourth quarter. And many of those sales in the fourth quarter, we actually paid for the phones this quarter because they were late in the quarter last year when they were sold. So we had a lot of cash flow pressure from handsets that will reverse itself that'll wash itself out. I just want to point that out. So we feel good about our free cash flow and keeping it in that $21 billion range is the guidance we've given as well as keeping all of our guidance intact. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you, Frank. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today. We're off to a fast start in 2018, both in growing our customer base and in building the world's premier gigabit network. We continue to add new subscribers in wireless, broadband and video, and we are on track to turn wireless service revenues towards growth this year. The FirstNet build is kicking in the gear, and we launched the nationwide FirstNet dedicated network core last month. We're working hard to build something great for first responders and early response from our sales activity has been very positive. We're also moving full speed on our 5G evolution and expect to be the first U.S. carrier to introduce Mobile 5G later this year. Behind all of this is our expanding fiber network, which is the backbone for all our networks, both wireless and wired. And of course, we optimistically await conclusion of our Time Warner court case as a court's decision. One last thought, as you make your way home tonight, please remember, no text is worth a life. It can wait. Please be safe. Thanks again for being on the call and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you very much for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the AT&T Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, Lori, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. As Lori said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. This is our first call - first earnings call after we closed our acquisition of Time Warner, and we're broadcasting this call from WarnerMedia headquarters in New York. As we told you earlier, we're going to use this call not only to discuss the quarter, but we're also going to provide more details on our strategy. And to do that, we've brought together the CEO, CFO and four business leaders of our business units. Today's agenda is going to begin with John Stephens, who will cover AT&T and Time Warner's second quarter financial results as well as update our outlook and guidance. Randall will provide a strategic perspective of the business. And then each of the business unit leaders will take -- will talk about their second quarter results and give a perspective of their businesses going forward. After that, the entire team will be available to participate in the Q&A session. I'd like to mention one save the date item. We plan host a sell-side meeting on the evening of November 29 and followed by a buy-side meeting that next morning on the 30th. Both would be here in New York, and all the folks on this call will join us for those meetings. So please mark your calendars, and more details to come. Now before I turn the call over to John, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today will be forward looking and as such is subject to risks, uncertainties. Results may differ materially. In addition, information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also need to remind you that we're in the quiet period from the FCC CAF-II auction, so we can't address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes the news release, 8-K, investor briefing, other associated schedules, and available on our website are materials on Warner Media's full second quarter. It includes trending schedule and other important documents. And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John Stephens : Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on Slide 5. I think most of you know the FASB has been very, very busy this past year implementing a number of accounting standards, five of which have direct impact on AT&T. Those include standards that deal with revenue recognition, pension reporting, impacts on cash flow reporting. These changes impact our income statements and cash flow. At the same time, the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees net as an offset to our regulatory fees. We're working hard to help you understand these changes. So in addition to the GAAP financial information, we're providing comparable historical results to help you better understand the impact on the financials from revenue recognition and the policy decisions, as well as Time Warner's second quarter results on a historical basis. We will be referring to these historical results in our comparisons during the call. Now let's start with EPS. We continue to show strong adjusted EPS growth, up more than 15% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Tax reform continues to have a positive impact on EPS as does the adoption of revenue recognition. We also had about $0.02 of help from the 16 days we own Time Warner, which we have renamed WarnerMedia. The WarnerMedia earnings contribution was slightly more than what you might expect for such a short period. But as you know, financial results can be uneven, and we saw that in the second quarter. Consolidated revenue came in at $39 billion, down slightly from a year ago, but that includes about $900 million of pressure from how we are now accounting for USF fees on a net basis. When you look on a comparable basis, revenues were up slightly, thanks mostly due to the two weeks of Time Warner revenue but also helped by gains in wireless and AdWorks. We continue to use our tax reform savings to invest in and grow our customer base. As John Donovan will discuss, these investments help drive post-paid phone growth and significant year-over-year improvement in prepaid phone net adds, continued growth in consumer broadband customers even in a seasonally challenging quarter and solid subscriber growth in total video customers. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year-over-year on a reported basis but down on a comparable one. Solid smartphone sales drove some of the pressure to margins, but the biggest factor continues to be customer transition to over-the-top video. Let's now look at free cash flow. It was a strong $5.1 billion for the quarter, up substantially both year-over-year and sequentially. Year-to-date, our cash from operations and free cash flow is up about $1.5 billion, which makes us very comfortable with our free cash flow guidance for the full year. Our cash flows also reflect the timing differences between spending for FirstNet and the reimbursements we received from the organization. This usually trail spending by several months. Year-to-date, that comes to more than $100 million of free cash flow pressure. Capital spending for the quarter was $5.1 billion or $5.4 billion before the $300 million of FirstNet reimbursements we did receive in the quarter. Let's now cover financial results from operations beginning on Slide 6. AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations. Our wireless business turned in very good results. Year-over-year service revenue turned positive. Margins remained strong, and we had phone growth in both post-paid and pre-paid. Total revenues were up year-over-year, thanks to gains in both service and equipment revenues. Also, service revenues were up almost 2% sequentially. Strong sales in BYOD supported that growth. Our upgrade rate was down year-over-year, but our equipment revenues were up, reflecting customers' purchasing habits and their choice of more expensive devices. But even with these strong sales, margins were very good with service margins coming in over 50% on a comparable basis. Looking ahead, we expect positive service revenue growth for the full year on a comparable basis. Turning to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see the impact of the video transition in our revenues and our margins. This would take a while to work through, and we expect it to continue the rest of the year. But we are seeing some sequential stability in both revenues and margins. We're making changes to drive revenues and effectively manage the transition. We're going to introduce some promotional pricing that impacted revenues in the past, and we now have new features on our next-generation platform that will drive additional revenue opportunities such as cloud DVR, a more robust VOD experience with new pay-per-view options and an additional stream capability. John Donovan is going to walk you through those plans in a few minutes. Also helping is AdWorks, which continues to grow at a double-digit rate and has now an annualized revenue stream of over $1.8 billion. Moving to our Business Solutions group. Revenues were down as gains in wireless and strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy services. Business wireless with strong growth, up more than 4%. This is driven by both equipment and service revenues. Wireline revenues were down more than 4% year-over-year. We still expect tax reform to produce a lift in communication spend, but we just haven't seen it yet. Wireline EBITDA margins were up slightly on a comparable basis. Cost efficiencies continue to offset pressure from legacy products and our investments in FirstNet. In our International business, solid customer performance helped to offset currency pressures. Revenues were stable year-over-year, while margins were pressured by World Cup expenses as well as foreign exchange. Now let's look at Time Warner's second quarter financials on Slide 7. Time Warner had strong growth at all operating conditions on a comparable basis. This includes strong subscription revenue growth on both Turner and HBO. Turner also showed solid advertising revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, driven by increases at Warner and HBO. Now for some housekeeping items. With recent FASB accounting rules, the Time Warner merger and purchase price accounting rules, there's going to be a lot of new information included in our results. We're going to do our best to make that easy for you to understand. First, we'll file pro formas with the SEC in August. Second, we have posted the full second quarter results for Time Warner on our Investor Relations website. This includes the Time Warner historical results, trending schedules, all the information you're accustomed to seeing. Finally, as you're updating your models, keep in mind the following : Results will continue to be reported at the divisional level, but there are certain things that will be eliminated in the Corporate and Other segment, including about $3 billion of annual inter-company content revenues and purchase accounting impacts on customer base and deferred production costs. We're very excited that Time Warner is part of the AT&T family and the WarnerMedia as part of the AT&T family, and John Stankey is going to provide more insights and highlights in a few minutes. Now let's look at our 2018 outlook with Time Warner included. We're raising adjusted earnings per share growth to the upper end of the $3.50 range with WarnerMedia included. Year-to-date, we're already seeing 15% growth. Impact of tax reform, improving wireless service and advertising revenues as well as the addition of Time Warner support strong adjusted EPS growth even with the additional shares issued as part of the deal. Looking at free cash flow. Our free cash flow guidance at the beginning of the year was standalone. We expect most of the benefit of the Time Warner free cash flow for the last half of the year, about $2 billion, will be absorbed by integration and deal costs, including severance costs, retention incentives, legal fees, bankers' costs and interest expense prior to close. When you consider those items and slightly lower cash capital spending, we're raising expected free cash flow to the upper end of the $21 billion range with dividend coverage in the low 60% range, and that's even with the additional shares and dividend responsibility from the merger with Time Warner. Now that we are halfway through the year, we also have a better view of CapEx. Capital investment is expected to be in the $25 billion range, but that will be $22 billion of CapEx on our cash flow statements after you net out our FirstNet reimbursements and some of the vendor financing opportunities that our team has pursued. A primary focus for us this year and the next few years is deleveraging the business. We have a strong business that generates a ton of cash and EBITDA, and we are very confident in the deleveraging targets that we have given you. Let me recap them now. Net debt to EBITDA is projected to be in the 2.9x range by the end of this year and a 2.5 range by the end of next year. To reach that target, we expect EBITDA growth. We'll use excess cash to pay down debt, and as always, we'll continue to look for ways to monetize non-strategic assets. You've seen that recently with the data center deal and our pending sale of broadcast 600 spectrum. We expect to return to historic debt levels in the 1.8 times range by the end of 2022. That's the financial summary. Now I'll turn it over to Randall. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, John. And it was an exciting quarter. After 600 days of reviews and litigation, we did finally complete the acquisition of Time Warner. And then just a few days later, we announced our agreement to acquire AppNexus. And if you're not familiar with AppNexus, it's one of the top ad technology companies around. And as John mentioned, we've renamed Time Warner to WarnerMedia, so we'll be referring to that as WarnerMedia from here forward. And as John Stankey will cover later, they had a really strong second quarter. We couldn't be pleased -- more pleased with the condition Jeff left the company with us. We've now assembled the key elements of a modern media company, and it all begins with owning a wide array of premium content because we are absolutely convinced that there is nothing that drives customer engagement like high-quality premium content. And whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney or Comcast, everybody is now pursuing the same thing. How do you deliver great media and entertainment experiences to our customers? And I think the recent valuations of media companies is reinforcing this point. But we couldn't be any happier with the range and quality of brands that we now own. For life programming, it doesn't get any better than CNN for news. And for sports, we have the NBA, March Madness, NFL SUNDAY TICKET, Major League Baseball and PGA. And for original premium subscription content, there is nobody better than HBO. Our cable networks at Turner are among the best, and they're performing well. And for content creation, our production studio at Warner Bros. is the gold standard, and they possess one of the deepest IP libraries around. And when you talk about digital content, we now own the cnn.com digital brands, and these are the most visited websites in the world. And add Bleacher Report and the Otter Media properties, and we have what we think are a terrific set of digital assets. Bottom line, we absolutely love this portfolio. But just owning great content is no longer sufficient. The modern media company must develop extensive direct-to-consumer relationships, and we think pure wholesale business models for media companies will be really tough to sustain over time. And when you look across our wireless, pay TV and our broadband businesses, we now have more than 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships. And these relationships are critical as we begin developing new media experiences for all kinds of different audiences. And then the 170 million relationships provide invaluable insights for new advertising models, and that's exactly what's behind our investment in ad technology. Today, we use our data insights. We deliver ads on DIRECTV. And when we do this, our advertising yields improve by 3 to 5x. As you're going to hear from Brian Lesser shortly, that business grew 16% in the second quarter. Now Turner has an ad inventory that's 3 times the size of our DIRECTV inventory, and as we apply the same data to that inventory, we expect a significant lift. At AppNexus, that acquisition is all about improving our capabilities and reducing our time to market here. So you take these three elements, premium content, 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships and great ad technology and then you combine those with our high-speed networks, and we think all of this is a game changer. Bringing these four elements together has changed the way we think about our customer value proposition. We spend our time now thinking about how to combine these elements to create unique customer experiences. How do we combine the best content wherever you are and make it easy to find and consume? What are the new products that combine content and connectivity? How do we create personalized content experiences, including personalized ads that you find useful? So hopefully, you begin to see why we're so excited about putting all of these capabilities together. Now we knew the WarnerMedia deal was not going to be like any other we had done. It's a vertical bolt on with a media business. And the media business obviously has very distinct culture, talent and business models. So last fall, in anticipation of the merger, we reorganized the company into 4 separate businesses, and you can see those on the next slide. What we've done is pushed the core staff functions and the decision-making out into the business units, and we left behind a very small staff at corporate. And this is all about increasing speed and efficiency at each of these businesses. But at the same time, we need to foster cross-platform coordination to generate the synergies that John Stankey will be touching on next. Today, we're going to change the earnings call around a little bit as John Stephens pointed out. We're going to give you a chance to hear from each of these business unit leaders. And then when they finish, we're going to stay on the phone and answer any questions that you have. And then John Stankey is going to lead us off. John is the Head of WarnerMedia. And then you're going to next hear from John Donovan, who heads up AT&T Communications; and then Brian Lesser, he's the Head of our Advertising & Analytics business. And he's going to walk you through his plans. And then finally, you'll hear from Lori Lee, who heads up our Latin American businesses. And she's going to take you through an update on, really, the great market momentum that we're experiencing in Mexico and also talk about the latest on our Latin American TV business. So with that, I'm now going to hand it over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Randall. Good afternoon to all of you. I've been on the job now a little bit more than a month, but during the time, I've had the opportunity to meet with various leadership teams at WarnerMedia. And I don't think it's a surprise to any of you what I found is what I believe to be an unmatched dedication to producing unique and engaging content across film, television, sports and journalism. Looking forward to my continued work with this team, and I think we have the great opportunities in front of us to further harness the exceptional content and capabilities at WarnerMedia. John gave you the financial highlights of WarnerMedia's second quarter, but let me dig in deeper, and you'll see those results on Slide 13. Time Warner's last quarter as a stand-alone company had strong revenue gains in Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. Turner saw solid growth with gains in both subscription and advertising revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from higher domestic rates and growth at Turner's international networks. Subscriber counts have been stable thanks to growth in virtual MVPDs with 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable networks among adults 18 to 49 in primetime. The Turner Networks are proving popular in every video bundle as evidenced by their inclusion in every major live OTT provider. Turner Sports properties helped drive strong advertising revenue growth in the second quarter led by the NBA on TNT broadcast. HBO also delivered solid revenue growth in the quarter. Subscriber revenues were up 13% due to strong U.S. subscriber growth and gains in international markets. Higher television revenues helped drive strong revenue growth at Warner Bros., Warner Bros. TV looks to build on that success with more than 75 TV series in production for the 2018, '19 season. That is the studio's largest number of TV series in production at one time ever. Here's another good indicator of what kind of quarter and year WarnerMedia has had. WarnerMedia companies, HBO, Turner, Warner Bros. received 166 Emmy nominations, which include 22 nominations for HBO's Game of Thrones alone, followed by 21 nominations for Westworld, which is produced for HBO by Warner Bros., a real trooper for us. These nominations speak to the caliber of the talent and dedication to quality across the company. My congratulations go to the entire WarnerMedia team for their exceptional creative achievements. During the roughly six weeks since we closed the deal on June 14, we've been working strategically to integrate the two companies. That includes applying the data analytics from AT&T's distribution to the Turner ad inventory. As you know, this is one of the benefits of combining our two businesses. You've seen the success of the AdWorks group using targeted advertising for DIRECTV and U-verse. Now we have 3x the ad inventory to work with. We believe we can get meaningful CPM improvement in what Turner sees today. Brian Lesser will explain in a few minutes. We expect this is only the beginning of our success. We've also moved quickly to position WarnerMedia content on AT&T distribution platforms. We intend to push the WarnerMedia consumer brands even further across all platforms. We've been busy with the basic blocking and tackling that comes with any merger, integrating corporate and staff functions, getting our infrastructure systems to work together and aligning corporate management. We'll look to achieve synergies with our advertising spend and other procurement areas by getting better rates from vendors and suppliers. For example, AT&T was not the primary telecom supplier for Time Warner. Now we begin that transition for WarnerMedia. These types of efforts will help us to deliver on the $2.5 billion in merger synergies we promised. While all this has been going on, we've been very deliberate in shaping some long-term initiatives that we think will add even greater value. We developed thoughtful plans on where we want to go next with WarnerMedia and have several goals that we want to accomplish. First, we want to increase our investment in premium content. HBO's name is synonymous with quality entertainment. The creative talent at HBO is the best in the industry. My goal is to give the HBO team the resources to greenlight additional projects already in the development funnel. We want to invest more in original content while still retaining the high quality and unique brand position of HBO. This will further strengthen the HBO brand, enhance the customer experience, improve churn and drive more engagement with some of our most valued customers. Second, we plan to further develop and nurture our direct-to-consumer distribution, including HBO NOW. That will include enhancing existing platforms as well as delivering premium content to the more than 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships across AT&T's video, mobile and broadband platforms in the United States and Latin America. We also plan to add even greater value to these relationships by focusing, aggregating and incorporating more WarnerMedia intellectual property. And third, we also are looking at our international markets and explore ways to maximize our content globally to create greater value. We believe there's a lot of opportunity that remains in this area. Obviously, we're very early in the game when it comes to implementing our plans, but we're off to a good start and look to quicken the pace as we move past close. Now I'd like to turn it over to John Donovan for details on AT&T's Communications second quarter results. John? John Donovan : Thanks, John. I'm really excited about WarnerMedia coming into our portfolio because it strengthens our ability to innovate across our businesses like content and content -- I'm sorry, connectivity. So if we discuss AT&T Communications operating results, we'll start on Slide 16. Our wireless business turned in an impressive quarter. John Stephens told you about the service revenue growth and strong margins, but we also had strong subscriber gains and continued our low post-paid culture. For the quarter, we added 46,000 post-paid phones. That makes nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. We had our best prepaid quarter in nine quarters with 453,000 prepaid net adds. This includes 356,000 phone net adds. We had a record connected device net add quarter as well, adding 3 million new devices. Churn continues to run at near-record low levels. Post-paid phone churn was 0.82%, just three basis points higher than last year's all-time record, and we have a record low prepaid churn, thanks to our multi-line plan penetration and auto bill pay. These customer gains and low churn are showing up in our service revenue, where we turned positive both sequentially and year-over-year on a comparative basis. With the unlimited launch well behind us and targeted promotional activity, we saw service revenue improve each month in the quarter, and we're on track to grow service revenue for the full year on a comparable basis. And we maintained comparable service margins above 50% again this quarter. Moving over to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see total video subscriber gains as we move through the transition of our video business. We had 80,000 total video net adds in the quarter with gains in DTV Now and U-verse more than offsetting losses in DIRECTV. We also turned in solid broadband gains. Our Entertainment Group had 76,000 IP broadband net adds with 23,000 total broadband net adds. That's their seventh consecutive quarter of broadband growth. About 95% of our consumer broadband base is now on our IP broadband as our transition from DSL is drawing to a close. Our fiber build continues at a fast clip, now passing more than 9 million customer locations, and we expect that this time next year to reach 14 million locations. This gives us a long runway for broadband growth. We're doing very well in our fiber markets, including a 246,000 net increase in subs on our fiber network in the second quarter. Now I'd like to update you on several key initiatives we have underway, so we'll turn to Slide 17. Evolving our video portfolio is top priority for us. We believe we're well positioned as our customers move toward a more personalized set of streaming products. Our new platform was launched in May as the DIRECTV NOW user interface, and it's now live on all supported device operating systems and has been well received with strong engagement by customers. It offers a new cloud-based DVR and more robust video-on-demand experience with new pay-per-view options. Over time, it will bring additional advertising and data insight opportunities. This new video platform gives us flexibility to adapt to the market with new offerings and products. Late in the quarter, we added our third video offering called WatchTV, a small package of 30 live channels and 15,000 on-demand titles. We include WatchTV in our unlimited, more wireless plans where you can purchase it for $15 a month, making it perfect for customers who want video but not at the cost of a large package. This complements DIRECTV NOW where we continue to see success in attracting cord cutters and cord severs. And later this year, we will begin testing a premium product extension, which is a streaming product that will give the full DIRECTV experience over any broadband, ours or competitors'. It will have additional benefits of an improved search and discovery feature and an enhanced user interface. We're excited that this will complement our top-end product for those who don't want or can't have a satellite dish. Our open-video platform also dovetails nicely with our ongoing focus on driving the industry's leading cost structure. The new platform is low touch with lower acquisition costs as streaming services becomes a bigger part of our business. Digital sales are a cost-efficient way of customer engagement, and we're seeing double-digit growth in our digital sales and service. We're also seeing operating expense savings from our move to a virtualized software-defined network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, and we're well on our way to meet or exceed our goal of 75% virtualized by 2020. These and other cost management initiatives have helped drive 13 straight quarters of cost reductions in our technology and infrastructure group. Finally, I'd like to give an update on our FirstNet build and other network investments. Our FirstNet network build is accelerating. We expect to have between 12,000 and 15,000 band 14 sites on air by the end of this year 2018, and we're ahead of our contractual commitment. And don't forget, when we're putting in equipment for FirstNet, we're also deploying our AWS and WCS spectrum, utilizing the one touch, one tower approach. This approach allows all customers access to our improved network. FirstNet also gives us an opportunity to sell to first responders. So far, more than 1,500 public safety agencies across 52 states and territories have joined FirstNet, nearly doubling the network's adoption since April. In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work continues its development in several different areas that will pave the way to the next generation of higher speeds for our customers. We now have 5G Evolution in more than 140 markets, covering nearly 100 million people with theoretical peak speeds of at least 400 megabits per second with plans to cover 400-plus markets by the end of this year. Our millimeter wave mobile 5G trials are also going well, and we're on track to launch service in parts of 12 markets by the end of this year. With that, I now turn it over to Brian Lesser to discuss our Advertising & Analytics business. Brian? Brian Lesser : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As Randall mentioned, a critical component of the modern media company is a dynamic advertising business, one that can deliver on the promise of making advertising relevant, engaging and actually matter to consumers and make it work harder for advertisers and make it more valuable and optimized for publishers. I think about this simply. The course of the ad industry has been set by a series of defining moments. The rise of broadcast networks, the proliferation of cable networks and the pay TV bundle, digital advertising and its ability to target audiences, we sit here again today at yet another point that will define advertising for years to come. The pain points are obvious. Traditional advertising doesn't satisfy what both consumers and brands are looking for. Brands are frustrated with lack of access to data, lack of competence in targeting and measurement and non-transparent ad tech costs. The industry talked about video convergence, but no tangible examples yet have emerged to deliver a unified buy-side and sell-side platform. So while the timing for disrupting the ad industry is right, you must have the assets to execute, and there is no doubt that AT&T is uniquely positioned to lead this disruption. In our view, successful ad marketplaces must have two key assets : number one, its premium content. Sports, news, original programming, we love our position with Turner content along with the scaled portfolio of ad inventory. Number two is distribution. Customers dictate how and where they consume content. Likewise, a relevant ad marketplace must be able to reach customers where they are, whether it's a 50-foot screen in a theater or a 3-inch screen in your pocket. Number three is data. AT&T has access to expansive datasets on customer behavior and preferences. 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships across its wireless video and broadband businesses, 40 million set-top boxes, 20 million connected cars, and that's just for starters. But data needs to be activated to have value. We're building targeting and measurement capabilities that will bring greater value to consumers, advertisers and publishers. And number four is technology. Content distribution and data must be integrated on a best-in-class ad technology platform. That's the rationale for our recent announcement to acquire AppNexus. This is a best-in-class independent advertising marketplace supported by the best talent in the industry. We cannot wait to combine our teams and partner to make advertising matter to consumers. It is important to note we are not starting from a standstill. Both AT&T Advertising & Analytics and Turner have executed fabulously by using data and technology to fuel growth. AT&T Advertising & Analytics is consistently delivering double-digit revenue growth, including 16% growth in the second quarter. We will employ the same momentum and scale to deliver on our vision. So in closing, our plan is nothing short of leading the industry and creating a premium advertising marketplace across both TV and digital by quickly integrating AT&T assets, including AppNexus. It's this unique moment in time, coupled with this unique set of assets, that gives me confidence in our path forward. With that, I will hand it over to Lori Lee to talk about our Latin American operation. Lori Lee : Thank you, Brian. The advertising opportunities that Brian laid out apply to Latin America as well. We have more than 30 million direct-to-consumer relationships, and we plan to run the same play with the LatAm business that we will be using in the United States. It won't happen overnight, but the opportunity is definitely there. Let me discuss our second quarter results. Those details are on Slide 21. Starting with our Mexico Wireless operations, we turned in another strong subscriber quarter with more than 750,000 net adds. That totaled more than 3 million new customers in the past 12 months, doubling our subscriber base to a 16.4 million since entering Mexico just 3 years ago. During that time, we've built a world-class LTE network and developed a marketing presence reflecting the AT&T brand. Our network build is in the final stages as we close in on covering 100 million people. We have rebranded 3,000 stores and have approximately 6,000 total retail locations, expanding our marketing presence and distribution. And we've upgraded and integrated our different billing systems. All this puts us in a great position to add customers and revenues at a lower cost. We're also making a lot of progress in improving our financials. Operationally, we're pushing on all fronts to exit the year EBITDA positive. In our Vrio pay-TV business, currency devaluations have impacted our financial results, but the strength of our subscriber base and our profitability remains consistent. That continued to be true in the second quarter. The World Cup drove strong subscriber growth of 140,000 with particularly strong gains in prepaid. We finished the quarter with 13.7 million pay-TV subscribers, a number that has held fairly steady since we acquired the business. The World Cup did drive higher expenses in the quarter, but we continue to drive profitability and positive free cash flow year-to-date. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, Lori. Lori - operator Lori, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Thanks. And I think I'm going to bounce around a little bit. But maybe first for John Donovan, the wireless business, it looks like EBITDA was down about 0.7%, I think, on like-for-like basis. But obviously, you returned to growth in subscribers and some margin improvement. Should we be expecting that segment still your biggest [ph] to return to EBITDA growth as we look forward? And then maybe one for Brian and then for John Stankey. Brian, we've heard a lot about addressable advertising, 3% growth this quarter on the advertising line. What are some of the milestones that we should expect and maybe the timing of when this addressable advertising opportunity starts to take hold within these numbers? And then lastly, John Stankey, the - you obviously got some press recently in terms of interview you did about the new WarnerMedia. Could you talk a little bit about the size of that HBO spend? I think the HBO spends about $2 billion. You're competing with companies that spend $8 billion a year, much bigger numbers. I mean, how should we think of that in terms of the overall financial profile of the company? And maybe if you could elaborate on other D-to-C efforts you may have. We've heard about DC -- DC Universe and the HBO NOW but if there's any other sort of initiatives we should be looking for? Thanks. John Donovan : Hey, John, it's John Donovan. I'll start the question on wireless and EBITDA. We've had now three quarters in a row where our year-over-year compares on subscriber growth was very good. We crossed over that all-important date, where we got a lot of the reseller stuff behind us. We crossed over that date for the unlimited plans. And you've seen a lot of momentum in prepaid, which has really become a really nice business for us right now. We're in a really good rhythm there firing on all cylinders. And so what we're seeing right now in this quarter, John mentioned in his opening remarks that we were stronger each month of the quarter within the quarter. We're starting to see us roll over some of those earlier events, and now we're beginning to get strength in them. And so because we - in the - each month of this quarter strengthened from subscriber counts, we also have some pricing moves, calibration of pricing, if you will, that made us consistent with our value proposition in the marketplace. So we expect that we'll have growth for the year and the EBITDA margins to improve. Brian Lesser : John, I'll take the next part of your question. This is Brian Lesser. So you asked about milestones in the advertising business. I think it's important to know that we have posted a $2 billion advertising business outside of what we just acquired in Turner, and that advertising business was growing 16% in the second quarter. So we're already showing the value of data and technology on our advertising business. I think in terms of going forward, you should look for some things that we've already mentioned here in this call, number one, our ability to increase the yield on the inventory that we have now within Turner and WarnerMedia more broadly and also increase value to the firm but also value to publishers, advertisers and the consumers. You'll see us continue to develop the ad platform. AppNexus, once we close that deal, is an important milestone for us, but you'll see us lean in and develop additional technologies around that platform. And then third is our ability to partner with other media companies outside of AT&T. In some ways, our success will depend on our ability to attract additional sources of inventory to reach critical mass for advertisers. John Stankey : So John, let me just amplify the last piece that Brian gave. Data that we have had within the AT&T company applying to AdWorks has already been moved over into the Turner team to begin applying into existing inventory that we have using the same techniques we piloted in selling the two minutes of advertising that the AT&T team has across the broader inventory of Turner. So that's near term. That's not a milestone issue. That's, today, we're starting to look at those business cases and how we would do that. Teams have already come up with a variety of different initiatives around that, including - we found out that Brian had a great opportunity to do addressable advertising in the pharmaceutical space, and some of the pharmaceutical companies wanted 90-second avails. And he didn't have 90 seconds of inventory. So we're bridging Turner inventory with what used to be AT&T inventory so that we can have new addressable products to bring in. So that's - there's benefit to that data that's occurring now even without the broad mechanization and intelligence and platform work that Brian brought to the table that's just discussed. So on direct to consumer, what I will tell you is what we know about this space is it requires scale. And you mentioned that there's a number of different initiatives underway within the WarnerMedia companies, and they're all good within their own right. But they all generate what I would consider to be relatively small scale audiences, company our size. We want to be generating audience. It's in the tens of millions, not in the single-digits millions. And so the way I would think about our direct-to-consumer efforts over time is it's better together. So a lot of very strong brands in the family that generate interest among groups of audiences and on a stand-alone basis, they're not as powerful as they are when they're brought together. And you can assemble the genre of content and bring them together on one platform and one experience that aggregates and gets scale. So over time, what you should think about how we're going to approach the discrete brands that we have is ultimately unify them in a more consistent and more focused experience. It starts to bring some scale in. Still very important properties, they still need to be developed. We've got to get the formula right for them, but over time, we want to strengthen them to come together. In terms of your reference to the new cycles on HBO, it wasn't an interview. I think it was an internal discussion that was right to act, but I would tell you, I don't believe in it effectively characterizing what we are about. What we are about, as I said, is we have a tremendous amount of great projects already in the funnel that as the HBO team and Richard would describe it, they have not been in a position to say yes to because of constraints on certain resources. What we're attempting to do is open up those constraints on very high, top-quality projects that we think will balance out the schedule so that we have a more engaging experience with HBO throughout the course of the year. That will improve the fact that we can see, especially on the digital platforms, you have customers jumping in and out based on scheduling. And if we can smooth that schedule, we can drive churn down or improve retention and power additional subscriber growth. So I'm not going to give you the exact investment number, but the way I would think about it is we will make decisions to reinvest some of the efficiencies that we pick up from combining these companies together and running them at a little different fashion. We may get back a margin point or so in the near term as we grow the subscriber base as we reinvest in it. But it's going to be a very responsible investment and great projects we've already scoped out, we already have rights for, we want to get into the development funnel. And the team feels very, very comfortable that we can flex up on our development in a way that we think rounds out the schedule very nicely. Randall Stephenson : John, this is Randall. It - well, this merger is different in terms it's a vertical merger. There are certain aspects of the playbook that you just heard John describe that they're going to be exactly the same in that it generates synergies and then reinvest significant portion of those synergies back in to your capabilities and your products. Direct to consumer and deeper HBO content, it's just part and parcel to that. That's no different to what we've done in the past, and you should probably expect it's going to happen here as well. Thanks for your question. Lori, we\u2019ll take the next question. Operator : And we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. For John Stephens, John, in the past, you'd given some guidance with DIRECTV on the medium term on EPS. Can you give us any color about the benefits of Time Warner or WarnerMedia in a full year '19? How should we be thinking about that given the upside to guidance this year? And then on the balance sheet, what are you assuming in terms of getting 2.5 around additional divestitures and about things like spectrum acquisitions? Or is that just run rate with what you have right now? Thanks. John Stephens : A couple of things, Simon. Thanks for the questions. First of all, beginning to - on the 2.5x by the end of next year, that's driven mainly by run rate with regard to cash flows, taking the cash flows above the dividend and paying down debt. Secondly, it is important to achieve the synergies, particularly the EBITDA boosting synergies and the growth that we're seeing and some of the growth that we're seeing in wireless and customer additions so that we get a higher EBITDA number. Well, we have normally planned for asset sales and constantly look at underutilized assets for monetization, for example, the data centers, the broadcast spectrum 600, which is a couple of billion dollars right there, we have under contract and waiting for approvals today. We'll continue to do that. If you want to give a scope to it, as of today, we have about $500 billion in total assets. And so finding a few more opportunities to monetize assets seems to be very reasonable on top of the things that we've kind of commonly done with regard to real estate and other underutilized business in spectrum. So that batch [ph], I'm not giving you any specific number on asset sales, but as we've proven this year, we're going to continue to do that. And with regard to EPS guidance specifically around the acquisition, I'll say it this way. First and foremost, the point is, is that WarnerMedia -- Time Warner, WarnerMedia, immediately accretive. Revenues, free cash flow, EPS, we've seen it already. So that guidance that we've given, we'd expect we're standing by that and continue to expect that and have started to prove that out already. Secondly, we're not going to give a specific guidance with regard to Time Warner's impacts, but I'd suggest it this way. If you think about $3.50 EPS range, for us, that means $3.40 to $3.60. And we just said that we expect to be in the high end of that range. So that'll give you an indication of using your own estimates, other's estimates, where we were, what we expected to be for the rest of the year. I will point out that the $0.02 we've got in the second quarter for two weeks was, as I said, uneven, and specifically because the NBA contract for playoffs, all that content was extended before we merged. The Golden State Warriors won the championship in June 8, so that content expense was recognized before we got the deal. So we have some higher profitability in those 16 days you might otherwise expect. But I'd expect profitability to continue no matter what. We'll give specific EPS guidance for '19 in the coming months. I would just suggest that we continue to expect this transaction to be accretive, revenue, free cash flow and EPS. Randall Stephenson : Lori, we\u2019ll take the next question Operator : We go to Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please proceed. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Seems like we're going around in the same questions. But one for Brian. Can you talk about - clearly, what has to be done here to realize the addressable ad vision? And what's the timing of this coming through to accelerate the numbers and start to be really material on the company? Can this impact 2019 or are we really talking about 2020? And how do you see the potential to reduce the ad load while you raise CPMs? Thanks. Brian Lesser : In terms of - thanks for the question, Phil. In terms of timing, as John Stankey outlined, there are some things that we can do immediately and start to add value to Turner ad inventory, and that's already in motion. And so we think there's short-term value there in 2018. I would say in terms of the overall addressable opportunity, that's a little bit further out. We have work to do in terms of building the technology platform, but the good news there is because of the amount of inventory that exists within DIRECTV, also within WarnerMedia, we can prove out the value of AT&T data and the investments that we're making in technology plus the evolution of our direct-to-consumer relationship that John Donovan talked about. So I think we still keep our losses [ph] to really start to extract value from inside AT&T using our inventory across DIRECTV and WarnerMedia in 2018. And then in 2019, we're going to start to partner very effectively across other sources of inventory to bring value. John Stephens : Phil, John Stephens, if I could add to that. I mean, want to point out Brian's humble here in that sense that he started getting 16% revenue growth on those ads, DIRECTV, U-verse footprint, possibility, those ads watched by the same people as the ones who watch the Turner ads. So we've got proof then this works. Secondly, when the AppNexus deal closes, we'll have the ability to take our internal activity and put it on that supply-side platform that will be within our control. So we are optimistic about the opportunities to get value out of the AppNexus platform. We've got DOJ approved forward. We're going to need to get [indiscernible] approved and hope to close it before the next time we speak certainly. But I'm optimistic about that, too, so probably a lot of things going and heading in the right direction. Phil Cusick : And in terms of the ad load? Thank you. Brian Lesser : In terms of the ad load, so our objective, Phil, is not just to improve advertising as it exists today but to also improve the experience for consumers. We're in a unique position to do that because of our vertical integration because we have content and we have that direct-to-consumer relationship over a traditional television, over a mobile phone, over other mobile devices. We can start to do things in terms of innovating the ad experience. As an example, you'll see us start to introduce products across the rest of this year and obviously, the next year, where the consumer watching television has a better experience that is less interruptive. Imagine a DIRECTV customer watching the big screen on their living room wall and instead of seeing a traditional ad break, they see an icon on a car in a movie that they're interested in or in a show that they're interested in. And then we have the ability to create a seamless ad experience on their mobile device, which is on the coffee table or in their pocket, pause real-time content to interact with a better ad experience and therefore, deliver more relevant content to our customer and to the consumer more broadly. That has the ability, number one, to be a better experience for our customers and consumers, a better business for us because those ad units will generate a higher CPM and a higher yield and a better experience for advertisers and the media company representing the content. So that's really our objective, is to start to innovate because of our access to data technology and the direct-to-customer relationship. John Stankey : I would -- Phil, I would just comment that this notion of more innovative ad formats is critical. It's not just a lighter ad load. Well, that's important, and we'd like to achieve it. I think what we all understand is that viewing habits are moving away, in many instances, from the linear fee, and so my a goal working with distributors such as my partner here at the table who is a large distributor of my product is just also start to take these better software-driven platforms that they have and lay out more on-demand content for them that allows for what used to be linear content to be available and stacked and other formats and then attach to that the right kind of advertising that isn't loading that on-demand content with the same commercial loads but is also highly targeted and customized to the particular experience that the individual is going through. We saw how mobilizing and moving to TV Everywhere raised consumption of the traditional linear affair. I think we have another opportunity to take a fairly mature pay-TV product and extend the runway even further by being more aggressive in trying to incent the distributors to carry more depth in a library. Randall Stephenson : Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : We go to John Janedis with Jefferies. John Janedis : Thank you. One for John Stankey. Maybe a follow-up on HBO. As you know, domestic subs have been in the 30 million to maybe 35 million or so range over the past few years. And you talked about the content investment. But will there be a more aggressive direct-to-consumer push that perhaps would include maybe a Turner bundle or maybe a change to more wholesale deals with existing distributors? And is there any consideration to reset the price, which has largely remained steady as many of your peers have been more promotional? Thank you. John Stankey : So I would tell you that our wholesale distributors remain a really important part of our product, and we want to make the product better to improve its performance for their businesses as well as the HBO brand overall. And as I indicated, we'd like to, for example, improve our term characteristics by getting a more complete annual schedule that has people fully incented to stay in the product and not jump in and out of it as various content comes and goes through the course of the year. We think we've got some good steps that we can take in that regard that will help our sub counts and continue to grow through our traditional distribution channel. I do believe that as we invest in the platform itself, the direct-to-consumer platform and improve some of the technical capabilities associated with it that our features that can be brought to bear in a typical OTT SVOD environment, that we can also increase the distribution of the digital versions of the product that go direct on retail. And so we want to run that play as well. I will tell you that I don't think that's a -- what I would call right now a step function change over the next couple of months, but we can incrementally get better on our current run rates by having some success in that regard. In terms of what other content can be paired with HBO and maybe a more broad offer, I think we have a number of distributors out there that have some great ideas around how they might want to match HBO to their particular content offerings. And as I said, I want to look at the depth of our WarnerMedia offerings that we have and get better together and understand how we can bring some of our WarnerMedia brands and our other curated options into a more focused direct-to-consumer strategy that I think, as we start to get our strategy together on that, move forward on it, you could see that step function increase in more retail oriented customers. John Janedis : Thanks, John. Randall Stephenson : Take the next question operator. Operator : And we go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks. One of the stronger trends we saw in this quarter was a nice improvement in postpaid phone ARPU, and actually, some of your peers, we've seen something similar so far this quarter. Also, if we look at the market and we look at some of the pricing moves you've made and others have made, there's an introduction of higher price points. It's not really price increases, but it's really just if you pay more, you'll get more. So I was hoping maybe you could just expand in terms of what your customers are asking for, why you've identified a cohort that has shown a willingness to pay more for more. And how durable do you think this trend might be? John Donovan : Yes. Brett, you've been obviously watching our commercials. That whole idea and more. And so what we're trying to do is differentiate the product in ways that don't have to do with speeds, megabytes or rack rate pricing. And so what we're really focused on is product engagement. The value of any customer will be based on the combination of the price and the value that they use for. And that's why I would say, from a consumer perspective, our strength in consumer has been heavily in the bundling of video with wireless. So we see increased engagement. We're finding that people find a lot of value for it, and then we're kind of spreading the offers to fit budgets and engagement. And so you've seen that in wireless. And I would point out to you that, that pattern may look familiar in video, and we're trying to find various price points, engagements and content combinations that fit everybody's budget so that everybody views that they're getting value. And they do that not just by focusing on megabytes and pricing. So I think that it's not an accidental trend that we stumbled onto. It's actually a strategy that's centered in the DIRECTV merger that we were pushing in, and that fits very well with this next step with WarnerMedia. And our sister over there provides us a lot of flexibility. So I do think it's a trend. I do think that if we succeed - when we succeed, others will be -- will follow and make some of the moves in their own. And I think that right now we see the most important thing, which was engagement and customer delight for the product improving. And that, to us, translates to value, and we're going to price the value. And so I think the industry will continue, hopefully, to take - to look at that and we - rationalism result to that. So we're going to continue down this path, more of it rather than less of it and expected to be successful. Brett Feldman : A quick follow-up if you don't mind. Obviously, the plans that include a lot of content tend to be the higher prices, and you clearly see that helps ARPU. Are you seeing that they are also helping churn? John Donovan : Yes. If you look at the churn, this year was again 3 bps up over. But I think that compared to the industry, we did really well. Compared to seasonality, we did really well, and the number that we're comparing to last year was our all-time low. So I do think that it's a strategy that's working for consumers and therefore, working for us. And that is the currency that we're after there because you could start to trade some things that customers value higher than the ARPU differential. So we are carefully managing this portfolio, same strategy in wireless and in video. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the questions. John Donovan : Sure. Randall Stephenson : Lori, we\u2019ll go to next question please. Operator : We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Barden : Hi, guys thanks for taking the questions. Thanks for the expenses format on the call, I think it's super helpful. Randall, I guess, my first question would be the telco guy, the media industry is definitely not my wheelhouse yet. But if I'm watching what's happening out there, we've got Fox deciding that they're not big enough to be a competitor in the media industry, so they're selling. And we've got two large competitors in Comcast and Disney who feel, in order to be competitive with the Netflixes and the Googles of the world, they need to get even bigger. And so I guess, my question for you is kind of how do you - how comfortable, do you feel, with the scale that you have now in the content business. And are you on the cusp of having a global strategy that's going to kind of try to compete with those other larger content houses? That will be my first one if I could. And then the second one, John, will be for you. We've been hearing a lot about the directionality of the deal about how we take the information from your side of the business, we bring it over to Brian and let him crunch through it and sell it into Turner. But as you sit there and look at what WarnerMedia could mean to your business, the broadband business, the mobile business, even the business, business, kind of what do you see as the opportunities? And if you could give us some examples, that would be super helpful? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : David, this is Randall. I'll go first, and I'll hand it over to John Donovan. You said John. That's just not just very descriptive. But I'll direct that to John Donovan when I finish. In terms of the - what you're seeing happen in the landscape, the media landscape, it's fascinating to us. We expected some time back this is exactly what you would see happen, that you'd begin to see media companies consolidate and people would see the importance of scale and changing models, changing distribution models and so forth. And so it's hard to imagine. But it was back in 2016 when we actually did this deal, and so it was early in 2016 where we were asking ourselves, if you believe that's going to happen, if you believe that your networks are going to be able to distribute seamlessly premium content, if you believe that your information and your distribution business is really valuable and can drive different advertising models, then you probably ought to move fast and own media. And as we look at a scan of what opportunities are out there, Time Warner jumped out. It's just the obvious choice. It was the one scale player that had a great scaled distribution platform, a great scale in terms of advertising inventory and cable networks. It had the scale position in terms of content creation with Warner Bros. And it was just the obvious partner for us, and everything else was a distant second. And so from the -- to answer your question directly, we feel really good about what we have. And then you add to it the digital properties and CNN being an off-the-charts, great digital property. You put all the CNN digital properties together, they are the most accessed digital news sites in the world. And so putting all this capability, data, ad tech and so forth, together with the media company, we think is a really, really great combination, and we could not be happier that we moved first. I think moving first, you rarely forget -- you rarely regret it when you see an industry trend happen. So we saw this would happen. We went first, and we think we got the best business that was on the -- that was actually in the media space. So we feel really good about it. JD, you want to talk about integration of content? John Donovan : Sure. Thanks. So Dave, we had 600 days to think about this. And when you form your synergies, you deal with some of the straightforward things that John Stankey talked about. But we -- over the last year or so, as we started to put wireless and video together and saw the trend I talked about earlier start to manifest, we are learning as an integrated carrier. So I circle back and say, when we bought DIRECTV, remember, we talked about bundling up and a lot of skepticism about the value of bundling up versus it being just a price discount. And I got to tell you, you start to look at the economics of churn reduction and you start to learn how these currencies pass back and forth, you see the same opportunities here. You see -- because the killer app right now on broadband and on wireless is video. So as you start to look at what customers place value on and you move from buying and reselling or see us being completely out of that market and you go to owner's economics, we really have always had a good sense as to what customers are using and doing on our network. So to be able to value that into pricing and start to trade off these currencies that we learned over the last 3 years of how do you trade off an acquisition dollar for a dollar of content, how do you trade off a customer install cost versus a churn reduction, we've built some solid muscle now to know how those economics move around. So we are really thrilled about what the content business can mean for us in simple ways. Store traffic, our -- one of our wireless strengths is that our close rates in stores are up. We want more traffic in the store. If we have a tent-pole release from the studio and we can find a way to integrate in the stores and drive traffic, we found a synergy. So basic things that video does, like drive traffic and hours of consumption, become assets for us to acquire value in ARPU and retain customers, and we really are getting our strides to figure out how to move those currencies across franchises. So we're really thrilled about what this can do for broadband and for mobility. John Stankey : David, let me suggest -- I would flip your first question around slightly. I don't worry about scale and content. I mentioned at the outset of this discussion, we're going to do 70 TV shows to the industry this year out of Warner Bros. Didn't even talk about what the incremental number of series will be coming out of HBO, which is very unique, high-valued, premium content that's targeted. Our ability as a company to decide to produce content that scales, that matters is probably second to none in the industry, and that's at a rate that I'm not sure others operate at or are just coming close to that. I think the race is on for scaling customer bases, not scale on media content. We're on a good shape on our ability to scale media content. We have -- and we start with 170 million customer relationships in that race to have a scaled customer base to sell to. So I don't worry about that dynamic. Randall Stephenson : And add to Stankey's comments, the 170 million, add to it what John has over at WarnerMedia, when we talk about cnn.com being the most frequented news site in the world, you put cnn.com, the Otter Media, Bleacher Report together, there's another -- I think it was almost 200 million monthly users, unique monthly users on each of those sites. And so this is already a big scale direct-to-consumer business. And so now what can you do with HBO and some of the Warner content in terms of taking it directly to the consumer as well that add owner's economics that John Donovan just spoke of and then the ability to have owner's economics going across these platforms, pretty exciting. David Barden : Thanks for taking the question. Thank you. Operator : And we go to Mike McCormack, Guggenheim Securities. Mike McCormack : Hi, guys. Thanks. John Donovan, just maybe some questions regarding entertainment margin, some puts and takes as we think about second half. Obviously, you've got NFL costs that are going to uptick. But what should we be thinking about as sustainability in that sort of 24% type range? And then secondly, I guess, a question, I guess, just for -- actually, maybe John Donovan and John Stankey. Just thinking about the WatchTV product. I guess, firstly, any sort of early takeaways from that product, how successful it is? And then also, can you use that as a model for more integration with the Time Warner or WarnerMedia assets? And how far can you take that without risking legacy linear distribution revenue? Thanks. John Donovan : Yes. Thanks, Mike, a lot of questions nested in there. I'll try to be brief and have you ask follow-ups if I missed anything. If you start with video margins, you see this at the beginning of the evolution of our products that we're trying to get them, as I mentioned earlier, into affordability slots where you get high engagement and therefore, high value for the money. One of the things that is -- it's not well published as you think about these ad stream count differentials, so you fit in the different viewing patterns. So WatchTV has a single stream product; the DIRECTV NOW having two with a pay up to three, obviously, the linear TV products, the satellite delivered and what we are going to be coming out with here in beta next quarter in the early stages, which is a broadband delivered version of it. Now all of a sudden, you'd have a whole series of price points. And so you saw the beginning of what we're doing to reshape DIRECTV NOW. DIRECTV NOW is a placeholder in the market until the deal was finished. A placeholder in the market, that product tried to do too much and too little. So we tried to stretch it down on price. We tried to stretch it up in value. But over time, we think that there will need to be - hit various price points and get the right package bundled in there so customers find value for it. So you saw the first moves that we added, vertical capabilities on top of it, a third stream. And when we got cloud DVR and enhanced the product, we put the price into the market rate for that price. So we've seen DIRECTV NOW. We just had a very strong quarter of DIRECTV NOW ads. So a highlight for you that when you net all of this drama out for a minute on sub counts, if we start there, we were 25 million subscribers when we bought DIRECTV. We're at 25 million subscribers now. Customers we lost in cord nevers and cord cutters, we replaced with products that fit their affordability range. We watched cannibalization closely. Roughly 15% to 17% on every given - in any given month is the cannibalization rate, but 1/3 of those are listed in our linear TV product. It's very likely to churn because of their engagement and where the costs don't fit. So we are watching that very closely. We're slotting these products into affordability and an engagement range where we get the value of it. And I'll point out to you how we procure content on WatchTV. And there's a variable nature to its cost. It is profitable and reasonably comparable to the traditional margins of the business on a percentage of revenue basis. And so the real question that we're learning as we go, once we get out of linear TV and get into open video, which is software-based TV, how much does the category grow because we're getting cord nevers, cord cutters, but also we're getting redundant accounts where it's becoming a personal video product, where a team with a more personalized approach can build a playlist and stack their favorites in a way that it becomes a one stream product that is a playlist that behaves much like music. So when you start to look at addressable markets, you look at the ARPU available, the margins and then you add the owner's economics, which is Brian Lesser getting higher CPMs and John Stankey having owner's economics on a portion of that video cost, now these margins start to blend up into much higher territory. So we look very closely at the blended margin and the movement between these rungs, all while keeping an eye to make sure our subscriber counts keep us at that 25% to 30% share player in the marketplaces. So that's how we're thinking about the strategies in the margins. And the last thing I'll point out is that on those lower-end products, on a revenue basis, I'll remind you that the acquisition cost is much lower because it's much more heavily a digitally acquired product and also, the stacked costs are lower. The cost to deploy, the cost to maintain is much lower. So over time, as we build those volumes up, those are products that will get scalable margins. I'll stop there and see if I missed anything. John Stephens : This is John Stephens. JD, great job on that. I'll give it to you this way. First of all, Mike, we're not giving out specific guidance on margins on any of the specific businesses as I mentioned before, when I think Simon asked the question with regard to Time Warner's specific EPS impact. What I will tell you is this. JD talked about the fact we'll be able to move DTV Now's deliverables, cloud DVR, streams, pay per view, future data insights and other opportunities, it's going to provide revenue opportunities. Secondly, the fact that we've got the four products that are going to cut down on subscriber acquisition costs moving from a satellite -- the only truck that shows up now is now one of our trucks that hang a dish but maybe the UPS or the FedEx truck delivering that incline in the future. All of those things give us the expectations that we can see the margins continue to improve. As our advertising team continues to learn more and get more effective, those advertising revenues will help out on that entertainment margins. So all of those things are giving us optimism as we go forward. With that being said, we've got -- traditionally have tough compares with the NFL content so forth the rest of the year, so we're not giving specific guidance on margins for the third and fourth quarter. Well aware of the improvement in some of the stabilization of the operating contributions in the Entertainment Group, we're - we noticed that. We're aware of it. The team's working hard to achieve that, but we'll keep this process going to see overall improvement on a year-over-year basis coming in 2019, and that's when we expect to see it. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Lori, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. That's from Mike Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Mike Rollins : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. How do you view your sports rights between SUNDAY TICKET for DTV and the NBA for Turner as sustainable points of differentiation for your media strategy? And how important is it to take those content right and put them into your emerging, evolving direct-to-consumer strategy and platforms? John Stankey : Well, let me all answer on behalf on the Turner side of things in sports and John can certainly address the NFL relationship on DIRECTV. The -- look, I view the right sports rights as being critical to our strategy over time. And I view the right sports rights with leads that want to participate in a manner that is reflective of how platforms are evolving and how technology is evolving and how consumers are changing their consumption patterns as being the right partners to work with. And I feel pretty good about the partners that we have at Turner and their flexibility to sit down and look at new models, new approaches to how they put their content in front of consumers, how they think about the importance of digital and their product and the speed at which they're willing to move around those things. Our advertising business is a healthier business with sports in the mix. I think you saw that in the second quarter numbers. Those were largely powered by the great performance of the NBA and a wonderful product that they have, and they're great partners. And so I think it'll be very important for us to continue to manage that portfolio and have the right mix of sports and general entertainment in our portfolio that's attractive to customers in the linear format, and we'll continue to do that going forward. Now that mix may change a little bit. Over time, different options may show up, but the asset test is going to be, I think, sports that are well received by customers, that are valued properly, that are flexible on how they work with distribution rights and technology and then working today's fast paced and dynamic society in terms of how they are consumed. Randall Stephenson : I don't know -- this is Randall, Mike. I don't know if there's much to add as it relates to NFL. I think John Stankey just characterized what it is that we look for in terms of what's important when we think about sports programming. And it's really critical when you think about our business, where everything is going, where John Stankey is going direct-to-consumer, where John Donovan is building platforms, better streaming platforms, where Brian Lesser's monetization opportunities for advertising are tied to streaming capabilities, those are probably our best opportunities. So finding sports programming that fits within those directions, where we as a company are going, are really, really important. John Donovan : And I would also say, just as we get more targeted, just sort of one way to think about it is a sports lover in the future is not going to be the segmentation. It's going to be a Red Sox fan, a Yankee fan who spends winters in Tampa. So these things had been acquisition tools over time. They're much more retention and engagement tools now that fit in that profile I mentioned earlier. And so we're going to really be trying to innovate on all of these things that are very segment specific, and I think you're going to see us really get creative in what we do going forward. Randall Stephenson : Okay, very good. Listen, that wraps up what we wanted to cover with you this evening. I appreciate everybody joining us. What I would sum it up by saying is we've had a few months of distraction. And make no mistake about it. It's been a bit of a distraction for both businesses, the WarnerMedia as well as the AT&T side. That is behind us, and we are executing. And I feel like we're executing very well on the communications business side, the momentum it's gaining as you're seeing service revenues are up. Subscriber metrics are improving, margins are improving. I feel really good about how that team is executing. The WarnerMedia side, I couldn't be happier with the position that the company is in, the business is in, and it's going quite well. Our LatAm business, Mexico, it's going on all cylinders. It's been aggressive on pricing down there, but we are staying the course. We're competing aggressively. We're gaining a lot of momentum. It has a strong path and a good line of sight to profitability. And stay tuned on advertising. I could not be more excited about the opportunity here for advertising, the ad tech acquisitions we've made. So thanks again for joining us and look forward to seeing and talking to everybody again.",

David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to AT&T's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter Conference Call. As John had mentioned, I'm Mike Viola. I'm Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is, first, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; John Donovan, Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Communications; and John Stankey, the CEO of WarnerMedia. Randall is going to provide some opening comments, turn it over to John Stephens, who is going to cover the consolidated segment results. Also he'll provide an update on our deleveraging plans. J.D. will give a business update for the Communications segment, including comments on FirstNet and 5G. And John Stankey is going to join us for the Q&A part of the call. I'd also like to just update quickly on our upcoming analyst event. We now plan to do a video webcast, a single sell-side, buy-side meeting. It's going to be here in New York in the late afternoon of November 29. And so more details to that will come in the next few days. Finally, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin. It says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risk and uncertainty. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions, 101 and 102, and so we can't address any questions about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that includes our news release, 8-K, investor briefings, and associated schedules. And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I'm going to be very brief before I hand it over to John Stephens. But this year's results, everybody knows, has had a lot of noise in them. We've had a significant amount of M&A. We've had a number of accounting rule changes imposed on us. And the third quarter was obviously particularly impacted by it being the first full quarter with WarnerMedia results in it. And just to cut through the clutter, what I typically would like to do is just go straight to the cash flows. And if you look at the cash flows for the quarter, I feel really good about the results. Our cash flow from operations was $12.3 billion for the quarter. That's up 14% year over year. And when you look at free cash flow, which is the cash available to pay dividends or pay down debt, that was a very healthy $6.5 billion, which is up 17% year over year. And if you get beneath that, there's just a couple of areas that I think are worthy of pointing out. First is Mobility, and Mobility is growing. And that's significant because it's obviously our largest contributor to earnings and cash flow. And what I'd really point out is that growth is being heavily driven by our Prepaid business, which is running red-hot. And I think we're seeing Cricket truly begin to distinguish itself in the marketplace. Then also when you look at WarnerMedia, all three divisions are growing. And WarnerMedia was immediately accretive in its first full quarter to the tune of $0.05 per share. These strong cash flows have put us on track to hit our deleveraging objectives, getting to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA by year-end 2019. And John Stephens is going to go into this in more detail. But what you're going to see is that we're going to exit this year with our debt maturities over four years old that are going to be at a very comfortable level as we exit this year. And then last, we made a number of pricing moves on video. And we're getting near the end of our fiber build project, which is basically laying the foundation for stabilizing our broadband and TV business profits in 2019. So across the business we \u2013 obviously we have a lot of work to do, a lot of integration efforts going on with WarnerMedia. But I like the momentum. I feel confident that we're on track to deliver the plans that we've laid out. And as Mike pointed out, we're going to just go through the quarter today. But when we get together on November 29, we're going to give you a full blown look at our plans as we move into 2019 and beyond. So with that, that's my high-level view on the quarter. And I'm going to turn it over now to John Stephens. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being on the call with us this morning. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide 3. As we've done in previous quarters, we'll be referring to comparable results for most of our segments on the next few slides. AT&T adopted new accounting standards this year that deal with revenue recognition, certain pension costs, and certain cash receipts on installment receivables. These changes impact our income statements and cash flows on a reported basis. So at the same time the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees and other regulatory fees on a net basis. So getting to it. Adjusted EPS was $0.90 per share, which was up more than 20% for the quarter and up 18% year to date. Tax reform continues to have a positive impact on EPS, as does adoption of revenue recognition standards as well as the full quarter impact of WarnerMedia. Earnings were pressured by strong smartphone volumes with the launch of the iPhone XS as well as some foreign exchange pressure, especially in our VRIO and WarnerMedia operations. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth at the upper end of the $3.50 range. The fourth quarter has traditional seasonal Wireless pressure. But our strong third quarter iPhone volumes and WarnerMedia will ease that impact. Consolidated revenues came in at $45.7 billion, up 15%, thanks mostly to the Time Warner acquisition. When you look on a comparative basis and without Time Warner, revenues were essentially flat year over year. Gains in Wireless and Xandr, our new advertising segment, were offset by declines in legacy services, the impact of transition in our video business, and foreign exchange pressure. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over year as reported and on a comparable basis. The addition of WarnerMedia provides margin support, but solid smartphone sales did drive some pressure. The biggest margin pressure continues to be because we're transitioning from linear to over-the-top video. Our cash from operations and free cash flow continue to be strong as Randall pointed out. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion in the quarter and $14.4 billion year to date. This is even more impressive when you consider capital spending of $5.9 billion with no reimbursement of FirstNet costs in the quarter. We continue to expect our capital spending in the $22 billion range this year. But we don't expect as much vendor financing in the fourth quarter as before. So now we expect to be in the $24 billion range in gross capital investment for the year. We're feeling really good about our free cash flow position heading into the fourth quarter. We expect $1.3 billion of FirstNet reimbursements in the fourth quarter, since we've received the FirstNet authority's approval for the latest contract milestone achievement. We also have another full quarter of free cash flow from WarnerMedia. And when you consider last fourth quarter's free cash flow of $4.5 billion, remember it included $1 billion of employee-related payments, including employee tax reform bonuses and some benefit funding plans. When you take this all together, you can see how this gives us growing confidence in our cash position as we move forward. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow is a critical part of our strategy and gives us the financial strength to both invest in the business and improve our leverage position. Let's now talk segment results, starting with our Communications segment, which consists of Mobility, Entertainment Group, and Business Wireline units. That information is on slide 4. The tide definitely turned in Wireless. Postpaid phone growth continues. Prepaid had its second best phone net add quarter in more than 10 years, and service revenues grew by more than 2%. Total Wireless revenues were up more than 5%, thanks in part to higher equipment revenues. Postpaid phone net adds continued its year-over-year improvement, adding 69,000 subscribers. That's the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Prepaid added another 570,000 subscribers with 481,000 of those being prepaid phones. Strong sales did pressure margins, where we sold 700,000 more postpaid iPhones this year than last. But we grew EBITDA, and our service margin was still solid, coming in at about 50%. Moving over to our Entertainment Group, we continue to see the impact of the video transition on our revenues and margins. We told you last quarter that we expect revenue EBITDA pressure to continue the rest of the year. And recently Randall talked about stabilizing the business next year. Revenues did improve sequentially in the quarter, but some of the margin pressure continued. Third quarter EBITDA comparisons were also pressured by an additional week of NFL SUNDAY TICKET games, which we'll get back with one less week in the fourth quarter, and last year's Mayweather/McGregor event, which was a record-setting event. Without those pressures, EBITDA was down about 14% year over year, an improvement from the second quarter decline. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to stabilizing EBITDA in 2019. John Donovan will provide more details on how we'll get to Entertainment Group EBITDA stability next year. But you can see the impact of some of the first steps we are taking in our third quarter results. DIRECTV NOW net adds were 49,000. We've been very successful in building our over-the-top subscriber base. Now we're focusing on improving profitability; scaled back our promotions and special offers. We also moved toward market pricing in the quarter. We expected net adds to be impacted by these actions, and they were. But subscriber growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Traditional TV subs continue to decline but at a slower rate than last year. U-verse improved, but we continue to see declines in DIRECTV subscribers. DTV subscribers were impacted by a 32,000 customer loss due to the elimination of our prepaid video product in Puerto Rico. In Business Wireline, we continue to improve margins through cost efficiencies. Margins were up on a comparable basis, as these cost efficiencies offset legacy revenue declines. Part of the margin improvement and the revenue lift was from the realization of some intangible revenues in the quarter. But even without those revenues, margins were still up year over year. Now let's look at WarnerMedia's third quarter results. Those are on slide 5. WarnerMedia had strong revenue growth with gains in all three business units. Higher subscription revenues at HBO and Turner and increased TV licensing revenues at Warner Bros. helped drive most of those gains. Total WarnerMedia operating expenses were up year over year, primarily due to higher television production costs at Warner Bros., which were partially offset by expense declines at Turner and HBO. In August, during our accounting call we estimated the amortization for Time Warner pre-acquisition, pre-release content was $600 million and would be included in segment EBITDA. Since then, we've done a lot more work, specifically on our purchase-price accounting efforts. And the amount amortized this quarter increased by about $200 million over what we expected to reach nearly $800 million in the quarter. But even with this additional $200 million charge, WarnerMedia EBITDA still grew. Turner saw solid gains in subscription and content level revenues. Subscription revenues continue to grow, thanks to higher domestic rates and growth of Turner's international networks, even with some foreign exchange pressure. Turner's advertising revenues declined 4%, or 3% excluding foreign exchange. Domestic ad revenues declined low single digits due to lower delivery across various Turner networks, primarily for kids and young adults. International ad revenues declined in the low double digits, reflecting pressure from foreign exchange rates. Turner's operating income was up 13% reflecting revenue growth and a decline in operating expenses. HBO also delivered solid subscription revenue growth in the quarter. Subscription revenues were up 7%, primarily due to higher domestic rates and subscriber gains in our national markets. Content and other revenues were down due to lower home entertainment and international licensing revenues. HBO's operating income was up nearly 11% due to higher revenues and a decline in expenses. Warner Bros. revenues grew nearly 8% in the quarter driven by higher television licensing revenues. Television revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing and initial telecast revenues, driven in part by the number of Warner Bros.-produced TV series. The actual revenues were mostly flat, which was quite an accomplishment considering the tough comparison to the year-ago third quarter. Television licensing and films and a strong box office slate with hit releases such as Crazy Rich Asians, The Meg, and The Nun mostly offset the challenging theatrical slate and home entertainment release comps from a year ago. Warner Bros. operating income was essentially stable, as higher revenues were offset by higher costs, primarily due to the higher TV productions. WarnerMedia companies also continue to be recognized for their excellence in producing high-quality entertainment content. HBO, Turner, and Warner Bros. scored another impressive performance at the Emmys with WarnerMedia coming away with 37 primetime Emmy wins. And Turner and HBO added another 12 news and documentary Emmy Awards as well. CNN got six of those. I think that was a record for them. Now let's look at our Latin America and Xandr results on slide 6. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were down year over year, primarily due to foreign exchange. Without the foreign exchange impact, revenues would have grown 5% on a comparable basis. Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 900,000 new subscribers and more than 3.5 million in the past year. We now have more than 17 million subscribers in total. Service revenue in Mexico was down largely due to the decision we made in the first quarter to shut down the wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel as well as some FX pressure. Without those impact, service revenues would have been up year over year. While FX did impact our Latin America satellite operations, the business continues to be profitable and generate cash. During the quarter, we launched Xandr, our new advertising and analytics business. And you can understand our enthusiasm for this business when you look at the results. Revenues were up more than 30% this year, partly due to our acquisition of AppNexus in the quarter. But even when you take AppNexus out, revenues were up 22% with EBITDA growing by more than 15%. We believe we're just scratching the surface here. You can see what a difference targeted advertising makes when you look at the difference in the growth rates between AdWorks and Turner. We're excited about the opportunity to apply our advertising technology to the Turner inventory. All together we have about $7 billion of consolidated annual ad revenues with a portion of that being addressable, highly targeted advertising. AppNexus adds to our analytical capabilities even more and is a critical step in building our digital advertising marketplace. We'll talk more about this during our analyst meeting next month. And now I'd like to turn the call over to John Donovan, who will provide an update on our Communications business. John? John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update \u2013 oh, sorry. Thanks, John. I'd like to spend the next few minutes updating you on our priorities as we close this year and head into 2019. That includes building on our momentum in Wireless, expanding our fiber footprint, managing our video transition, and executing on our FirstNet deployment, and lastly, building on our lead in 5G. Let me begin with our Mobility business. As John told you, the Mobility business delivered strong results in the third quarter. After four years of industry transformation, we've turned a corner with service revenue growth. I'm confident in our momentum as we finish off the year. We continue to focus on quality phone net adds, both prepaid and postpaid, and saw year-over-year success with both in the third quarter. As John mentioned, this is our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds. And we had the second highest prepaid phone net add quarter in more than 10 years. We continue to be impressed with our prepaid customer base. Our prepaid business has very strong margins with a revenue stream that's growing at almost 7% year over year. From a pure value perspective, they look very similar to some of our postpaid base. In fact, through the first three quarters of the year, about 60% of our Cricket net adds have characteristics that would generate similar value that we see out of some of our postpaid customers. Moving to the video business. We continue to navigate industry pressure. We have plans to bring EBITDA stability back to our Entertainment Group. Allow me to elaborate on that. First, we're refining our four video products, tailoring them to customer needs. Our mobility-focused WatchTV is gaining traction. DIRECTV NOW is being updated to increase its simplicity and further differentiate the service. And our premium DIRECTV and U-verse services focus on the traditional linear TV viewers. We've also begun beta testing our proprietary thin client streaming service and plan to roll out trials in the first half of next year. This will be a more measured roll out. And like our introduction of WatchTV, we expect this service to be EBITDA positive. And over time, it should lower our acquisition cost of our premium video service. And both of these use the common platform we introduced with DIRECTV NOW. Second, we made the strategic decision to rationalize our promotions and special offers for DIRECTV NOW. We're taking a more tailored, data driven approach. Specifically, we focused on reducing promotions for low value, high churn customers. Since launching DIRECTV NOW, we've learned a lot from our nearly 2 million subscribers about price elasticity and customer behavior with the virtual MVPD services. For example, we see customer behavior evolving somewhat like Wireless, with some customers seasonally shopping for shows. We know our customer base now. And with our data, we'll continue to tweak our approach to optimize profitability and see our value proposition stabilize. This puts us in a more stable position as we set up a product realignment in 2019. Thirdly, we're evaluating our program lineup. Content is the largest and fastest-growing cost of any video offering. We're evaluating our channel lineups and taking a fresh look at how we can align content cost with the price. It's also about what customers want. And many want smaller, value-based video packages. And fourth, the two-year price lock promotion for DIRECTV and U-verse is being lapped. This gives us additional ARPU growth going forward and significant margin relief through 2019. Another way we're working to improve Entertainment Group EBITDA is by driving broadband growth in our fiber footprint. We now cover more than 10 million customer locations today and plan to add 4 million more locations in the next year. We already have substantially more than 3 million broadband customers in our fiber footprint. And the longer we have fiber in the market, the higher our penetration. In fact, we expect our fiber broadband base to increase by more than 1 million subscribers this year. This shift to fiber is beginning to drive IP broadband ARPU growth. The strategic pivot we're making with video, combined with our execution with fiber gives us the confidence that we will stabilize Entertainment Group EBITDA next year. Finally, we're keeping a laser focus on costs in all of our businesses and maintaining our margins in Business Wireline. Let's now move to an update on our FirstNet deployment, which is on slide 9. Our FirstNet team continues to execute extremely well. So far, we launched a nationwide FirstNet dedicated and physically separate network core with FirstNet traffic moving on it. We have priority and pre-emption in place, allowing continuous service during times of heavy traffic. FirstNet devices are ready and available. These devices support all AT&T commercial LTE bands as well as the FirstNet Band 14 and meet the band priority selection technical requirements. And we're six months ahead of schedule with our network deployment already covering about one-third of the expected FirstNet area. We're seeing in real time how we are performing in times of emergency with Hurricane Michael being the latest example. We began preparing for this storm before it arrived and our work continues even to today. Because of these efforts, we were able to keep our customers, including first responders, connected during and after the storm in many areas. In fact, our network operated at 90%, and usually better, of normal performance in the areas affected by Hurricane Michael. And through our tight coordination with public safety, we rolled out network assets to impacted areas to keep first responders connected. We also worked with local authorities to identify public safety agencies that were without service from their wireless provider and delivered hundreds of FirstNet-enabled devices to help these first responders carry out their important mission of keeping the public safe. One first responder went as far to say, when everything else was down, FirstNet was working. That's high praise, and we're humbled that we can play a part in helping a community recover from such a devastating storm. That's what FirstNet is all about. We continue to push our deployment. We're climbing towers and adding 700 megahertz, AWS, and WCS spectrum all at once. We're also adding new radio capability, which will enable us to upgrade the tower to 5G, without another tower climb. The first responder community is a great sales opportunity for us. It's an area where we've been under-penetrated in the past. But with our dedicated network core and outstanding performance when it matters most to the first responders, we're making headway. We now have more than 250,000 subscribers on FirstNet with more than 3,600 agencies represented. With a sales team dedicated to building this base, we believe there's a lot of opportunity waiting for us. Now I'd like to talk about our leadership in 5G, which is on slide 10. AT&T is on track to be the first wireless carrier to introduce mobile 5G services in the United States in the next few weeks. This will be standards-based 5G. We plan to introduce 5G in parts of 12 cities by the end of the year. And we've announced additional 5G cities for next year, as we drive toward nationwide coverage of our 5G network. Second, our 5G foundation is in place. We've completed 5G trials in several cities in the last three years. Fiber is the backbone of 5G, and we have one of the nation's largest fiber networks. Including businesses, we pass about 18 million customer locations today and are expanding that to more than 22 million locations by next year. We plan for our 5G Evolution to be in more than 400 markets by the end of this year with nationwide coverage by mid-2019. Customers are seeing a dramatic lift in speeds with theoretical peak speeds reaching 400 megabits per second. We also plan to launch LTE Licensed Assisted Access, or LTE-LAA, in parts of 24 cities by the end of the year. These are the building blocks towards the transition to 5G and can deliver speeds substantially faster than traditional LTE. We're also the leader in software defined networking and are on track with our virtualization goals. This virtualization is bringing baseband units to the edge of the cloud or core and is going to be key for ultra-low latency that's in 5G. Thanks in part to our FirstNet build, our fallow spectrum is being put into service at a rapid rate. We're on track to increase the amount of spectrum deployed by nearly 50%. This is having a dramatic positive impact on our network, and others are noticing. We've been named the nation's best network by a September GWS OneScore study, which is the largest and most comprehensive network study of its kind. Our network already is a recognized leader, and we're taking steps to make it even better. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our deleveraging plans. Those are on slide 12. You know the commitments we've made. We plan to get to the 2.9 times range by the end of this year, drop that even lower by the end of next year to the 2.5 times range, and then return to historical levels by year-end 2022. One big way we plan to accomplish that is through free cash flow growth. Our strong third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow results points to our ability to do just that. We also continue to look for ways to monetize our large asset portfolio. We made several such moves in recent years, most recently the sale of our data centers and our under-utilized spectrum, combined generating over a couple billion dollars of proceeds. And we've identified billions of dollars of other assets where we can do more. So this is an ongoing process. Our merger synergies will also help contribute, and they remain on target, $1.5 billion in cost synergies and $1 billion in revenue related synergies on a run rate basis by the end of 2021. In addition, capital market options will be under consideration \u2013 or quite frankly, are under consideration. All options will be evaluated. We're going into diverse markets and looking at diverse investor bases. We'll consider make whole calls, tenders, as well as any other efficient capital alternatives. We've got that work going on now. You can see how we are at managing our debt maturities by looking at what we've accomplished just since the merger closed. Since we've closed the deal, we've managed to spread maturity towers very effectively and expect to retire or refinance $28 billion of near- to intermediate-term maturities by the end of the year. As you can see from our schedule, we've done most of that already. We've done this with cash on hand at the time of the close and utilizing diverse capital markets over the last four months. Our debt towers will look much different, resulting in very manageable annual debt payments. We also have been able to lock in a portion of our debt into historically low interest rates. About 90% of our market debt is fixed rate, protecting us from rising interest rates. And when rates do rise, as they have in recent months, we have a natural hedge with our pension and benefit plans. Simply put, a 1% increase in the discount rate today will decrease our pension plan liabilities by about $5 billion, so a very effective economic hedge. Bottom line, our financial strength allows us to achieve our leverage targets and continue to invest in our business and return value to shareholders. With that, I think we're ready to take your questions. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: John, go ahead. Operator : Thank you. And first, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning. So, Randall, I think recently you talked about the free cash flow as part of the deleveraging, getting to a $25 billion floor, the value exiting 2018. I wonder if you could just elaborate on what's driving that? And how you see that evolving over the course of 2019? Thanks. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Hi, Simon. Thanks. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Morning. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, what I said through I think it was last month was that we had told The Street, we had told everybody we would do $21 billion-plus this year in free cash flow. And that includes $2 billion of merger costs associated with the Time Warner deal. And so the $21 billion, plus the $2 billion, which doesn't recur next year, puts you at $23 billion. And that all \u2013 the $21 billion also only included a couple billion, $2 billion of Time Warner cash flow. So you put Time Warner in for a full year, you get to $25 billion exiting this year as a run rate. Now if you just kind of want to test that number, if you look at the first quarter we just posted here, in terms of what our free cash flow was for this quarter at $6.5 billion, annualize that, and you're at a $26 billion-plus kind of run rate number. And so just to kind of help you simplistically understand how you get to a $25 billion number, that's kind of the path that we're on right now. And that assumes no growth in our Mobility business. It assumes no growth in WarnerMedia. We assume that we keep the Mobility business growing. We assume that we get the Entertainment Group, our broadband and TV business to stable next year, whereas right now it's declining on an EBITDA basis double digits. And then you get Mexico from an EBITDA dilution standpoint this year to we think we can get this thing to break even or positive next year. So you put all that together, we get good EBITDA growth, which should drive cash flow growth. And so $25 billion is just a comfortable number that I put out there. And we're actually on a run rate that looks better than that now. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, Randall, just if I can (36:23) add to that, we're really far along on our 12.5 million [customer locations] fiber-to-the-prem commitment out of the DTV transaction. That'll be done some time around the middle of the year, has to be. So we have a support there for a capital management, capital spend management. Secondly, we've essentially completed the Mexico 100 million LTE build. We're just about right there on the edge. So once again, that'll give us an opportunity to hedge that. Third, the FirstNet team and the network team working with them have been remarkable. They're well ahead of the targeted builds. We spent money to do that, close to a $0.5 billion, a little bit over $0.5 billion this quarter that we weren't reimbursed for. And so that bodes well for us as we have had our milestones approved and expect to receive $1.3 billion in proceeds, reimbursements for that contract this quarter. So all of those things are what are building this momentum about strong cash flows. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I think it's important too to take what John said and I said about where we exit the year in terms of free cash flow. And then pair that with that last schedule John Stephens walked you through on our debt maturities. We will exit this year with average annual debt maturities for the next four years of $12 billion, well within the free cash flow less dividend range. And so we feel like we've got it stacked up where the debt is very manageable. We can get to these deleveraging targets that John spoke of. And I think it's stacked up well right now. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Thank you. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Take the next question. Operator : And we'll go to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Randall, a broader question. You guys have voiced a lot of confidence in the financial performance, which we just heard, and the strategic vision of the company. But the market's clearly not giving you credit for a lot of these things. As you talk to investors, what do you think it is that the market's missing? Is it what you just went over there, the cash flow profile of the company versus the debt? Or if you could just sort of \u2013 what do you think is missing from the equation, given the performance of the stock? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I think in terms of missing from the equation, I feel like we're tracking on plan right now, John. As I pointed out earlier, the debt is very manageable. I'm very comfortable with the debt, the deleveraging, and getting down to 2.5 times by end of year next year. I think the cash flow characteristics of the business today already have us there. And that assumes that we have no further growth in 2019 in terms of our cash and our EBITDA. Cash flow is growing at a 14% year-over-year pace. And so I think what we're going to have to just demonstrate to the market is continued performance in the Mobility side of the business. I think we have very good momentum. As I mentioned on the prepaid side, Cricket is just defining that category and doing incredibly well. And that's an incredibly profitable customer base that we're building there and doing very well. The postpaid is doing well. ARPUs are growing in Mobility. And EBITDA looks really good. And so if we can get this, the Entertainment Group, which is our broadband and our TV business, to stability, and we get Mexico to EBITDA neutral, to even EBITDA growth next year, then you have an equation that looks like really good cash flow growth for the next three, four years. And so I think what we have to do is continue executing and posting quarters. I actually am pleased with this quarter. And we continue to do this, I think the markets will reflect that. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : And is EBITDA growth a part of that story? I mean, just it declined about 2.2% this quarter. Last quarter it was down about 5%, which is a nice trajectory to be on. Do you expect that trajectory to continue? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, look, I mean, the EBITDA is driven by our Mobility business. And so can we get the Mobility business to good solid EBITDA growth? And I'll let John Donovan provide more color on that. But I think we have a high degree of confidence that we can get Mobility to EBITDA growth. And so, yeah, to answer your question, we need to demonstrate sustained EBITDA growth on the company. WarnerMedia, I mean you're seeing EBITDA growth today. Mobility, you're seeing us at EBITDA growth. Can we extend the Mobility EBITDA growth and get Entertainment Group to flat? Then there's your recipe for EBITDA growth. John, would you like to add any color on the Entertainment Group? John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: I'd love to. So if you look at the components of the Entertainment Group, what I think gets lost sometimes is it's a broadband-led world out there right now. If you look at the broadband portfolio, our fiber footprint build has given us a lot of inventory to sell into. If you look at the industry's rate of decline on linear video, you find that we're doing dramatically better than the industry where we have fiber footprint. We're doing dramatically better than the industry in churn and acquisition where we have 25 meg and greater. Where our stress is is in the linear, in areas where we're priced with just the linear video. And we're going to have to take actions to continue to improve how we're doing there. But with the fiber inventory that we've got coming online back half of this year, first part of next year, we have a lot of footprint to sell into. And within the quarter, not only do we have broadband ARPU growth, each month of the quarter got stronger. So we feel very good about where the broadband footprint is, in particular the fiber area. And that will help us with the video business, the linear video business. Probably the most important thing to draw attention to is the transition of the video business within. And if I could take just a minute to talk through what we've done there. We thought it important as a 25% market share player in linear video that we be prepared to own the customers in this transition. And so when we put together an OTT product, DIRECTV NOW, we wanted to catch our customers. And I mentioned to you on prior calls that a large portion of those customers were either coming from cable or were coming from cord-cutter categories. So we now have enough experience there to know that that business is a little bit like the prepaid Wireless business. We have seasonal shoppers who are shopping for shows. It's very promotionally intensive for roughly a third of that base. And we're going to continue to curate that portfolio in a way that allows us to become more profitable. So as you think about the profitability of the video portfolio, the full-service premium product is going to continue to be driven by footprint. We feel very good about how broadband assists us there. We're going to take our learnings in DIRECTV NOW and be more discriminating about the content that's provided and the profitability of that content. And then for mobile-only, we've got WatchTV, which right out of the chute is a profitable product. And so I would say that right now we're very well-positioned as we roll into 2019 to be confident that we're going to get EBITDA stability in the video portfolio alone. That coupled with the strength of broadband will give us a really good EG performance overall as we roll into 2019. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks. Just can we take the next question, please? Operator : We'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Thanks, guys. John Donovan, if I could follow-up on what you just said. Can you dig into more on the trends in linear and DIRECTV NOW this quarter? I think that we and other people were a little surprised by the numbers, given the commentary about resiliency in September in DIRECTV NOW, but you said it was better than expected. Was the sequential slowdown a gross add or mostly a churn challenge? Thanks. John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: Well, if you look within the portfolio of the base that we've got, a lot of you folks have done your analytics, done surveying, and it's shown that DIRECTV NOW product, generally, we have tremendous engagement. But within DIRECTV NOW, it's a tale of two cities. It's folks that are just jumping from promotion to promotion and really spinning in the industry between us, Hulu Live, YouTube TV. And so what we're learning, where and who those customers are, what people are viewing. And so we actually expected a far worse outcome than we had. Its resiliency we \u2013 when we raised pricing and took promotions off \u2013 we were not at all promotional or very, very limited promotions of that product overall. And then we started to shift our mix. So what we're after is customers that are highly engaged, that find the product compelling and use it a lot. That will lend itself towards being able to be supplemented by an ad model over time. And so what we wanted is to secure that base. And that's what we're going to focus on. So going forward, our own team forecasts the growth of the OTT category lower than I think a lot of the analyst community does. Because after a first big slug with the introduction of fulsome packages, we're starting to learn now the customer base that's using this. And so if you look at linear TV, it's really going to be about broadband and how do we use broadband to lead ourselves into premium TV. And then get an OTT package that's well-suited to the people that are going to be the heavily engaged users. That customer base that we burned off, if you will, in the third quarter, and that we may or may not going forward chase in any given quarter, is always available. It's very promotionally-sensitive and price-sensitive, so you can always go get that business when you find the economics to do it so \u2013 or advantageous as a result of, for instance, what you can do on ad-supported models. And so we learned a lot about it. We've streamlined the content packages. We've changed the mix of customers we're taking in with a bias towards getting people that are heavily engaged, that are buying on the higher end of those OTT offers. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Thanks, Phil. Go ahead, Phil. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: I was going to say, can I follow up once more on the question earlier? John, did you just say to expect stability in video EBITDA next year, as well as growth in broadband? So are you guiding us now to growing Entertainment EBITDA? John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: No. What we're saying is we expect to see stability in the Entertainment Group as total, fueled in part by our solid performance in broadband as we get the 14 million fiber-to-the-prem customers available to sell into. So the broadband results, which we are optimistic about, will add to our ability to get to overall stability in the Entertainment Group. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Next question. Operator : We'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Maybe one on advertising. Can you talk a little bit more about Xandr? I think a lot of us have seen cable's JV (48:31) in the past. How are you thinking about this differently? What are you doing differently? And I think you recently signed up Frontier and Altice. What's been the receptiveness with those two in terms of the ad community? And then maybe as the last part of the question, how does this then shape your view on Entertainment EBITDA? Thanks. John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: So this is John. Let me try to take a stab at it and ask Randall to jump in. First of all, when we looked at our opportunities with regard to the data analytics and the information that we had available, as well as the advertising opportunity, the first thing was to go out and get a collection of talent that has been established at Xandr that can really give us different insights, different capabilities, and we've done that. The second piece was then to get the \u2013 and so and those included data analytics capabilities that are specifically talented towards or gifted towards the advertising space. Secondly, you need to get the technology platform and the ability to continue to develop data driven products. AppNexus was key to that, not only with their supply side and demand side platforms, but quite frankly, with their core talent, which is their engineering group. That brings us engineers that have this capability and have dealt with this for a long time, a great experience there. When you combine those assets then with the tremendous data we have from a 25 million customer base in the video space, when you combine that with a significant inventory of advertising slots, whether it's the Turner inventory slots, 14 minutes in an hour of TV, or the 2 minutes from DIRECTV, you have both the data and the inventory capabilities. That's what this is about. We have started that process with AdWorks, specifically from the legacy DIRECTV. And you've seen those results, double digit revenue growth. The quarter was 22% without AppNexus, tremendous performance. And we're proving that it works in that linear TV space. I think we had announcements with regard to a couple of the other, if you will, distributors joining with us with regard to this, both Altice and Frontier. So we're starting to get traction with some of our other participants in the industry that view the team and the resources and the capability as being highly attractive. We'll continue to work on those efforts. But longer term, if you can continue to grow this and use this capability, it can provide so much flexibility on your \u2013 from your customer base on linear TV, on the DIRECTV NOW, and the over-the-top. Quite frankly, then moving it on to Wireless and other areas. The reaction I think from the business community has been positive. The reaction from our advertisers, I think it's been generally positive. I think we need to \u2013 we will continue to focus on proving that we can do what we say we're going to do, which the team is certainly doing. And the opportunities are bright, particularly if we can move towards similar results across our total inventory of ads as well as attract other participants to join with us to increase the overall quality. Randall, anything you'd like to add? Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I think you covered it quite well. We just \u2013 we could \u2013 we have a lot of confidence as we build the mechanical tools and put in place a marketplace where people can design campaigns, measure campaigns, and do it without a lot of human intervention, which is what AppNexus does today in the digital world. As we stand that up, can this 22% growth that we're experiencing on just our DIRECTV inventory \u2013 and keep in mind, that 22% growth we saw on the DIRECTV inventory is on a subscriber base that's declining 3% year over year. And so if the revenues are growing 22% on a declining subscriber base, does that translate into a more fulsome inventory over in Turner? And can you drive growth rates that look that attractive on the Turner side? We actually have a high degree of confidence we can. This will take time to put these tools in place and develop the capability. But we have a high to \u2013 we really have a high degree of confidence here. And we're very enthusiastic about this opportunity. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Amy, I know you asked about the advertiser business. Did you have another question in there? Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: No, I actually wanted to just follow up and see if Xandr at all shapes your view on Entertainment EBITDA group's \u2013 and hitting stability? Thanks. John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah. And I think as John earlier covered, we're focused on improving that EBITDA trends and we're looking towards stability coming in 2019. And that's going to be both from the video strategy that John laid out and marketplace actions as well as continued improvement in broadband from our fiber-based products. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: I think the other thing, John, I would add is that \u2013 we mentioned it in the formal notes, is that two-year price locks that we have in place are rolling off. And the traditional linear video ARPU as a result of that can move to market pricing on most of the base. And us rolling past that is a really important lever for us going forward. John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: Even if the content costs continue to escalate at 10%. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: So next question if we could. Thank you, Amy. Operator : We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one for John Stephens on deleveraging. So, John, could you \u2013 two things I guess, two sub-parts. Could you elaborate more specifically on kind of what assets specifically are of a large enough magnitude to be relevant to the deleveraging conversation? And also does the deleveraging target have an asterisk next to it relevant to spectrum spending? And ignoring the millimeter wave, things like CBRS and C-Band. Or are you guys comfortable with where you are spectrum-wise and you can focus exclusively on the deleveraging? And then just a housekeeping item, kind of following up on Amy's question on advertising. I think advertising is kind of showing up in a lot of different places. It's being double counted in some other places. It's being eliminated in third places. So could you kind of just run through, John Stephens again, kind of where we're seeing advertising show up? And what's being reported where? Thanks so much. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Great. So let me take the last one first. Advertising is showing up at about a $400 million run rate. And just pure advertising in the AdWorks, the advertising segment, and that is from ads that are sold on the legacy TV, linear TV business, or in DIRECTV. So the revenue is showing up in advertising segment as well as about just under $6 a month on the customer base in the Entertainment Group. And then that is eliminated through company eliminations at the corporate segment. Secondly, there's about $40 (56:12) worth of revenue this quarter from AppNexus. That's reported in the advertising business segment and only there. Third, there is about \u2013 we run about $1 billion, or maybe it's a little bit less than that, this quarter in advertising in Turner, in WarnerMedia. That's reported there. That is not reported in the advertising segment because Turner manages that, WarnerMedia manages that internally. And then what we do is we provide a supplement to show you a full picture of the advertising capabilities or revenue streams for the total of AT&T. And that supplemental adds those two numbers together and that's included in our disclosure sheet. So that's just an effort to make sure we give you full transparency with regard to what our total advertising is. So that's how it's recorded. That's how it's reported and it gives you comparable information for DIRECTV compared to other participants in the TV industry, gives you the information appropriate for advertising, gives you the information appropriate for WarnerMedia, and how they compare to others in the media industry. So it's just an effort to make sure we give comparable data that you can utilize as you look at other companies. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: With regard to asterisks, there are no asterisks. The 2.5 [times] range, which means if we come in at 2.51 [times] or 2.52 [times], we're going to say we met our mark. That's what the range is about. It's not \u2013 it's about 2.51 [times], 2.52 [times] and we did our jobs. We're not that \u2013 we don't want to come across as being that precise or that forward knowing that we can predict that. But there's no asterisk with regard to, if you will, any asset purchases. With regard to asset sales, I'd just say it this way. We go through the listing of real estate we have, and I know this sounds a little bit \u2013 if we go, for example, the new opportunities on credit process that came through the Tax Reform Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (58:14). We have real estate all over the country that falls into those. We have a whole different category of real estate sales that may qualify or may be interested on that. If you think about our administrative buildings and, quite frankly, across the total new AT&T, you've got a whole opportunity. So I'm not going to get into any major transactions. Certainly, as you can imagine, that might not do anything to help the valuation process. But we're looking at everything. And needless to say, that total listed \u2013 total dollar amount of assets is material even for us, and we'll continue to work it and focus on it. We got a great plan. We have cash from ops, managing CapEx as we go forward with so many of our projects getting completed. That generates great free cash flow and solid EBITDAs with merger synergies and improvement in our business, that we've got a great way to get there. The asset sales are an additional way to make sure that we meet and exceed these goals. But no list of assets on this call today. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.: Sure. Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.: Okay. We'll take one more question. Operator : And that will be from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for getting me in. I'll ask about Wireless. Can you help us think about the churn step-up in the quarter? Whether it was tied more to pricing actions or any sort of change in the competitive backdrop? And then seasonally, I think there's been another step-up that you've typically seen in the fourth quarter. Do you anticipate another step-up off of the 0.93% that you saw this past quarter? Thanks. John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.: Yeah, if we start with the revenue side of the formula, we feel pretty strongly that with the last four or five quarters of growth \u2013 and that's just not year-over-year improvement. When we go to absolute growth, you start to have that kick into the base of your revenue. We took price action, so we expect the churn to tick up as a result of those price actions. And a lot of that has subsided now because the price actions occurred in late first and through the second quarter. And so we feel very good about where we are right now in both customer acquisitions. And by the way, by the data that we looked at, if you take the third quarter, we believe we were the least promotional of all the carriers out there. And yet provided some good net growth on both the traditional postpaid business at Cricket, which you've heard a lot of excitement about today. So if you look at the total performance on phones, smartphones, we had a really good quarter. And we're starting to get growth out of Cricket. We're getting growth in the core business. And we're the least promotional of all the carriers, both from the standpoint of when you look at our share of voice in advertising and the financial promotions, incentives for customers. So we're executing with things like stores and close rates and traffic-driving and putting \u2013 bundling up. That still continues to be a very effective acquisition tool. So if you look at share of gross adds, and I'm sure you folks on the call here will run that, you start to look at how we've been doing. Our share, flow share in the business has improved dramatically year over year. And that's where the strength is coming from. The last thing I'll say is that the iPhone launch is very different this year than last year. The sequencing of the more expensive device, the timing of availability of those, that difference does net into the results. So net of that, we feel that that business was a strong third quarter. And we're very confident in the momentum of that business going forward. Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.: So with that, again, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And just as a recap, first full quarter with WarnerMedia under our belts. And we have cash flow growing nicely. Operating cash flow 14%, free cash flow 17%. Mobility is back to growth and executing well. We feel really well about \u2013 really good about where it's headed into 2019. WarnerMedia executing very well, and the first full quarter is accretive to earnings by $0.05 a share. And going to exit the year with our debt portfolio at a very reasonable place, deleveraging plans on track, getting to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA by the end of year next year. So bottom line, we feel like we're stacking up well for 2019. And appreciate everybody joining us and look forward to seeing everybody on November 29 in New York. Thanks, again.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d also like to remind your that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter conference call. As Willy said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stephens, AT&T's CFO. Randall is going to provide an overall business update, as well as discuss our 2019 business initiatives. John's going to cover results along with the 2019 outlook and then we'll get to a Question-and-answer session. Before we begin, need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking. They're subject to risk and uncertainty and results may differ materially and I'd tell you that additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions, 101 and 102, so we can't address any questions about that today. So as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website, includes our news release, 8-K, investor briefing, associated schedules, et cetera. And so with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, Mike. I'm going to start on Slide 4 of the deck with a brief overview and then I'm going to give some highlights for the past year. And I would characterize our results as basically doing exactly what we committed during our Analyst Day in November and in fact I would say we're ahead of schedule on each of our key priorities, and as we said our top priority for 2019 is driving down the debt from the Time Warner acquisition, and I couldn't be more pleased that how we close the year. We generated record free cash flow of $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter with the dividend payout as a percent of free cash flow below 50%. Our full year free cash flow was also an all-time record even with near record capital spending. For the full year, our dividend payout as a percent of free cash flow was 60% and that allowed us to increase the dividend in December for the 35th consecutive year. So while I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter, we also feel good about the progress we made during 2018 on all of our strategic imperatives. First, we finally closed Time Warner and we have brought together the leaders in content and distribution and as committed this transaction has been accretive since day one. And as John is going to discuss shortly, WarnerMedia had a terrific fourth quarter. We also launched Xandr, our advertising business and then following our acquisition of AppNexus, Brian Lesser and his team are integrating that platform, they're applying Xandr\u2019s customer insights to Turner's ad inventory and with fourth quarter revenues growing at 26%, our enthusiasm around this opportunity is continuing to build. In terms of our networks, our quality and performance are on a very strong trajectory. GWS named us the best network in the most comprehensive study that's been conducted. We introduced the first standards based mobile 5G network in parts of 12 cities last month and our first net deployments finished the year well ahead of schedule. We also accelerated our fiber deployment and we now reach 11 million customer locations in addition to 8 million business locations. As a result, our broadband business grew by over 6% in the quarter and it's really important to note that this fiber deployment is foundational to our 5G network. And I would highlight a couple of other items on this slide. First, strong wireless performance with growth in both revenue and EBITDA. WarnerMedia\u2019s continued strong growth in revenue and margins. In our Latin American business which grew subscribers in Mexico and in Vrio. And last, our total company pro forma EBITDA grew by 7.2% for the quarter. If you go to the next slide, you're going to see our key priorities for 2019, there is no surprises. It's what we discussed back in November and our top priority is to delever the balance sheet. We have strong operational momentum coming out of 2018 and this is going to allow us to reduce our debt and continue our strong record for paying dividends. And it's important to note that we're doing all of this while investing at industry leading levels in fiber, 5G and FirstNet. We expect to continue growing wireless service revenues. The entertainment group that's obviously our heaviest lift for 2019 that we're on a path to stabilize EBITDA in 2019 and we're actually quite confident that you're going to see significant improvement in the first quarter. The focus at WarnerMedia is delivering the merger synergies and continuing to build on our 2018 momentum and in the back half of the year we plan to launch a premium SVOD service that\u2019s featuring content from all of our WarnerMedia brands, specifically Warner Brothers, HBO and Turner. And then last Xandr and it's quickly scaling its capabilities into the ad inventories of Turner, our mobility business and all of our TV and over the top product. So we're focused - that's what we're focused on 2019. We do feel very good about our ability to deliver in each of these areas. And so with that, I'm now going to turn it over to our CFO, John Stephens and he'll take you through the results. So John. John Stephens : Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being on the call. Let me begin with our financial summary which is on Slide 7. As we've done in previous quarters we'll be referring to comparable results for most of our segments for the next few slides. For 2018 AT&T was required to adopt new accounting standards, that deal with revenue recognition, pension cost and instalment receivables. These changes impact our income statements and cash flows. At the same time the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees and other regulatory fees on that basis. And I'm happy to add this should be the last quarter we'll have to open the call this way, as we've rolled through a full year of these accounting changes. Let me start with earnings, adjusted fourth quarter EPS was $0.86 up more than 10% for the quarter and more than 15% for the year. For the quarter, WarnerMedia\u2019s and Mobility\u2019s strong performance drove these results. The benefits from the adoption of revenue recognition standards was generally offset by a higher effective tax rate and foreign exchange pressures. Consolidated Revenue came in at $48 billion, up 15%, thanks mostly to the acquisition of Time Warner. Gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia were offset by declines in legacy services, the impact of the transition in our video business and foreign exchange pressure from Latin America. On a comparable basis, fourth quarter wireless equipment revenue was down by $500 million year-over-year due to fewer smartphone sales. When you look on a comparative pro forma basis revenues were down year-over-year due entirely to lower wireless equipment revenue and foreign exchange pressure. In fact, without those impacts revenues were positive. Operating income showed solid growth and adjusted consolidated operating margins continued to expand up [450] [ph] basis points with strong growth in Mobility and WarnerMedia margins. For the full year adjusted operating income margins grew by 220 basis points. That growth comes even with margin pressure from the customer transition in our video business. One housekeeping item related to the Mobility preferred equity interest we contributed to our pension plan back in 2013, that preferred return about $140 million in the fourth quarter is now reflected in non-controlling interest on the income statement with an offset in other income. Earnings and margins showed strong growth, but perhaps the best measure of our financial success is our cash flows where we turned in record results. Let's look at that on Slide 8. Both our cash from operations and free cash flow hit record levels for the full year. This is really important. For a company that depends on strong cash flows to meet our business goals we need strong cash like we had this past year to invest in our business, to meet our commitments to delever and to continue our long and proud history of returning value to shareholders. Free cash flow is a record $22.4 billion in 2018, that's up 36% with $7.9 billion of that coming in the fourth quarter. This does include a $1.3 billion receipt from our FirstNet contract and reflects our results in managing vendor payables, accounts receivable and a variety of other working capital efforts. It also includes the impact of a nearly $500 million of voluntary contributions to our benefit plans that we made in the fourth quarter. That dropped our full year dividend payout ratio to 60% in 2018. The strong free cash flow comes with near record capital investment. Year in year out, we're a leader in capital investment in the US. 2018 was no different, as we invested nearly $23 billion if you include the FirstNet capital for which we were reimbursed. Equally important to us is our ability to pay a strong dividend. Investors expect one from us, a strong free cash flows has allowed us to pay a solid dividend since we became a standalone company in 1983 and we have consistently raised that dividend for 35 years. Our ability to generate strong cash flow is also a critical part of our commitment to improve our leverage position. Let me give you an update on that on Slide 9. You know our leverage commitments we made, our goal was to get to the 2.9 range by the end of \u201818. Well we did that by paying down about $9 billion since we closed the Time Warner deal. Our next goal is to drop that even lower to the 2.5 range by the end of this year. Our strong free cash flow in 2018 gives us confidence we'll achieve our 2019 free cash flows and be able to significantly delever. We expect about $12 billion in free cash flow after dividends in \u201819. We've committed to use that to pay down debt. That alone will get us to the 2.6 range by the end of the year. We've also been very thoughtful in deliver it and finding ways to monetize our large asset portfolio. We've made several moves in recent years. Most recently closing the $1.1 billion sale of our data centers and we've identified billions of dollars of other monetizeable assets. We have a large amount of office buildings and raw land that we've identified for potential sale. Our Hulu investment is another opportunity with more than $500 billion in total assets we'll continue to look for ways to monetize our asset portfolio and keep you updated on our progress. Our merger synergies will also contribute. They remain on target, $1.5 billion in cost, and $1 billion in revenue for a $2.5 billion run rate by the end of 2021. And bottom line, our financial strength allows to achieve our leverage targets, continue to invest in our business and continue to return solid dividends to our shareholders. Let's now talk results starting with our communication segment. That information is on Slide 10. Communications segment which consists of our Mobility, entertainment and business wireline units. Together this segment grew EBITDA and expanded EBITDA margins by a 120 basis points, driven by great performance in Mobility. Obviously we were sharply focused on profitability last quarter and our Mobility results point to our success. Service revenues grew by $400 million or nearly 3% in the quarter. EBITDA was up more than 13% or more than $800 million. And we had our highest ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 48.6. That's up 450 basis points over last year and was driven by service revenue growth, disciplined promotions, lower volumes and continued cost improvement. We were strategic with promotions able to turn them on and off quickly to effectively compete. We won't hesitate to be where we see an opportunity, especially for high value customers. But even with a strong performance we had 134,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter with 467,000 branded smartphones added to our base. You also saw our cost discipline in our prepaid business. That includes holding the line against uneconomical equipment promotions by our competitors. Even with our spending discipline, prepaid phones grew in the quarter, thanks to the strength of cricket where we added about 240,000 subscribers which more than offset a loss from AT&T prepaid. Prepaid revenue growth was solid and earlier this month cricket passed the 10 million subscriber mark, doubling our subscriber base since we acquired the company in 2014 and momentum continues to be strong. Please note about 60% of our cricket net ads have characteristics that generate value similar to what we see from many of our postpaid customers. We also made significant strides in our network of evolution in the fourth quarter. Randall told you about our network leadership in 5G introduction. With the additional spectrum we're adding, carrier aggregation and other network improvements, 5G evolution is producing better speeds for our customers today when compared to standard LTE. Our first net deployment is reaching critical mass and providing a tailwind for our results. Now let's look at our Entertainment Group results and the steps we're taking to bring EBITDA stability. Our year-over-year decline slowed by nearly $300 million and EBITDA growth rates showed a sequential improvement even in a seasonally pressured fourth quarter. This was driven primarily by a reduction in customers on a two year promotions in the fourth quarter, as well as improvement in DTV NOW profitability. We expect revenue performance to continue throughout the year helping stabilize EBITDA in 2019. We are confident we will stabilize EBITDA this year and expect to see real improvement in year-over-year EBITDA results starting in the first quarter. A more tailored data driven approach with promotions is making an impact. Six months ago we had half a million customers on highly discounted DIRECTV NOW offers, it generally offers that require the customer pay $10 a month for the service. At the end of the year essentially none of these customers remained on those officers. Eliminating these promotions for low value, high churn customers clearly elevated subscriber losses of the quarter, but it had a positive impact on streaming ARPUs and lowered content costs. In fact DTV NOW ARPU was up about $10 sequentially from the third quarter. Our fiber footprint continues to grow. We now passed more than 1 million customer locations with fiber and are on our way to hit the 40 million locations later this year. This will extend our fiber network to 22 million locations when include business. Subscribers on our fiber network increased by more than 1 million last year, driving the number of total broadband customers in our fiber footprint to substantially more than 3 million, and the longer we have fiber in the market the higher our penetration rates go. This performance is helping drive broadband revenue growth, another key focus in our drive to EBITDA stability, and as always, we're laser focused on costs, all costs including content. That too will play a big role in stabilizing EBITDA. Cost efficiencies of the story of business wireline, strategic business services continue to grow and at the 12 billion plus annualized business that helps offset the continuing legacy revenue declines. Our focus on cost initiatives allows us to deliver margins even with the legacy revenue declines. Now let's look at WarnerMedia\u2019s fourth quarter results. That information is on Slide 11. WarnerMedia revenues grew nearly 6% with double-digit operating income in all three business units. Warner Brothers are in the spotlight this quarter, it had a great cash generation year and saw growth across both its theatrical and television business. We had a great theatrical fourth quarter on the back of a strong slate of movies, including Aquaman or Star is Born, Fantastic Beasts : The Crimes of Grindelwald, and The Mule. Aquaman past the 1 billion mark in global box office receipts to date and the critically acclaimed film a Star is Born has racked up eight Oscar nominations. This helped propel Warner Brothers to its best quarterly and full year operating income ever. Turner saw solid gains in subscription revenues. Subscription revenues continue to grow thanks to higher domestic affiliate rates, that\u2019s even with foreign exchange pressure at Turner's International Networks. Total Turner advertising rates continue to be solid even while ratings decline. Domestic ad revenues declined 6% due to lowered delivery across various Turner networks, primarily for kids and young adult. International ad revenues were essentially flat when adjusting for the foreign exchange pressure. However Turner's operating income was up nearly 21%, reflecting solid expense control from solid management of programming and marketing expenses in the quarter. HBO results were impacted by a carriage dispute, but still saw a double-digit operating income in the quarter. Subscription revenues down 3%, primarily due to dispute, without that dispute subscription revenues would have been up slightly. Content and other revenues rose 17% due to higher internationalizing revenues. HBO\u2019s operating income was up 29% due to a sharp focus on expense control and lower programming and distribution costs. Even with the ongoing carriage dispute, we expect HBO to grow revenues in 2019. As a final note, WarnerMedia companies continue to be recognized for their excellence in producing high quality entertainment. WarnerMedia received 11 Academy Award nominations, including A for a Star is Born. This comes on top of four Golden Globe Awards earlier this month. Now let's look at Xandr and Latin America results are on slide 12. Xandr, our new advertising and analytics business continues to execute at a high level. Total revenues were up 49% or 26% excluding AppNexus. Much of that growth can be attributed to a strong political ad season. But even without that revenues continue to grow significantly. EBITDA grew 17% and EBITDA margins continue to be very strong. The integration of AppNexus is on track. AppNexus heads best-in-class technology and data capabilities that strengthen our premium advertising marketplace. We're moving quickly to integrate the Xandr marketplace across AT&T. Much of AT&T\u2019s programmatic spending is moving to the Xandr platform, driving efficiencies on how we activate campaigns. At the same time, our digital inventories enabled on our platform and with our data driving better yield and higher demand. We started making digital data available for Turner's ad inventory and we're optimistic about this opportunity. Xandr\u2019s advanced advertising marketplace is built to power the industry with rich data, technology and talent. Our success across AT&T gives distributors, publishers and buyers confidence to work with us. Already Altice and Frontier onboard and working - and we're working to add more. We power 2 billion of advertising spend through our digital platform, most of which is from third parties. Moving to the international side of the business. Our Latin America operations had a strong subscriber growth quarter, but we continue to deal with foreign exchange pressures. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were down year-over-year, primarily due to foreign exchange. Without that foreign exchange impact and excluding Venezuela revenues would have grown 2% on a comparable basis. In Mexico we had a million new subscribers and more than 3.2 million for the full year. We now have more than 18 million customers in total. Service revenues in Mexico were down largely due to the decision we made to shut down a wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel, as well as some FX pressure. Without those impacts service revenues were up year-over- year. EBITDA was impacted by operation - higher operational expense including a significant amount of non-recurring items. In Pay TV, fourth quarter subscriber net ads were 198,000 with gains largely in the South Region. Total subscribers at the end of the quarter were 13.8 million. While FX did impact our Latin America satellite operations, the business continued to be profitable and generate cash. Now let's look at our 2019 guidance on Slide 13. Our guidance remains unchanged from what we said in our November analyst meeting. Free cash flow will be our most important financial metric. We expect free cash flow to $26 billion range in 2019 and we'll keep our dividend payout ratio solid in high 50% range. As we discussed earlier, we are tightly focused on achieving 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA range by the end of the year. We will also continue to expect to invest at high levels in our business with growth capital investment in the $23 million dollar range. That's before reducing that investment by the $1 billion of FirstNet spending, which we expect to be reimbursed for. While we expect the year-over-year impact of the new revenue recognition standard to be a headwind to earnings, we still expect adjusted EPS growth in the low single digits for 2019. We expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to be approximately 23% excluding any one-time item. That's our presentation. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike for a question-and-answer session. Michael Viola : Okay. We're ready for the questions and so Lea, if you can open up the lines and get started. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. Can we talk a little bit about sub trends both in the entertainment space and the wireless space. Maybe just to feed off your comments on entertainment, it sounds like with the majority of those customers coming off promotions and now losses should - should really start to slow. But at the same time you've got some price ups on the satellite side. So is it fair to say that that those losses could increase in some color there. Also on the broadband side with the fiber buildout, what do you expect in terms of trends there as we look out into \u201919? And then maybe on wireless, just wondering if in your view, you saw some nice postpaid handset growth despite the fact you've pulled back on advertising and promotions. And do you think that you can maintain this level of growth with this low level of spending. And are you starting to see any growth from the first responder community? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : So, John, this is Randall, I'll start and John Stephens can interrupt or append as we go through this. But look we told everybody back in November that we were going to be laser focused on driving down debt and driving cash flow and we pulled all the levers you would expect. And if you start with the TV business, we had come over the last couple of years getting the DIRECTV NOW the streaming product into the marketplace and we had multiple offers out in the marketplace. And you know, it's been a year, year and a half of learning what the market demand was going to be and what the market engaged, and the customer engagement with the product was going to be. And as we matured the product and as we came out of mid-year you know, we just looked at the customer segment. There was a customer segment at the low end, very promotional pricing who are not engaging on the product. We didn't - we don't yet have the Xandr platform stood up to really monetize meaningfully on the digital side, the streaming side and advertising revenue. And we said until we get all those pieces in place let's pull that promotional aspect out. And so we told you in November there were 500,000 of those customers on the promotional pricing. And we started allowing those customers to a trade out that obviously has a significant impact on dilution. You know, the product has been dilutive in 2018. This is one of the main drivers of the dilution and this is also one of the primary triggers as we move into 2019 to getting us to EBITDA stability, as we begin to get the promotional subscribers out and now we have a customer base that's left on the streaming that's growing, remaining customer base is growing and is a highly engaged customer base and has good churn characteristics. And so we actually like where we are in terms of how we're positioning the streaming product. And as I said, it's a major driver to how we get to EBITDA stability next year. On the traditional linear side, these trends are in line with what you should expect as we go forward. We're not going to be horridly promotional to try to drive growth in this except where we have a good strong broadband footprint, particularly a fiber footprint and where we bundle this product with fiber we have really good characteristics, we have good churn characteristics. The lifetime value of that customer segment is really, really high. We tend to over index on wireless penetration where we have the TV product with our fiber and our broadband product. So you know we're going to continue down the path that you saw in the fourth quarter. Now the fiber product, we will finish the lion\u2019s share of the build by mid-year. We'll be at 14 million locations passed with our fiber footprint. You're seeing now the impact as we move our customers into the fiber footprint. You're not seeing the overall broadband subscribers grow, but as people migrate to fiber you're seeing a significant lift in ARPU. And literally we had 6% broadband growth in the fourth quarter with no overall subscriber growth. We added what John 250,000 fiber customers roughly? John Stephens : Yes. Randall Stephenson : In the quarter, we think those trends can continue. In fact, we think those trends are very achievable. And so this is one of those areas as we deploy fiber. We've been doing this long enough now. The penetrations that you achieve are - there a little bit mechanical, you know very, very much what to expect, what penetration rates to expect, what periods of time and what ARPU lifts to get. So this is another one of the key elements on how you get the Entertainment Group to stable EBITDA, you continue growing this fiber revenue stream and moving ARPUs up as people move to fiber. And then on the wireless side, yeah, we feel that we can sustain wireless where we are without having to step up significantly on promotional costs or advertising. But this is the approach we've taken to wireless, particularly in the situation we are or moving aggressively to drive cash flow and pay down debt is we will surge promotions as necessary in the marketplace and that's what we did in the fourth quarter and then we will make sure we keep our high quality customer base in check and we will do what we need to, to keep the customer base in check. But I like how the team is executing here. They've really rationalized their targeted marketing. They're doing a really good job in terms of focusing on the customer bases we want to retain. I love what happens - what's happening in the prepaid based on cricket. Cricket continues to have really strong momentum. We did I think 240,000 cricket subscriber adds in the quarter. What we saw offsetting that is our AT&T branded prepaid which we sell in our AT&T stores, we saw some loss there and it appears that we may be losing some of that prepaid customer base to other companies postpaid customers. And so we're seeing a little bit of migration, so we'll play with that and ensure that up. But that's one of those where the market got incredibly promotional on the prepaid side during 4Q. And we remain disciplined in terms of the amount of promotion we put into handset costs, gave our customers a good value proposition and cricket volumes I think showed it. Do you had anything\u2026 John Stephens : So DTV, I think one thing to point out, I mean, we had the two year price lock, we came off that starting in April. We migrated a bunch of that - a bunch those customers up to market based pricing which has caused some churn and that's what you're seeing in the quarter. We got about 2 million of those customers left. It's really important that we get those up to market pricing. But as we do that, that'll cause some churn, some pressure on net additions. So that's why we're expecting what we're expecting with regard to getting through that. But once again that's a key piece to the profitability. Specifically on the on the AT&T prepaid that we announced, well let me just give you one example, we have a phone that was being offered by our competitors for a $100 that we know the cost was 250, so 150 subsidy just on the equipment for a prepaid customer, we decided not to do that. We knew it. We were aware of it. That caused the pressure and that was one of the reasons but a good example [indiscernible] some of the pressure in the AT&T prepaid. By the same token, our cricket brand continues to do really well both on churn you know, and we're growing revenues in the prepaid space in total, so we feel really good about that. And your FirstNet question, the build-out\u2019s going great, we're at 40% at the end of last year, at the end of \u201918, well ahead of schedule. We're seeing great quality for all our customers, as well as our new first responder customers. We're seeing the effects of 5G evolution be real and in customers hands today which is making a difference. We do have about 450,000 FirstNet qualified customers from about 5000 organizations or departments that have signed up for it. A significant amount of those early adopters were migrations, so maybe close to two thirds or 60% or so, but we are now getting a lot of new ads. And as this build out gets passed the existing 40% in the 50%, 60% and 70% so to speak as we continue make that progress, I think you'll see us begin to grow that new customer share and numbers significantly. So we really do view that as a tailwind for the whole business as it improves existing customers quality, speed, throughput, but it also gives us visibility which we've been successful at, our teams had a good job with gaining new customers. Randall Stephenson : We did an interesting experiment or demonstration is probably the right word on New Year's Eve at Times Square with our FirstNet network. We invited the first responder community to come to Times Square middle of the night when the crowds were massive at Times Square and used the First responder network and see what kind of speeds they would get on a fully loaded network. And I will tell you the first responder community that saw it was quite impressed and we have some high expectations on where FirstNet goes this year and next year. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks, guys. Randall Stephenson : We will take the next question, thanks. Operator : That's the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : All right. Thanks very much. Good morning. Just continuing on FirstNet, where does the build go throughout \u201819 and \u201920, when do you think you're pretty much done with that and related to that build out I think you said at CES that you plan to have standards-based nationwide mobile 5G in 2020. Can you just talk a little bit more about those plans and that put you in a pretty strong position then, how should we expect your ability to monetize that? Thank you. John Stephens : Okay. So we have standards-based mobile 5G today with regard to 12 markets at the end of the year and I think by the end of the first quarter or early here the year will start to get better [ph] I think \u201819 is what we've announced, Mike, make sure I'm correct on that. So we're working that, we're that first with that mobile-standards 5G. If you will it works hand in glove with the FirstNet build. So as we said before as we go to a site now and put the antenna up, put the radios up, retune it for the 700 we're also doing the physical work necessary to make it ready for 5G and from a software upgrade perspective. And so you're connecting the FirstNet with the 5G and stay on the 5G Evolution is really spot on, Simon. As I said we're at 40% at the end of the year. I would suggest you we\u2019ll continue at a comparable pace that we were last year. For most of this year, I won't suggest you, I won't give you a specific number. I will tell you there will be some - they did a phenomenal job at over performing last year. So I'm not going to hold them up to those standards, but we are clearly on track to get this thing done well before the five year and to get the fast - you know, get the majority of the country covered by 2020 when that mobile standards based mobile 5G network is available. With regard to that too, we're selling that service providing that service today with regard to a hotspot or a PoC. We expect the phone to be available - couple of phones available this year. And one of those phones to be worked both backwards and forwards with regard to the standard LTE existing low band, low band, as well as the millimeter wave. So yes, we do believe that provides us a significant advantage. The importance for me though is, is that as this FirstNet build goes, this spectrum goes up as carrier aggregation to 256 QAM and all the other technological improvements go into place our existing customer base is going to get a better sense all that in their service, we think that'll be great for attracting customers, allowing us to compete on a rational basis, as well as key to retaining customers. So I hope I answered your question there, but it is a evolution, it is real, it affects our customers as we roll it out just about our service and it does give us that lead for 2020 as phones come out to make this widely available in the coming year. Simon Flannery : So are you dedicating a portion of your WCS or AWS to the standards-based 5G. How that's - how is that going to work? John Stephens : I'll let the technology guys get that in depth, but I wouldn't say that we're going to dedicate it. I'd say that we're going to make it available, but I will leave my network technology guys to make sure I don't mislead in that answer. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks, John. John Stephens : Thank you, Simon. Michael Viola : We take the next question please? Operator : And that's the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. You know, you noted earlier the success that you have when you're able to sell a video product and a broadband product in the same footprint. You're doing a great job with fiber but even when you're done with the fiber bill that's only going to be a little over 10% of homes in the country that you can serve with fiber. But you are building a nationwide 5G network and we've seen at least one of your competitors already leverage their early phase of 5G to launch a residential 5G product. I was hoping you could give us some updated thoughts around whether you think that's a large addressable opportunity for AT&T to be a residential fixed wireless 5G provider. And do you think you have the resources you need to do that or would you have to acquire more spectrum or more fiber or something along those lines? Thank you. Randall Stephenson : Yeah. Hi, Brett. This Randall. I will say over time three to five year time horizon unequivocally 5G will serve as a broadband, a fixed broadband replacement product. I am very convicted that that will be the case. We are obviously on a standards-based path. We want a standards-based path that is mobile first, but just like every other product evolution and mobility this will play out the same. You know, we back in the 90s everybody was saying wireless would never serve as a substitute for fixed line voice because there wasn't sufficient capacity. Well it is a substitute for boys. We said the same thing on broadband in terms of - with the wireless device serve as a broadband replacement broadly in the iPhone and LTE really began to make that a reality and then as we look at 5G will you have enough capacity to have a good broadband product that serves as a streaming service for all of your DIRECTV NOW, your Netflix, et cetera? I absolutely am convinced that we will have that capacity, particularly as we turn up millimeter wave spectrum. That's where the capacity and the performance comes from and that's where you'll begin to see a broad - a true replacement opportunity for fixed line broadband. So I have little doubt that in the three to five year time horizon you'll start to see substitution of wireless for fixed line broadband. John Stephens : Brett, the only thing I\u2019ll ad is you know, right now we have as we mentioned 10 million Cricket customers, the total cost of 15 million prepaid customers. And quite frankly I think many of them may be using their phone and our broadband connections or mobile broadband connections for their service today. So I say that is that - no that's not exactly on point with your question, but it's a reality today. It's a matter of how this migrates and it goes back to why all the spectrum we're putting up is increasing our spectral capacity by 50% to FirstNet efforts by building it with an expectation to software load 5G on it. All of that is so important because we'll be the ones best positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they play out, which we think will be you know over the next few years, as Randall said, three to five year timeframe. Randall Stephenson : Ironically one of the top use cases, early use cases for 5G are businesses wanting to deploy 5G as effectively their land environment. And so think about a wireless plug and play environment. So that is truly a wireless replacing fixed line as a - is a high speed internet solution. So yeah, this will play itself out that way Brett. Brett Feldman : Thanks. Michael Viola : Thanks, Brett. Lea, next question please? Operator : That's the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. First following up on video, Randall can you confirm that the regular price DIRECTV NOW base is growing? And are those positive EBITDA at this point? And then second, as you think about advertising this year, can you help us think about how you expect that, should we \u2013 given your advertising x efforts, can we expect this to grow substantially faster than the industry overall? Randall Stephenson : Yeah. So on the DIRECTV NOW video, if you pulled a promotional customers or customer losses out the other customer base grew and\u2026 John Stephens : And Phil, the simplest way to think about that is you take 500,000 out of our numbers and you know which is they're all gone or they stepped up to the full service, full price plan. So yes, you know our full price customers grew. Randall Stephenson : And the ARPU, you heard John say, ARPU in the quarter sequentially is up $10, over $10 per line. And so I don't know that I can represent we're EBITDA positive yet\u2026 John Stephens : But we haven't disclosed any of that information, but those - but we are up $11 sequentially, $10 year-over-year, but we're up sequentially in ARPU. Randall Stephenson : And on advertising, Xandr, do I expect we will outperform the market? Absolutely. I would be sorely disappointed if we did not outperform the market. If you look at fourth quarter a streaming TV advertising business grew 26%. I mean, it is radically outperforming the market now. And so I have little concern that we won't be able to outgrow the market. That's one of Brian Lesser's key objectives is to make sure that we're building an advertising business for video that will grow faster than the market. And we're gaining more and more conviction around this the further we get into it. John Stephens : I\u2019d say those are really important, but the ability to take the advertising data from Xandr and the information that data insights and provide it to Turner and allow that to be used as a kind of a merger, kind of a synergistic way to improve that advertising over there to give the turn a team that opportunity to have that information to better sell theirs is just as exciting for me as the advertising insights are for DTV NOW. Philip Cusick : We've talked in the past about the advertising inflection point really not coming until 2020 when all the pieces were in place. Randall do you think that that's happening more quickly or is this still a year of development? Randall Stephenson : It's a year of development Phil, you'll see a strong friend on Xandr advertising. We\u2019ll continue to grow well beyond industry levels, but when we get to the \u2013 the really big opportunity which is what John Stephens has articulated here and that is beginning to leverage our customer insights into the Turner ad inventory, that's going to be more 2020 where you start to see those results really play out. And also as more and more people want to participate in the marketplace, the more success we have, the more we're seeing people come to us and want to bring their inventory to bear in the marketplace and use the customer insights as well. John Stephens : And so the 2020 year for me too is a very optimistic year because there will be another political year and those political years are good for our advertising business too. So just to stay that, so yeah, getting all this done and getting it all ready for that timeframe and having it up and running could be very beneficial for us. Philip Cusick : Got it. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, Phil. Ready for the next question, Lea. Operator : That's the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, appreciate it. I think I want to ask the analog to John's question on subs which is on ARPU, could we kind of talk a little bit about on the wireless ARPU what were the drivers of the sequential step down. I think we heard from Verizon that storm credits were an issue, also potentially FirstNet migrations might have been a contributor. I just wanted to kind of see where we think that's going to go in \u201819. And then second on the linear video ARPU, up $7 sequentially, that's typical to see it up with the SUNDAY TICKET. But we know that there's a promotional price component to that. So if you could kind of disaggregate those two forces so we can kind of guesstimate where we could see the ARPU kind of land in 2019? And then the last one if I could, on the broadband ARPU, it's up 6% year-over-year, but sequentially not growing. And I was trying to understand kind of which of those is the more informative, the sequential trend or the year-over-year trend in growth? Thank you so much. John Stephens : So let me let me let me start with the DTV. You're right one, there is an impact on the SUNDAY TICKET. Two, there is an impact from discounts, but three, there's an impact from the fact that we've been doing this to your pricing initiative since the second quarter, late second quarter such that that is going into effect. So all three of those things are going in, as well as when you become less promotional, generally speaking the promotions are revenue based. So David, what I am really saying is we have four different moving parts, but in essence we feel very good about where that process is going. It is causing some challenges on customer accounts on both DIRECTV and DIRECTV Now, but we're comfortable with where that's going and it's necessary part of that EBITDA stabilization process. With regard to mobility on the postpaid ARPU side, I would suggest to you that the changes are - if you will from a prior year basis are pretty significant, very good. I feel good about that. And we've seen what the market reaction it seems to be accepting that, that has to do with buying up into bigger plans and the premium to get AT&T Watch, but also some of our cost structures past this have gone on. With regard to the sequential piece of that, there is some impacts from prior years and credit and so forth. I view those is not significant change, I think on a year-over-year basis our postpaid ARPU is up probably a buck and a half. And I think there's about a $0.10 difference sequentially. So I feel good about where we're going as we continue to add customers. So I'm not as concerned - I don't think of that as an inflection point at all, I think of it as a continued very good performance on a year-over-year basis and a good stepping off point. I'm not sure if I if I've missed anything. Okay, we'll see on the broadband base, we'll continue. The key is to first get them on the fiber products because there's lower churn, higher retention. Secondly, you get them higher-speed, so they buy up. When you get to 6% year-over-year increase and you get to the point where you start to lap that, which we will do in the second half of next \u2013 of 2019, I wouldn't expect to have those same times of ARPU growth. It just doesn't work that way, but we are seeing improvement in that and you see it in the total revenue piece which is where we're really focused on. We had mentioned earlier, we're continuing to see, you know, after 18 months we're getting over a third close to 40% penetration in those build base and after three years we're getting over 50% penetration in that fiber build space. So we've got a lot of opportunity left. I think we mentioned we only have a - we have over 3 million customers, but we've built into a 11 million. So there's a lot of growth left, not only converting, but also growing total customer. So feel good about all those. I'm hopefully I'm answering your question as directly as\u2026 Randall Stephenson : The other element that kind of factors into John's commentary on broadband, we expect good growth on broadband next year. But part of it is the legacy low speed broadband base is pretty much traded down to very low number, so a lot of that attrition ought to fall off next year as well. So we think broadband setup for another pretty good year next year. David Barden : Great. Thank you, guys. Michael Viola : Thanks, David. Our next question please? Operator : The line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks. Two if I could. First, when you target bending the cost curve for video content in the DIRECTV business is the growth to just slow the growth of programming costs or are you targeting actual drop in total programming costs over the next few years and maybe within that context how do you look at exclusive agreements like the one that you have with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET? And then just backing up to a higher level, when you look at that target of $26 billion of free cash flow for 2019 as you've exited, 2018 are there any changes in the contributors with respect to operations, financing costs, taxes or even what you may contribute to benefit plans? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : So I'll start with the content cost piece Michael, and then I\u2019ll let John talk to you about the cash flow composition and decompose that for you little bit. But the answer to your question on the content cost curve is the objective as content deals come up is to move the needle and it's not on size fits all. There are some pieces of content that we look at the value of the content to the customer versus the price we pay and we say that content has to come down in terms of cost. There's some you know where the customer engagement is high and so you know it might be hard to take the content cost down, but the objective is to keep the equation in balance. And you cannot have a business model where subscribers are declining and you continue to increase costs by 7% and 8%. And so far the content deals that we've been through, we've had some very good success to getting rationalization for those content costs. And so this is a not inconsequential part of the equation to getting to EBITDA stable as well in 2019. And so far early indications are we think this is an equation we can balance and it should be a healthy contributor to it. What we have to do is the customer is just not willing to pay more for the content as the content costs have been increasing over the last few years. And so we got to get the content cost growth in line with what the customer is willing to pay and the customer is willing to pay virtually no additional money right now. So the content costs have to reflect that. So we'll be very assertive as we go through the course of this year and try to control the spend on content cost. And then there's another element to it. And John Donovan and his team are being very smart about this and particularly on the over the top pieces. But what content has to be included in packages, you know, you can control your margins and your content costs by getting the packages more right size to the customers. And so can you bring content costs down to keep margins in check by rightsizing the packages for the customer. So there's a lot of really smart analytical work being done there to how can we help our customers by getting the packages right sized as well. John, you won't talk about cash flow. John Stephens : So thinking about cash flow, Mike, let me try it this way. If you start off with 2018 as kind of a base, a couple of things, one, we won't have the merger deal related costs. Those will go away because we\u2019ve got the deal done. Secondly, we'll have a full year of Time Warner, so add that back in. And Time Warner for six months this year was about $2 billion of free cash flow and the deal cost in total and all the interest everything else was about $2 billion for the first half of the year. Secondly, you'll have - or next, you'll have - we'll begin to see some merger integration synergy benefits. We'll have some costs to putting those into place. So I don't want to overplay that, but it will be the path generator. That's kind of the midpoint from the deal. On interest expense and total of course, we'll see some interest expense from the field costs for the full year. I take that into account when I talk about WarnerMedia generation. What you'll see though from us is a pay down of debt, reducing interest expense, offset by some of the spectrum that we've been capitalizing interest on is now being put into service very quickly by our FirstNet network team. And so as we put that in the service we'll have more that go to expense, so those two will act to offset each other in some way. We expect to have some higher cash taxes this year. As you know this past year because of tax reform and the impacts that were retroactive, we had very low if any tax payments this year, and so we'll see that go up. And then quite frankly as we were this year and as we were last year, the benefit plan funding is - we've got no requirements for any benefit plan funding, pension or otherwise, we're very healthy in those, I think you can see that on our balance sheet. But we'll be strategic, we'll be targeted like we were at the end of this year to take advantage of our strong cash position and to provide some messaging not only to our employees about how important it is and how we're going to stand by it, but also efficiency from a tax perspective and getting some tax actions and so forth. So hopefully I answered your question. I think you're probably focused on interest expense that\u2019s got two items, less capitalized interest on spectrum, so a higher interest expense from that, lower interest expense as we pay down debt. Taxes will be up from a low level this year. Full year Time Warner, no deal cost expected or something - nothing of significance and then merger integration benefits offsetting are hoping to offset merger integration project costs. I hope I\u2019ve been as clear as I can, I think it gives you a way to build to - that makes it easy to see the $26 billion is within our achievability range. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Michael Viola : Thanks, Mike. Next question Lea? Operator : Is the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong : Thanks and good morning. I just want on Warner. It seems like a lot of us look at the streaming landscape and it looks like it's getting a lot more competitive. You have NBC launching in 2020. How are you positioning Warner and the streaming services. And is the focus going to be on sub growth or ad advertising? I guess hand-in-hand with this question, how are you thinking about your content allocation decisions. How do you balance licensing revenue to someone like Netflix versus holding it back for your own use? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Hi, Amy. This is Randall. We have really high expectations for our streaming service. We don't think there is going to be a proliferation of these that will succeed over time, but those who have very, very strong IP, deep libraries of IP are the ones that we think are going to succeed over time. And so that's what we are focused on. We are strong believers and what John Stankey likes to call two sided business models, subscription commercial free elements, you know, like HBO and like Netflix. You know, there's a demand and the customers have become accustomed to advertising free subscription services. And we think HBO and a lot of the Warner Brothers content that's really premium content will fit into that mold. But there are other elements where advertising supported models they are going to be important to keep prices down, to keep costs for the consumer down and actually fund additional content acquisition and purchasing. Xandr is a big part of making that model work. So our model will be a two sided model, with a heavy subscription service, with some ad supported elements to it as well. In terms of the decision making on what to do with premium content is, as content deals come up, there's not going to be a cookie cutter approach to this Amy. I don't think all content is equal in that decision making process. You saw the some of the elements of Friends when the Friends rights came up from Netflix late last year, there was a situation where you ask yourself a question, how important is it to have that content on an exclusive basis versus allowing others to license and using it? And the decision on that is one that Kevin Tsujihara and John Stankey do a lot of analytics and thinking about. But that was one we said exclusivity is probably not that critical on that type of content, but it's critical to have on our platform. So we did license it to Netflix as you saw, but on a non-exclusive basis. And so each of these decisions on significant content like that are going to be evaluated in terms of how critical is it to our platform to have it as exclusive versus you know the economics of licensing it to others. So more to come, but we actually do believe that having a 100 or call it a 90 year inventory of incredible IP is a really important thing and when you look out at the landscape in terms of what is being consumed on a lot of the other aggregators on streaming products, you would be surprised how much of that is Warner Brothers intellectual property. And so we're going to be making some decisions over the coming two, three years on which of that property be brought in and which to be sold on a not-exclusive basis. Amy Yong : Okay\u2026 Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks for your question Amy. We will take one last question. Operator : Very good. It\u2019s a line of Walter Piecyk from BTIG. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk : Great. Thank you. You guys are putting in a lot of spectrum in the network which obviously is an improved performance. Last couple quarters your churn is been up a little bit, Verizon, obviously had decent gross ads. When do you think the impact of that additional spectrum will show up in some subscriber growth either in terms of gross adds or maybe lower churn? Randall Stephenson : I think Walter you're going to see that as we get into second and third quarter this year, as the broad base of our customers begin to experience and realize the effects of the spectrum being put in. And it's really going to be scaling as we get into second and third quarter of this year and it is going to be a discernible difference from a customer experience standpoint as we turn it up and it's going to be a discernible difference for the customer without the customer having to change handsets. The lion share of our customers will just experienced this as we turn it up. And so as John Randall Stephenson just pointed out, we're deploying FirstNet across the country, as we deploy FirstNet we turn all this spectrum up so that FirstNet becomes a driver for our overall customer base experiencing this benefit. And so we have a lot of conviction that this is going to be a step change improvement. Our customers will experience it and it's going to be a significant help in terms of driving churn down. Add to that, as the FirstNet deployment happens, as we're getting this kind of performance, we have some fairly strong expectations on customer adds from FirstNet. So the gross ad engine if you will, the customer ad engine we think FirstNet is going to be a significant driver of customer additions as we move into second third and fourth quarter of this year. So we have some high expectations of what we're doing on the network that this is - this is important, it's unique, it's differentiated and it's going to drive serious customer impacts as we get into the year. Walter Piecyk : Thanks for that color on timing. Also just a second question, I want to go back to the Investor Day, on the Entertainment Group, you had that nice slide that showed you - showed how you're going to stabilize EBITDA 10 billion, one of the things at the bottom with the video services going to maintain a $25 million from the start of \u201818 to the end of - the end of \u201919, or excuse me end of \u201818 to the end of \u201819. Is that really necessary to hit your $10 billion target and because giving kind of a sub losses this quarter and kind of what you're talking about as far as the impact of promotions it seems like that might be challenging to hit. So is it really necessary to hit $25 million subs in order to generate $10 billion of EBITDA on the Entertainment Group? Randall Stephenson : Yes. If I could bring some clarity to that Walter and that is a big part of that $25 million was WatchTV, which is our very low-end content offering for our mobile subscribers and that's a very low ARPU product, but it's a profitable product and it's one that we expect there will be a lot of those added during the course of the year. There are 500,000 of those accounts established right now. We're not yet calling them subscribers till we see behaviorally how they engage with the product and what kind of profitability we have. But that is a significant part of the $25 million. We do expect some continued obviously losses on the linear video. We talked about that. And we will achieve EBITDA stability even with the continued attrition of our traditional linear video subscribers. Does that help? Walter Piecyk : It does. Thank you very much. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Okay, so listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. \u201818 was a solid year. It was basically doing what we told you we were going to do at the analyst conference. And as I mentioned at the outset, I feel like we can check the box, we are doing exactly what we said. We feel very good about getting to 2019 and stabilizing enterprise Entertainment Group EBITDA margins. We feel really good about the wireless business. It's a year of execution, delivering on cash flow and delivering on debt pay down and delivering returns of capital to our shareholders. So we thank you for joining us and look forward to speaking with you later. Thanks a lot. Michael Viola : Thank you, all. John Stephens : Thanks, everybody.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d also like to remind you that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter conference call. As Greg said, I'm Mike Viola, I\u2019m Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Rand Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Rand is going to provide an update of the key 2019 initiatives, then John is going to cover our operating results. Then, of course, we will follow that with a Q&A. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions, spectrum auctions 101 and 102, so we can't address any questions about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the IR page of the AT&T website, and that includes the news release, investor briefing, 8-K, associated schedules, etcetera. And so now, I'd like to now turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And we do appreciate you joining us this morning. I came to you back in January and I outlined six priorities for 2019, and we have those again listed on the third slide. But if I could quickly summarize, what I would tell you is in all six of these areas we're either on track or well ahead of schedule. And the first one, as you remember, I told you that paying down the $40 billion in debt that we took on to acquire Time Warner that that would be our top priority, and we are on target to retire 75% of that by year-end. This quarter, we generated free cash flow of $5.9 billion and brought our net debt down by $2.3 billion. And that puts us well on track for generating at least $26 billion of free cash flow for the full-year. And then already here in the second quarter, we\u2019ve sold our stakes in Hulu and Hudson Yards. That generated an additional $3.6 billion of cash. And then John Stephens\u2019 team is doing their typical great job. They\u2019re driving down working capital and restructuring some collateral arrangements, and this is also adding significant cash flow and it\u2019s giving us very clear line of sight to reaching our target of $6 billion to $8 billion from asset monetizations, so bottom line, we committed to driving our net debt to EBITDA ratio to around 2.5x by year-end, and we are right on track for achieving that. Second priority was mobility, and we had another really strong quarter, and it continues to grow and build momentum with customers. Our wireless service revenues increased by 2.9%. EBITDA grew and that\u2019s even with some significant accounting pressures. Our postpaid and prepaid phones grew very nicely and churn remains low across both products. So, all in all, I'd have to tell you, I\u2019m very pleased with our wireless performance. And then stabilizing profitability of our entertainment group, this was a must do for us this year. And John Donovan and his team are exceeding expectations. And not only are they stabilizing EBITDA, but they\u2019re growing it by nearly 7%. There was a small one-time item in there from a carriage dispute settlement, but even removing that, growth was very healthy, I think around 5% excluding that. And so, that was led by 8% growth in broadband revenues. I got to tell you our fiber product, the AT&T fiber product is doing very well in the marketplace. On the cost side, the team is doing terrific work on controlling content costs, promotion costs, and all the other operating costs. And then, finally, some aggressive customer segmentation and targeting are driving some higher video ARPUs. And so, I think what you should expect is as we work through the year, we will continue to see declines in traditional TV subs, particularly those areas where we can't bundle with broadband, but as we get into the second half of the year, we roll out our thin client video product. There will be a much lower price product in the marketplace. What I think you'll see is subscriber losses should lessen as we get into 2020. And then I think the DIRECTV NOW customer base, that\u2019s our streaming over the top product. That should be pretty stable for the rest of the year. We might see some slight customer losses in the second quarter as the price increases continue to flow through. The second half of the year should be decent. Bottom line, I remain comfortable that we are either going to meet or exceed our entertainment group EBITDA target for the full-year and that\u2019s going to lay the groundwork for continued stability as we move beyond 2019. At WarnerMedia, it's been a really strong start to the year. Revenue growth was solid. Operating income grew by double digits. Our merger-related synergies are on track and we expect to hit $700 million in run rate by the end of this year. Stankey and his team have reorganized the business to compete in a world of streaming and streaming content. We brought in some great new talent, like Bob Greenblatt. He is a known commodity. He is running WarnerMedia Entertainment, and is also leading the SVOD development project for us. And I got to tell you, I think he is one of the best around and I couldn't be more excited to have him on board. Bob and his team's top priority is to develop our new SVOD service. And as we\u2019ve discussed, this is a service that will be centered on HBO and significantly enhanced by the Warner Bros. library, which is a very, very deep and prolific library. The closer we get to launching this service, the more excited I get. We are planning a WarnerMedia Day for everybody in the September to October timeframe, and we\u2019re bringing all the executive team across from WarnerMedia and we're going to give you a detailed look at the product, and that includes the breadth of new and existing content. So just stay tuned for that and we're making significant investments here and we think our customers are going to love this product. Now every facet of our strategy is built on a foundation of world-class connectivity. And a few years ago, we set out to build the best video delivery platform in the world, and we invested billions of dollars securing spectrum licenses, and we made it among our highest priorities to go after and to win FirstNet. That\u2019s the national network for first responders. And today, our FirstNet build has now passed the halfway mark and it is running well ahead of schedule. We now have more than 7,000 agencies signed up across the country with more than 570,000 subscribers, and those numbers are growing. This initiative along with our vast portfolio of spectrum has catapulted AT&T into the leadership position in network quality. Over the last few months, AT&T has been recognized as both the best as well as the fastest wireless network, and FirstNet has enabled us to accelerate our 5G and fiber build out. Our 5G service is now in parts of 19 cities and we will have 5G coverage nationwide next year. We are the only carrier to offer 5G service to businesses and consumers, and we're well ahead of our competition here. And our AT&T fiber network now surpasses 20 million locations, that's both consumers and businesses. And in short, our network investments are paying off and we're not done yet. Finally, Brian Lesser and his team continue to grow Xandr, that's our advertising business. Revenues were up 26% including the AppNexus acquisition. They had strong EBITDA margins and we're continuing to invest in new product development capabilities as we integrate more of Turner's ad inventory. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making. Our strategy is working. Our key initiatives are on track and you can expect strong execution on these priorities as we continue in the quarters ahead. And so, with that, I\u2019m now going to turn it over to our CFO, John Stephens, and he'll take you through the results. John Stephens : Thanks, Randall, good morning, everyone. Again, thanks for being on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Adjusted EPS was $0.86 in the quarter. WarnerMedia continues to be accretive. Mobility is adding customers and we saw EBITDA growth in our Entertainment group. Offsetting these positive signs was about $400 million non-cash impact from the reversal of rev rec and fulfillment deferrals. We expect those headwinds to continue throughout the year and we\u2019ve included all those in our guidance. Adjusted earnings included a higher interest expense from the Time Warner acquisition and the non-cash impact of lower capitalized interest as we continue to put additional spectrum into service in our mobility business. During the quarter, we also had a mark-to-market adjustment to our pension plan based on our expected distributions for the coming year. The $0.05 impact reflects lower interest rate even though we significantly exceeded our returns on plant asset assumptions. Consolidated revenues came in at $44.8 billion, up 18%. Thanks mostly to the acquisition of Time Warner. The gains in mobility service revenues, WarnerMedia and broadband were offset by a foreign exchange impact of approximately $550 million and lower U.S wireless equipment sales of about $175 million as well as a little bit of ongoing legacy product pressure. When you look at our pro forma basis, revenues were down slightly due entirely to the impact of foreign exchange and lighter equipment revenues. Without those impacts, revenues were up. Operating income showed solid growth and adjusted consolidated operating margins were 21.4% or up a 170 basis points with strong growth in the WarnerMedia and mobility and significant improvement in our Entertainment group. EG's first quarter EBITDA puts us in solid shape to meet or be our full-year EBITDA target for EG. Our cash flows also continued to be impressive. Let's look at those in Slide 6. Both our cash from operations and free cash flow saw strong growth. Cash from operations was up 24%, mostly reflecting WarnerMedia. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations obviously made an impact. For example, our securitization efforts got a lift to more than $1 billion from adding WarnerMedia to our program. This helped to overcome $700 million in pressure from income taxes, where in the first quarter of last year we received a significant refund from the December 2017 passage of tax reform. When you look at our free cash flow for the past 12 months, we are well over $25 billion. And with a full-year of Time Warner, we have confidence in meeting or exceeding our $26 billion range cash flow guidance. Our dividend payout of free cash flow was about 63% in the first quarter, another healthy amount. We also continue to invest at high levels. Our reporting CapEx was $5.2 billion and total capital investment was right at $6 billion when you include $800 million of payments from vendor financing arrangements. We have been receiving favorable payment terms from several suppliers, which allow us to be more efficient with our spending. And you see that at our capital investment in the quarter. We had $700 million of equipment assets put in the service during the first quarter that we won't have to pay for and aren't included in our CapEx number because of these new vendor financing activity. As a reminder, payments made under our vendor financing obligations are classified in the cash flow statement as financing activities, not investing activities. I will get into more detail about our leverage little later, but our net debt declined a solid $2.3 billion in the quarter. In addition to strong free cash flow in the quarter, we amended many of our collateral support agreements with our lenders, which allows us to reclaim most of the collateral posted for our foreign currency hedges. The net result was more than $1 billion in cash return to us, fully offsetting our vendor financing payments. And we don't expect to post much additional collateral during the five years of these arrangements. In fact, we expect to get another $300 million or more in collateral return to us in the second quarter. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with communications on Slide 7. Mobility turned in another solid quarter with service revenue growth, solid margins and postpaid and prepaid phone growth. Our Entertainment Group got off to a good start and stabilizing EBITDA for the year. In fact, we grew at nearly 7% in the quarter, thanks to broadband revenues growing more than 8% and tight cost controls. In fact, our broadband growth exceeded our legacy revenue change in the quarter. Communication revenues were up slightly when you exclude lower equipment revenues from the fewer smartphone upgrades. And margins were up 20 basis points even with the accounting headwinds and lower business wireline EBITDA. Business continues to be impacted by legacy declines and then transition to a low margin services. The first quarter had a tough year-over-year compare and this year we had higher deferral amortization and a wholesale business customer default, but we still posted $2.5 billion of EBITDA for the quarter. Now let's take a deeper look at our mobility results on Slide 8. Solid service revenue growth drove wireless revenue gain even as equipment revenues get to lowest upgrade rate in our history. Service revenues grew by nearly $400 million or 2.9% in the quarter and EBITDA grew by about 2% even with non-cash accounting headwinds of $200 million and subscriber gains in postpaid and prepaid phones. We grew postpaid phone net adds by 80,000 in the quarter, a significant improvement compared to a year-ago and FirstNet continued to be a tailwind to customer growth. In prepaid, we had 85,000 phone net adds, our 17th consecutive quarter of growth. We continue to be strategic here as well, focusing on the high-value prepaid market. Cricket is our flagship brand in prepaid. It generated strong subscriber growth and had its lowest ever quarterly churn rate of less than 3%, down more than 60 basis points year-over-year. Prepaid revenue growth was solid, up more than 6%. We now have more than 10 million Cricket subscribers, double what we had when we acquired the company in 2014 with more than 17 million total prepaid customers under the umbrella of AT&T. Randall already mentioned our many network achievements, but I will also point out that the percentage of new FirstNet customers is shifting to more customers new to AT&T and fewer migrations. Let's now look at our Entertainment Group results on Slide 9. The headline in Entertainment Group is growing EBITDA and operating contribution. And we\u2019re confident, we will meet or exceed our target of stabilizing EG EBITDA for the full-year. EBITDA grew by more than $180 million and margins expanded by 180 basis points to 24.7%, reversing a trend that we saw last year as the chart shows. A few things drove that improvement. First was good expense control both on content cost moderation from some recent renewals and operational cost such as lower advertising expense and promotional spending. Also we had a one-time settlement of a prior year carriage dispute that help the first quarter by about $40 million. So even without that one-time event, we had growth of over 5%. Third, our video ARPU increased as we focused on higher value customers, reduce promotions and move our pricing to market for both premium at over the top service offerings. Advertising revenues also continue to grow. Our premium ARPU grew for the first time in five quarters, up more than 2% and DIRECTV NOW ARPU was up more than $10 year-over-year. The number of premium TV customers on a 2-year price lock promotion declined by about 700,000 in the quarter. We still have about 1.6 million customers left on that pricing and we work through those for the rest of the year. Our focus on -- is on the long-term value customers. Secular declines and pricing moves we've made, did results in fewer gross adds and 544,000 fewer video subscribers. Changes to packaging and pricing in DIRECTV NOW impacted over the top net adds as well, but was significantly less than the fourth quarter. Broadband revenues grew by more than 8% and contributed to EBITDA stability and growth. We\u2019ve seen continued ARPU improvement in both video and broadband for the past year, helping us stabilize and grow EBITDA. We expect IP broadband ARPU growth to continue, but somewhat more moderate rates as we lap the step up that we saw in the second quarter of last year. We gained nearly 300,000 AT&T fiber customers in the quarter, bringing the total in service to more than 3 million and we now passed more than 12 million customer locations with fiber. For the quarter, we added 45,000 broadband customers. During the quarter, we updated our billing process for the premium video and broadband customers. Customers are now billed and receive service for the full month when they stay -- when they are in the last month of service, which is consistent with our content cost and mobility customer policies as well as the rest of the industry. This generated additional revenues for us and gave us additional time to win back customers. Customers in service at the end of the period were higher because of this change, about a 117,000 subscribers in premium TV and 38,000 in broadband. We expect the video net add challenges we saw in the first quarter will continue. Achieving EBITDA growth in the first quarter was a tremendous accomplishment for our Entertainment Group team. We continue to have confidence that we will meet or exceed our EBITDA target for the full-year. Let's move to WarnerMedia's first quarter results, which are on Slide 10. WarnerMedia continues to exceed our expectations and had a strong start to the year. Revenue growth was up more than 3% and operating income once again showed double-digit growth and nearly 12% with gains in all three units, and WarnerMedia continues to be accretive to both earnings and free cash flow. Warner Bros revenue grew by nearly 9%. Theatrical revenues increased primarily due to carry over revenue from Aquaman. Television revenues increased primarily due to higher initial telecast revenues. HBO revenues declined mainly related to a carriage dispute with one our distributors, but still realized operating income growth for the quarter. HBO's operating income was up due to lower programming costs. We continue to increase investment in high quality content. However, programming costs declined primarily due to the timing of content releases and some lower amortization expense. Turner revenues were down slightly, subscription revenues continue to grow. Thanks to higher domestic affiliate rate. But this revenue growth was offset by ad revenue declines, primarily from the every other year shift of the NCAA Final Four games. We are the Final Four games in the first quarter last year and reported all that ad revenue. This year CBS reported that. in years which CBS broadcast the Final Four games, we reported our share as participation interest not as ad revenue. That explains the difference, virtually all the difference in our ad revenues. With that, Turner's operating income was up 7%. WarnerMedia set for a solid year with final season of Game of Thrones is underway and viewership is breaking records. More than 17 million people turned in for the season premiere and to date more than 27 million people have watched the episode. In fact, we added more HBO Now subscribers in the week leading up to the Season 8 premiere of Game of Thrones than in any other week in the services history. Those numbers will show up in the second quarter customer accounts. We also had another successful airing of the March Madness, the NBA playoffs are going full steam on TNT. Warner Bros. Shazam! open earlier this month and is doing well at both the domestic and international box office. And later this year, we have our next Godzilla movie. It, Chapter 2 and the Joker, to name just a few of the great movies slated to be released. Now let's look at Xandr and Latin America results on Slide 11. Still very much in the early days for Xandr, but it continues to execute and expand. Revenues were up more than 26%, including AppNexus, our strongest first quarter growth in the last three years. Growth rate in this business tend to be seasonal and event driven such as election days with growing growth ramping throughout the year. EBITDA margins continued be strong and we continue to invest in developing our advertising platforms. We are making progress, integrating the Xandr marketplace across all of AT&T. Xandr is now helping optimize Turner inventory. Xandr will also be working with Viacom as a result of our recent content negotiations, so we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019ve discussed many times the potential joint benefits of blending premium content with our data and distribution to take advantage of targeted and relevant advertising opportunities. These agreements can help distributors, content providers and most importantly, help our customers. Turning to Latin America, we continue to deal with foreign exchange and local economy challenges. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were down year-over-year, primarily due to those pressures. But on a constant currency basis and excluding Venezuela, revenues would have grown .3% on a comparable basis. In Mexico, we saw solid service revenue growth, which was offset by lower handset sales in the quarter. We are making good progress on our goal to achieve profitability in Mexico. We still have plans for more improvement, EBITDA improved by $58 million year-over-year. We are improving operating income and maintain line of sight for EBITDA to breakeven in the second half of the year. Coming into 2019, we adjusted our subscriber base in Mexico to reflect the impact of a double count from certain third-party distributors and the sunset of 2G services. We continue to take operational steps to improve the quality of our sales and profitability. This includes focusing on higher value customers, adjustments to dealer commission structures, reduction in the subsidies and targeted price increases. Each of these changes improves the long-term value of our business, but puts pressure on volume comparisons. Even with our focus on higher value customers, we continue to grow our subscriber base of nearly 18 million subscribers. Given our focus on quality, we expect to see continued net add growth as churn improves. Foreign exchange significantly Vrio [ph], but revenues were flat sequentially. If you look at the results in constant currency, revenues were up year-over-year and the business continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flow. The beginning of the year, customer base was adjusted for the prior year after we identified and shut off a group of nonpaying customers. Vrio net adds were down, but our total subscriber base remain stable from a year-ago. Now before we get to your questions, let me give you an update on deleveraging, that's on Slide 12. As you know, our goal is to get to the 2.5x net debt to EBITDA range by the end of this year through free cash flow, asset sales and overall cash management and we are off to a really good start. First, our free cash flow, working capital and collateral agreement initiatives help us reduce net debt by $2.3 billion in the first quarter. Remember, the first quarter is usually our toughest quarter for free cash flow. We still expect our free cash flow after dividends to generate about $12 billion this year and expect to use it to pay down the debt. Second, we\u2019ve significant asset sales that put us well on our way to our asset monetization target. And it includes the sale of our interest in Hulu for $1.4 billion, which closed on April 15 and the pending $2.2 billion sale of our interest in Hudson Yards, which was just announced. This puts us in solid position to meet our leverage target of the 2.5x range by the end of the year. We are sharply focused on this. The teams have done a superb job so far and we expect that to continue through the rest of this year. Mike, with that, we're ready to take some questions. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, John. Greg, we will start with the Q&A and we will take our first question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple of questions on EG. First, maybe for John, the 5% growth, the adjusted growth on EBITDA was quite a bit better than we thought, and we were led to believe given the price changes that you would actually see improving trends later as the year progressed versus the first year. So, would it make sense? I know you didn\u2019t really change guidance, you said there could be some upside, but how should we think of the cadence of that as some of these price increases work through the system there. And then, maybe drilling down on the traditional sub losses. I guess, we get some -- we understand how NOW is going to continue to moderate given what\u2019s going on with Game of Thrones in HBO. But on the traditional side, we\u2019re using 661 for losses this quarter, given the $117,000 sub adjustment. First of all, is that the way to look at that? And then Randall, in your remarks, you said things would improve in the second half. And John, during your remarks you said that you'd still expect to see challenges. What is the cadence of that? Should we be using the 661 this quarter as the base of losses going forward? And the 1.6 million still on promo, what\u2019s the cadence of those guys coming off and adding to churn? Just how should we think of that line going forward? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes. So, John, let me try this. Let Randall kind of clear up what maybe I don\u2019t make clear. First, on EBITDA, it was really great growth. We did have -- as we mentioned, one-time adjustment was about $40 million, but the EBITDA growth was close to $200 million. So, it was only a small part of it. So it was really good. What -- that growth, and we're pleased and have confidence that we\u2019re going to meet our goal of stability. We are not raising our guidance, but as Randall said and I repeated, it's clear that we're on line of sight to not only meet but exceed that target, so we are just being careful with our representations going out. John Hodulik : Got it. John Stephens : We will continue to balance things and continue to measure costs, and go after high value customers, so we are leaving ourselves that flexibility, but we are clearly on track. I wouldn't suggest to you that you can draw a straight line out, but I feel really good about where we\u2019re on EBITDA growth. So, that\u2019s my best attempt to make a direct answer. We feel very good about it. We continue to expect to meet our guidance. At this stage, I understand why you would think we're going to exceed it, we'll let that happen. We are going to stick with our guidance as it is today with the understanding that we're outperforming on many respects. With regard to the sub losses, I think of it as a -- the 544 is the right number. I understand we pointed out the change in the billing [ph], but remember that's just an item that continually gets refreshed and it\u2019s always out there. So it's not a loss each quarter or an adjustment each quarter. In the second quarter, it just refreshes itself. So, it's kind of just the timing item on a one-time basis. Secondly, we did price increases on an annual basis in January. So that affected. All the customers got some price increase, that affected the linear. And we had about 700,000 customers impacted by the 2-year price lock. As we go through the year, we won't have another annual price increase per se. So that will have a -- that impact on customer accounts won't necessarily be there in that light. And then, secondly, as we get through now down to about 1.6 million at the beginning of the year 2.4 million on the price locks, as we get through the rest of those, we'll see less and less impact from those just because we get through the process. We expect that process to continue through November, which is the 2-year anniversary the last time we had an offer on this, but we'll see a lot of that activity going through in the second quarter. That's the difference between the first quarter and the rest of the year in the sense of the annual price increase as well as the largest group of the 700,000 customers hitting by the 2-year price lock. Randall, what would you want to add? Randall Stephenson : Yes, on the subscriber losses, I\u2019ve said particularly on DIRECTV NOW, our streaming product, that we\u2019ve put the price increases and we\u2019ve seen the effect of that in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Second quarter, you'll see that moderate, and I actually believe second half of the year based on what we're seeing in terms of uptake in the market on the new platform and the new product, and we should have a decent second half of the year on DIRECTV NOW. On the traditional premium product DIRECTV, I said you should expect continue to see losses as we move through this year, but we will be launching second half of the year the thin client, which think of that is our satellite replacement product. And why this is so important? It allows us to get into the market at a lower price point. When you look at the DIRECTV churn, it's interesting. What you see is not people at the high end in terms of ARPUs that are churning. It's disproportionally at the low end and where we don't have broadband. And so this thin client gives us an opportunity to meet that low end with a better price point and this should start to moderate the subscriber losses. And particularly as we get into 2020, we think this product is going to have a really good appeal for people down market in terms of their expectations of video pricing. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks, guys. Michael Viola : Greg, we will take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first kind of a bigger picture question with respect to the DTC strategy, Randall, or John Stankey, if he's on. A couple of weeks ago we saw Disney launch a DTC product or announce a launch with lower-than-expected pricing, bigger than expected losses. Numbers came down and the stock jumped 10% because people were looking at this as kind of a standalone Netflix being incubated inside Disney. And I was wondering if you guys could kind of address how you guys think about how the market would react to a similar announcement at AT&T? And if you could at this stage kind of dissect a little bit about what you think is good and strong about the Disney platform announcement and what maybe vulnerable about their approach and opportunities you see for yourself to come into that market. I guess, kind of on a related topic, could you talk a little bit about what if anything the Hulu sale might mean to the financials of the business. My guess is that you'll kind of see less losses from that flowing through to the earnings statement? And if you could kind of size that, that will be helpful for us. Thanks so much. Randall Stephenson : David, this is Randall. On Hulu, fewer losses and less capital requirements. So -- but we received $1.4 billion in cash and we're no longer in it, and so the capital goals go away, obviously. So on the Disney launch, yes I was impressed by what Disney did. I was -- also I thought the market reaction was an indication that people look at what Disney would be able to bring to market in terms of original content, library of content, deep strong brand content and new and original content and talking about the licensing that they would be pulling back in and I think what it did is gave the market an appreciation that this is a viable direct-to-consumer product, that will have good appeal for a broad number of customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world. And so I thought it was very instructive from that standpoint. From our standpoint, you'd be able to formulate your own opinion in September, October about what will be bringing to bear. But in terms of premium content, think about the HBO brand. In terms of breadth of content, consider the Warner Bros. library and the depth of that library, the new original content creation machine at Warner Bros., which is really an impressive scale machine in terms of producing theatrical as well as TV productions. And we're actually quite optimistic that we have something from both a magnitude of content, breadth of content, depth of content, new and original generation creation capabilities that we believe we can bring to market and will have significant customer uptake. And we will lay out for you those details in terms of what we think that looks like, what our expectations are for this product, including pricing and so forth. We are not ready to fully disclose all that yet. There's a lot of work being done. Bob Greenblatt is just getting his hands into this and working at aggressively. But I will tell you we're very, very optimistic and the Disney announcement gave us nothing, but more optimism in terms of what we think we will be able to bring to market. David Barden : Thanks, Randall. Randall Stephenson : Thank you, David. Michael Viola : Okay. Greg, we will take the next question. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could turn to wireless. Perhaps you could just update us on the outlook on the wireless service revenues for the rest of the year, another good performance and the ads turning around despite churn continuing to be a little bit higher year-over-year. So talk us through the network improvements how you\u2019re going to market to take advantage of that, and how that should shape during the year-end? Any updated color on the 5G rollout? We haven't really seen a lot on the commercial site. So when do we see more kind of opportunities in terms of pricing plans and so forth? Is that when the sub 6 gigahertz chipsets come out? Thanks. John Stephens : Sure, Simon. Let me take a run at it and ask Randall back me up. But first on the wireless revenue outlook continued to be positive. I stand by our guidance, and expect new service revenues. We had a great growth almost 3%, 2.9% in the first quarter. I will point out that last -- second quarter is when we saw some service revenue growth. So our compares get a little tougher in the second quarter and then a little bit more tough in the third quarter next year because of the growth we\u2019ve last year, but that\u2019s how I will still expect to grow it. It just has little tough compares, that's one. Two, why do we expect to grow? Because we do expect customer net adds. This first quarter was the first time in, I think, five years we had positive postpaid phone growth and solid prepaid phone growth. I think probably close to 170,000 or so voice that adds in the first quarter. In total, it's really great number for us and a game changer shows the impact we\u2019re having in the marketplace. So we feel good about the momentum coming out of that and that opportunity going forward. I will give you a sidebar. Our reseller losses were small as they\u2019ve been in the years -- in quarters, I should say, excuse me. So that\u2019s even showing an impact on that revenue -- that service revenue item. From a network improvements perspective, Randall mentioned the multiple awards that we're getting. Anybody's heard Mike and I do presentations know that we test the speeds walking down the hallways before our presentations and it's working. We get emails from investors and so forth. So it's having a real impact that we believe is impacting our ability to gain and retain customers. It's going to take a while to make sure we get that story fully understood. It's -- I mean, it takes a while to convince people, so we're optimistic that we will see the benefits that later in the year. We are at 53% of our network build out for FirstNet as of the end of the first quarter. We expect to get to 60% clearly by the end of the third quarter because that\u2019s the next billing milestone and payment milestone with FirstNet authority. And as we\u2019ve told you, we expect to reimburse -- first reimburse going to get that done. Now we expect to do that. We are well ahead of schedule. Team is doing a great job in that. Putting all that spectrum into use at once maybe caused some interest expense pressure, but it's working and it's working in the quality of the network. 5G were at 19 markets today operational using that 39 gigahertz millimeter wave. I will tell you, we still have plans to get a couple hundred. We have, if you will, a couple hundred million on our 5G evolution network coverage by the end of this year, but end of next year we will have over 200 million of our POPS covered on a 5G network. So our plans for 5G are going quite well. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t expect that revenue to come until next year and the year after, but we are working on a number of things. Whether it's in the hospital, in core netting medical centers, or it's in the factories, whether it's doing a whole host of automated, if you will, campuses for our big customers, we are seeing lots of really good progress with that. But it -- from a revenue perspective for a company of our size, we're still -- we're very optimistic, we're leading in 5G, but we'll see those revenue impacts growing over next year into the 2020 one timeframe. Randall Stephenson : I would -- Simon, I would add that this is the wireless piece. The network quality piece is probably the area within our business where I take more satisfaction than just about anywhere else. And this has been a long time coming, we\u2019ve been investing billions. As you know, we\u2019ve invested tens of billions of dollars in building the spectrum portfolio, and so bringing on FirstNet and having the opportunity to begin turning up all that spectrum is we're going across the country and turning up FirstNet is having exactly the impact that we hoped it would have and it is changing the value proposition for our customers. The value proposition is now one of quality and speed and delivery of video and we're not going out doing a lot of aggressive promotions and we're not doing pricing to try to get customers to stay and come on to the network. It is happening just organically and by virtue of the strategy that we implemented. The 5G evolution of product that we have out there as we turn all this spectrum up and put the new technology on MIMO and so forth, our competitors hate it, but it is having exactly the effect that you wanted to have. Our customers see this tag and they go do a speed check and they\u2019re seeing 80, 90, 100, 150 meg speeds depending on where they are. It is truly a step change difference in product capability. And that its having exactly the effect that we had hoped. And so all the areas that I look at right now and say I am pleased with this is the number one area that I\u2019m most pleased with. Obviously, second would be getting the Entertainment Group EBITDA stabilized and actually growing and we\u2019re feeling really good about that as well. But this is really, really an important accomplishment for us. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Michael Viola : Thanks, Simon. Greg, ready for the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Hi, Phil. Philip Cusick : Can you -- two follow-ups. Can you dig first into the wireless growth and help us quantify what FirstNet is doing for the subline? And then, second, a follow-up on the video side. Can you expand on your relationship with the NFL, and particular on the exclusivity of Sunday ticket? Thank you. Randall Stephenson : Sure. Wireless growth, we -- we're having a lot of success with FirstNet even with only 50% of the nation now completed in terms of the network build. And you heard 570,000 subscribers and John articulated that we\u2019ve hit a threshold where more and more those are coming new on to the network, they\u2019re not just migrations on to our network. And what we are finding is the FirstNet community. We put some very attractive offers out there for their families. And so every FirstNet subscriber that comes on to the network, I think the latest number John is we\u2019re getting two \u2026 John Stephens : Yes. Randall Stephenson : \u2026 family members with it. And so, this is driving a not inconsequential impact on subscriber gains. The network quality being the best and FirstNet being a main driver of it. So FirstNet is going to be a very important strategic element for us for a number of years to come and we are -- we continue to be more enthused about it than when we want to bid and won the deal. In terms of the NFL, I think we're not allowed to discuss much, but the exclusivity should remain as we go forward on DIRECTV. You probably saw news that the NFL network was taken down on our U-verse network. And look, we're heavily invested in the NFL on DIRECTV, but we're limited to carrying the Sunday ticket just on DIRECTV. And so our customers that have a high affinity to the NFL, we tend to have them overall on DIRECTV. When you look at the NFL network, there's some costs attached to that. And when you consider the games on the NFL network or the NFL Draft, our customers can watch the NFL Draft on ABC, they can watch the Thursday night games on Fox, and so it's all stuff we carry and so the NFL network was for a product U-verse that was not allowed to carry the Sunday ticket. It just didn\u2019t really make sense to continue carrying it over there. So it will save some content cost and we will give our customers access to the NFL through other mediums. If they really are a NFL centric customer, we will move them to DIRECTV. Philip Cusick : Got it. Thank you. And at one point you had talked about bending the content cost curve on DIRECTV. You re-signed Viacom. Is there something coming that you think might bend that curve, or we should be looking at it sort of linear from here? Randall Stephenson : So we\u2019ve nondisclosures generally on these deals, but what I would tell you is that the content cost or the content deals that we\u2019ve negotiated over the last few months have all been curve benders. And we are -- we feel good about where we are coming in and I think the margins on Entertainment Group are reflecting that. So bottom line, I am satisfied with the progress that John Donovan and his team are making on the content deals are coming up and getting them re-crafted to make sure we can distribute them to all of our various platforms and controlling the cost curve. John Stephens : Remember Phil, the ability to work with them on -- that\u2019s not at all. The content distributors have more advertising minutes than we as the distributor do. So if we can use our advertising resources to increase our ARPUs and our advertising dollars, like you\u2019ve seen with Xandr's growth, and then we can offer that to the content guys. There is a different -- there is a solution to the situation where they can gain advertising revenues and not have that the content cost, but still the revenues for them, and both of us benefit as do the customers. And quite frankly, we are really excited about Viacom. As we said we're working at Xandr with Viacom on things just like that. So those solutions here that are to be mutually beneficial, all three of the parties, the distributors, the content providers and the advertisers. So, it's a lot of work we\u2019re doing and the team is doing a great job, but we believe that there are solutions here that makes sense for everybody. Michael Viola : Thanks, Phil. Greg, we will take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. On the slide where you show your fiber broadband net adds, what we can see is that there's been gradual improvement in that performance which makes sense because you\u2019ve been building out the fiber network. I was hoping you could give us just a little bit more insight into what\u2019s driving that? For example, to what extent has the mix of that then shifting from upgrades to maybe winning new customers. How do you see that trending as you complete the fiber build out? And if you can give us any insight into the success you've had at bundling that fiber with some of your other products, that will be really helpful. Thank you. John Stephens : Yes. So, Brett, let me take a shot at it. And I appreciate you bringing this up, because I should dovetail this in -- for our prior question. When you look at the Entertainment Group margins in total, broadband is really a driver. Broadband is really a grower. If you remember my comments, broadband growth this year-over-year quarter exceeded the challenges, the headwinds we faced from the local voice of the other equipment revenue. So that's actually -- when you put broadband there, broadband's growth exceeded that. So broadband, specifically fiber derivative is doing well. And it is -- and it itself is helping drive EBITDA margin improvement at Entertainment Group. That's one. Two, we will continue to see some revenue growth on broadband throughout the year, just like wireless compares get a little bit more challenging in the second and third quarters, but we still -- we still expect to see ARPU growth and revenue growth. So feel really good about that. Yes, you're right we\u2019ve kept that about 25% of the available fiber out there. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent and no matter how much more we put out a 1 million or 1.5 million a quarter, we continue to immediately utilize 25% of that, because we've continue to add capacity and we will finish off adding that capacity at least from the FCC requirements we have in July. We will then start to further penetrate that market. So we feel like we will be able to grow it. If you think about the timeframe, keeping up at a 25% is a pretty good penetration rate when you continue to add as much fiber as we\u2019ve had. We see it in areas where we have the video, the wireless, the fiber together bundling is going well. It continues to give us an opportunity to participate and take market share in the broadband space. You are right, we continue to see on the early stages migrations of existing customers. But once again, as we get passed that that initial stage, we get in to be able to attract more and take share, which we\u2019ve said in the past and we will continue to see going forward. So with that being said, I expect we will get to around 14 million or maybe just under that range by the end of June and to July kind of the timeframe to fulfill our FCC requirement. That will give us 22 million customer locations in total. But that 14 million we'd expect to continue to see that 25% penetration very quickly and move up from there and get into a on par market share with our competitors as we take share or convert more customers. Let me stop at that and see Randall, if there's anything you want to add or anything I forgot? Randall Stephenson : No, I think you covered it well. This is probably one of the more exciting areas of the business in terms of where we have invested heavily and now we are seeing the fruits of the investment and getting to 25% penetration, that's almost mechanical. To be candid with you, whenever we go into a neighborhood and turn up fiber, 25% comes fast and 50% is eminently achievable. And we actually think we can hopefully get beyond 50% as we continue to get this build completed. And I\u2019m telling you where we get AT&T fiber, a video product and a mobile product, churn rates just drop. And the value effect of that is really, really powerful. Customers will love it and the services were all premium services and so this is going to be a really important element of us as we go through the rest of this year in 2020 in terms of keeping the Entertainment Group EBITDA stable. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Randall Stephenson : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormick from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Michael McCormick : Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the wireless business. It sounds like you guys grew -- you are fairly aggressive in 1Q on the buy one get one offers. Clearly FirstNet is having a positive impact, but how should we think about on a going forward basis through 2019 the appetite for that trade-off between promotional activity margin and phone net adds? And then, secondly on the broadband side, the active broadband side, could you give us a sense -- I know you\u2019re going to be laughing that allocation -- the revenue allocation change, how should we think about the spot pricing in broadband sort of today versus, say a year-ago.? Thanks. John Stephens : Let me take the first one. On the mobility margins and the perception of BOGOs and so forth, remember our equipment revenues are really down. So in -- so that may have an effect depending upon on how any of our promotions are done on the BOGO stuff, but let me say it this way. If you look at our results and you say service revenues were up about $375 million, $400 million, and our -- about $375 million and our EBITDA was about $130 million, $350 million. And then you say I had noncash accounting rev rec commission and amortization in the rev rec and so forth of about $200 million. Effectively, of that $375 million service revenue, $350 million -- or almost $350 million of it fell to the bottom line from making that accounting adjustments. So from that perspective, it won't be really effective at controlling cost, controlling promos, being prudent with advertising and promotional expense. So we feel good about the quality of our customer count net adds and the ability to do that. I mean, I understand your question, but I don't want to leave you with the impression that somehow -- this was a very thoughtful process and focused on value of customers. And we -- I believe we are really successful. So I would tell you that the value of FirstNet, the quality experience of the market and the opportunity it provides and further geographic coverage, and quite frankly we\u2019re putting more distribution points out there with opening new stores. But that's part of our investment that we're making that sometimes shows up in the expense line as opposed in the CapEx line. But we're expanding our stores in places where we have stores before. So all of that based on FirstNet, based on the solid very, very solid first quarter results, based on this expanded, if you will, geographic footprint and distribution footprint, we feel really good about wireless going forward. Randall Stephenson : That\u2019s the point John just made. As we build out FirstNet into these rural communities, as we deploy, we're turning up new distribution in these rural communities and these tend to be communities that have had one option for the last number of years. And we're having a lot of success as we move into the smaller communities, set up new distribution and taking market share. So that\u2019s just another side benefit of the FirstNet build. John Stephens : With regard to the IP broadband side, I just refer you to the kind of the ARPUs, I think that we got published out there with regard to this quarter being at about 50 -- little over 50 bucks on the broadband ARPU, it's about 8% growth. But if you compare it to next quarter you will see next quarter year-over-year -- we jump from first quarter to second quarter last year. And so that's all we\u2019re trying to tell you about. It's not a sensitivity at all about the success of the project. We feel really good about it and we do feel like as we get more of the fiber put in service. We have the opportunity to -- our customers will want higher-speed, and they will be willing to pay a fair price for those higher-speeds. So we are optimistic about it. We are just being careful from a numerical comparison perspective. If you look at the first quarter last year, both on wireless and on broadband to second quarter you saw a step up in those ARPU numbers, and we just want to make sure the compare is right. Michael McCormick : Very good. And Randall, can you maybe just comment, we\u2019re seeing a lot of price increases across the board and over the top streaming video products. How does DIRECTV now sort of set up against that and in this landscape how do you view price elasticity for your customer? Randall Stephenson : Yes, Mike, we made our move on OTT pricing and rationalizing the whole content lineup for our OTT product in the fourth quarter. And you've now seen most of the other players that have a streaming product out there follow. And I think we're getting to a place where the product, we all look at. So, okay, this is a sustainable place if you can get the advertising revenues to where we think we can get them. This was probably a sustainable level. It is as you're seeing highly price-sensitive. This is a segment of the market that had by and large left the linear product market, because of pricing. And so as we came in with a $40 product, you saw a significant uptake and it was largely people who had left the market. And as you begin to move the pricing and try to get the profit equation right, you saw some fallout, but now we're in the market at this $50 price point and we\u2019re early on in terms of getting the new platform out there. It came out I think very end of March, but we're seeing good uptake on the new platform, the new pricing. As I said during the second quarter, you may still see the OTT product to be negative in terms of subscribers, as we continue to experience price increases on the base. But what we're seeing on the uptake of the new product with a new price point is giving us confidence. So we get to the second half of the year, this thing ought to do decent growth. And so we're actually optimistic, but it is a very price-sensitive product, Mike. Make no mistake about it. Michael Viola : Thanks, Mike. Greg, we will take one last question. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi. Thanks and good morning. Two, if I could. First, as you look at the performance of full fiber subscribers when you made the upgrade relative to the implied decline of customers with DSL and fiber-to-the-node, how are you thinking about what portion of your homes ultimately need to get the full fiber capability and how quickly you want to get there. And then, secondly, you described the growth in fixed broadband ARPU as customers are buying up the higher-speed packages. Do you see a multiyear opportunity in the wireless segment to change the pricing model and charge higher prices for higher bit -- higher bit rate, especially as you introduce 5GE and then eventually full 5G? Randall Stephenson : Yes. On the 5G piece, Mike, I will be very surprised. If as we move into wireless, the pricing regime and wireless doesn\u2019t look something like the pricing regime you see in fixed line. If you can offer a gig speed, there are some customers that are willing to pay a premium for 500 meg to a gig speed and so forth. So I expect that to be the case. We are two or three years away from seeing that play out. Right now from a 5G standpoint, what we're seeing in terms of adoption tends to be business. In fact it's exclusively business for us right now. Its serving as a land replacement product and we're having really impressive demand where we turn up the 5G service from businesses basically saying, we want to put a router in, and it becomes their LAN replacement. And so now as you begin to think about equipment, whether it be handsets or tablets or laptops that have 5G modems within them, which that will happen starting this year and it really pick up over the next year, then that truly does become a LAN replacement. You don't even need the router at that stage. And so, the idea that just like business customers pay more for more speed in a fixed line environment, we expect that there is going to be demand and that there will be price differentiation for speed as you move into a 5G environment. In terms of fiber upgrades, we have as you know, over the last 3, plus 4 years have the most aggressive fiber deployment program probably in the United States. And so we've been going at a really hot rate in putting fiber out. As I mentioned earlier, I think it was to Mike McCormick's question, the adoption on fiber deployment in terms of taking market share and customer upgrades is fairly mechanical. It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out what this looks like as you deploy fiber. And so while we're going to kind of finish off this first phase of our fiber deployment between 5G and FirstNet and just our natural desire and preference for fiber on new builds, you\u2019re going to see fiber continue to be pushed into this network. And as business locations demand fiber, you\u2019re just going to see a capillary of fiber deployment continue over the next 4 or 5 years. And it's not going to go at the same pace you\u2019ve been seeing for last four, but it's going to continue. And I don't see that stopping. So I see our fiber opportunity just continuing to grow as we move 2020 through 2025. Thanks for the questions, Mike. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Michael Viola : Okay. Well, listen, I appreciate everybody joining us. And once again, punchline to this quarter is we have basically done exactly what we told you we would do at the Analyst Day and then again our January guidance. Debt reduction is right on track. Asset sales and asset monetizations are right on track. Our free cash flow forecast is actually ahead of schedule and Entertainment Group is on track and actually ahead of schedule as well. So stay tuned. We will be getting more details to you in terms of our WarnerMedia Day to come in September, October timeframe. And I appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you again. Thank you. John Stephens : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Just as a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rand will provide an update of our key 2019 initiatives, and John will cover our operating results. And then, we will follow that up with a Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we\u2019re in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 103, so we can\u2019t address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K, associated schedules, etcetera. And one more item before I turn it over to Randall, we\u2019ve scheduled our WarnerMedia Day for the afternoon of October 29 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. We will discuss more details on the new streaming service, HBO Max, and more details will come, but go ahead and mark your calendars. And so, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall Stephenson : Thanks, Mike. Good morning. The headline of the second quarter and the first half of the year is we\u2019re hitting each of our commitments we made for 2019, and you can see those on Slide 3. I\u2019ll start with our new leveraging plans, which are right on track. Since we close the merger last June, net debt is down $18 billion. We expect to further reduce net debt about another $12 billion in the second half of the year, and that should get us to a 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA range by year-end. And to the extent that we can overachieve on that objective, you can expect we\u2019ll take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year. Wireless is about half of our overall EBITDA and it continues to fire on all cylinders. Last quarter, we grew revenues, EBITDA, and phone subscribers both postpaid and prepaid. Wireless service revenues were up 2.4% in the second quarter and we\u2019re continuing to see the payoff on our investments with a world-class network. Our wireless network has been named fastest, the best and the most reliable by independent testing services. FirstNet continues to be the driver of our network performance as well as our 5G leadership. And at the end of the quarter, we were about 60% complete with our FirstNet coverage, ahead of plan. And we are now targeting 70% completion by year-end. And our FirstNet build is accelerating our 5G deployment, as we deployed FirstNet, we\u2019re installing hardware that can be upgraded to 5G with a simple software release. As a result, we\u2019re on track for nationwide 5G coverage by the first half of 2020. Turning to WarnerMedia, there was another strong quarter, merger synergies remain on track and we had solid operating income growth across all three business units. This was a record year, 191 Primetime Emmy nominations for WarnerMedia and HBO alone scored 137 nominations. That was the most in its history. So, what was the result of all of this? We had very strong HBO digital subscriber growth in the quarter, and we\u2019re setup really well for the second half of the year. Bottom line, HBO\u2019s stepped up investment in content is working. And this will be critical as we launched HBO Max next spring. And as Mike mentioned, we look forward to share a more about HBO Max in October. Our Entertainment Group continues to make solid progress, we didn\u2019t just stabilize EBITDA, we actually grew it by 1.1% in the quarter. Later this summer, we\u2019ll beta launch AT&T TV in a few markets, that\u2019s our live TV service over broadband. We have some really high expectations for this product, and we\u2019re going to learn from the pilot, and then we\u2019ll expand to more cities as we go to the year. IP broadband revenue growth remain strong, we continue to see a solid growth in our AT&T Fiber product. That product now reaches about 14 million customer locations or 22 million when you include businesses. So, all in all solid, steady progress against the commitments we made coming into the year. And appealing even more confident that we\u2019re going to meet or exceed each of those commitments for the full year. In fact, this morning, we\u2019ve raised our free cash flow guidance for 2019 to the $28 billion range, that\u2019s up $2 billion and we\u2019ve reaffirmed all of our other guidance for the year. So now for more detail on the quarter, I\u2019m going to turn this over to John, and he\u2019ll take you through the results. So, John? John Stephens : Thank you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. As Randall mentioned, we\u2019re on track with all our financial targets. And in many areas, we\u2019re ahead of plan. Adjusted EPS was $0.89 in the quarter, including $0.02 impact from a higher effective tax rate. We continue to expect low-single-digit growth for the full year, as we are set up for a solid second half of the year performance. We grew revenue both on a reported and pro forma basis in the quarter. In fact, all segments are growing on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points with the addition of WarnerMedia, strong growth in Mobility, and continued improvement in our Entertainment Group. Our cash flows were very strong on the quarter. Let\u2019s look at this on Slide 6. Cash from operations came in strong at $14.3 billion, that\u2019s up 40% and free cash flow was a record $8.8 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations made and impact, as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts. The securitization lifted free cash flow by $2.6 billion. Our ability to generate cash continues to be impressive. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve generated $29 billion in free cash flow or about $4 a share. With the benefit of our securitization efforts, we have confidence to raise our free cash flow guidance for the full year to the $28 billion range. Our strong cash position also allows us to continue to invest at industry leading levels. CapEx was $5.5 billion and total capital investment was $6.5 billion, when you include the $1 billion of payments for prior vendor financing activity. And we reduced net debt by $6.8 billion in the quarter. Let me speak more to deleveraging on Slide 7. We paid-off $18 billion in debt since we closed the merger, and we ended the quarter with our adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio at just under 2.7 times. This is down from 3 times leverage ratio, when we close the deal. And we\u2019re squarely on track to hit our year-end target of being in the 2.5 times range. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve reduced net debt by nearly $9 billion, that includes about $7 billion from free cash flow and nearly $4 billion in asset monetizations, offset by about $2 billion of vendor payments and other purchases of assets. And these sales have come from assets that contribute no EBITDA. Looking at the remainder of the year, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll hit our year-end leverage target. To the extent, we can overachieve with that target you can expect will take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year. Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. The story of our Communications segments this quarter is stable revenue [Technical Difficulty] EBITDA and margin growth, while adding phone subscribers. Our Entertainment Group is delivering EBITDA growth. And Business Wireline revenue trends improved in the quarter, thanks to strength in strategic and managed services and about $125 million from IP licensing. But even without those licensing proceeds, Business Wireline revenue trends were the best that we\u2019ve seen in years. And when you factor in strong Business Wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenue grew 2.3%. On the cost side between, the team is doing great work in controlling content, promotions and other operating costs. Solid cost management was evident throughout the business, especially in our Entertainment and Business Wireline units. Let me give you some more details starting with Mobility on Slide 9. Our Mobility business continues to perform very well. Service revenues grew by 2.4%, EBITDA growth was even higher at 3.1% and EBITDA margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 56.1%. We had a strong quarter with 355,000 phone net adds, including 72,000 postpaid and 283,000 prepaid. And we added 388,000 smartphones in the quarter further strengthening our customer base. Postpaid phone trend was up slightly to 0.86%, but was down sequentially. And at the same time, our prepaid business, especially Cricket continues to perform at strong consistent levels. Prepaid revenues were up nearly 10%, we had our 18th consecutive quarter of phone growth, and churn hit an all-time low at both cricket and AT&T prepaid. With the network leadership and FirstNet expansion that Randall talked about earlier, we\u2019re confident that our wireless business will get even stronger as we evolve to 5G. In short, our network investments particularly our spectrum deployment are paying off, and we\u2019re not done yet. Now let\u2019s go on to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 10. Our focus on long-term customer value continues to impact our Entertainment Group. EBITDA grew both year-over-year and sequentially. This was the second straight quarter of EBITDA growth. Year-to-date EBITDA was up about 4%. Expense reduction outpaced revenue declines, setting the stage for EBITDA growth. Broadband revenue growth helped us as well as continued growth in video ARPUs. The number of premium TV customers on the two-year price lock declined by more than 600,000 in the quarter. Video subscriber numbers were in line with what we said to expect for the quarter. Premium declined 778,000 and DIRECTV NOW declined 168,000. And as Randall mentioned earlier, later the summer, we\u2019ll begin piloting AT&T TV, our thin client broadband TV product, the best important milestone with our fiber deployment reaching $14 million customer locations, and satisfying our fiber build commitments. This will be an important driver of growth going forward. In fact, we had more than 300,000 AT&T fiber net adds in the quarter, and IP broadband revenue grew by 6.5%. We expect AT&T fiber penetration to grow as the service matures. Bottom line, we remain comfortable that we\u2019ll meet or exceed our Entertainment Group EBITDA that target for the full year. And lay the groundwork for continued stability beyond 2019. Let\u2019s move to WarnerMedias\u2019 results, which are on Slide 11. WarnerMedia continues to be free cash flow accretive. Our expense management with merger-related synergies are on track. We expect to hit a $700 million run rate by the end of this year. And HBO Max is slated to launch next spring. Overall, WarnerMedia had another strong quarter with 5.5% revenue growth and solid operating income growth. HBO revenues grew, thanks to strong content sales, driven by home entertainment and international licensing. Turner revenues were up about 2% on subscription revenue growth, and this includes the advertising impact of not having the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four championship this year. It will be back on Turner next year. And at Warner Bros., theatrical revenues increased due to home entertainment games and a highly successful release of Mortal Kombat 11, which drove game revenues. With that, Mike, we\u2019re now ready to take questions. Michael Viola : Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And looks like first, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open. John Hodulik : Great. Thank you. Maybe some questions on the Entertainment segment. And specifically, on the video subs. John, you said you\u2019ve got about another 1 million subs left on the promotions. When did those promotions expire? And maybe if you could comment a little bit on the programming disputes you\u2019re having with CBS and Nexstar. One, is this \u2013 is expectations for resolution there driving some of the belief and continued growth in EBITDA in that segment? And then, how do you expect that to impact the sub trends as we look into the second half of the year? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Hi, John. It\u2019s Randall. I\u2019ll take the carriage disputes that are going on with CBS and Nexstar first, and I\u2019ll hand it to John, let him just kind of reconcile the subscriber numbers for you. As everybody probably knows, CBS has pulled their signal off DIRECTV as has Nexstar. And there are two very different situations. On CBS, it\u2019s kind of an interesting situation. The bid asked candidly is not that wide. But it\u2019s kind of an interesting dynamic with them. We sent \u2013 that was a reasonable fair offer over five days ago, and it\u2019s been Cricket\u2019s. We haven\u2019t heard anything, haven\u2019t yet had a response to the offer. When you\u2019re as close as we are, we find a little interesting that we\u2019re still sitting here dark and not having interaction with CBS. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re probably distracted with other negotiations right now, but I don\u2019t know. Nexstar, it\u2019s a very different situation. Nexstar, as you know basically their product is broadcast, the four big broadcast stations free-over-the-air content, I might point out, and their opening bid in the negotiations like a 100% increase. And not only was it a 100% increase, but the assets that they\u2019re trying to acquire that they don\u2019t yet own yet. They were asking for a rather significant increase on assets they don\u2019t own. So, it began with kind of a nonstarter. They\u2019ve pulled their signal and gone dark. Now the spread is they\u2019re asking for a 50% increase on broadcast channels that again are free over the air. And so that one may take longer, but we\u2019ll just have to be a resolute on this one. We\u2019re just not going to impose those kind of price increases on our customers. And interestingly enough, unlike other times we have gone through these type of blackouts where companies have pulled their signal. Our customers and world of streaming are finding other ways to access this content. And so, there\u2019s other technologies, these technologies can even flow right into the programming guide in our DIRECTV lineup and some customers are at a pretty significant rate finding other ways of getting to that content, so that one could take a while. CBS, I\u2019m optimistic, but hopefully we\u2019re just going to back to the table and get this closed. John Stephens : John, taking that forward, we\u2019ve got about a 1 million customers left, as I mentioned on these price locks, and those price locks expire in the fourth quarter. Pretty much ratably I\u2019d say throughout the second half of the year. But in November, as they closed out, and we expect to have through the process by the end of this year, so we\u2019d expect to continue to see some of the impacts of getting to this value based long-term customer value approach that we\u2019ve taken on those customers and continue to see some of the same trends we\u2019ve seen. Additionally, we have \u2013 as you\u2019ve seen the EBITDA grow and the performance of the business being really solid, certainly stable, but solid in my mind. You can see that; we believe that this value of customer long-term value customer approach is working. So, on the intake side, we\u2019re going to continue to file that, and that will also continue to lead us to some working through the rest of this year. But that being said, we\u2019re encouraged about our early insights in the AT&T TV. We\u2019re encouraged about the ability to get out of the beta, learn from it, and take it forward the rest of this year. So, when I look at 2020, and we\u2019ve been through the two year price locks, we\u2019ve been through a full year of adding a long-term value based customer and we have the potential to use AT&T TV. We have more optimistic expectations for 2020 that gives us the basis to believe that our margins will continue to be stable next year. Randall Stephenson : And just most importantly, what John just went through is, as we come out of back end of 2019 and the customer base is cleaned up. We will have a customer base that is going to be perfectly suited for HBO Max. And we really had a really strong second quarter with HBO. And I got to tell you what we saw on HBO in the second quarter, particularly on the digital subscriptions that were added, we\u2019re gaining more and more confidence that this DIRECTV base, as we come out of 2019 is going to be ideally suited for driving HBO, HBO Max penetration as we launch that next year. John Hodulik : Thanks a lot, gentlemen. Randall Stephenson : Thanks for the question, John. We\u2019ll take the next question, operator. Operator : And next in queue, we\u2019ll go to the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Philip Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. Following up there, you\u2019ve given through the second quarter some thoughts about typical seasonality in video losses in 2Q versus 1Q, and it came through around that 100,000. How do you think about typical video losses in 3Q versus 2Q? And should we expect a continued sort of subdued level of promotion in video until you get to the wider AT&T TV launch? John Stephens : Yeah, Phil. I think, you should expect \u2013 as you call it subdued or what we call at the long-term value focus promotional activity, I think that\u2019s right. You should expect that. We have some normal summer activity with video, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change. What I would tell you though is the balancing of that with the same number of customers, the amount of customers getting off these two-year price locks. Putting that together, what I\u2019m trying to say is, we\u2019d expect this level of losses to continue and are predicting what they are, but we need to get through this 1 million customers base and some of the other, if you will, less the value-conscious-focused promotions that we\u2019ve done in prior years. We need to get through those that will take us through the end of the year to do that. The positive side of that is, I don\u2019t know what AT&T TV is going to do for us. I think, it\u2019s going to be a focus of real results in 2020, because we\u2019re going to roll it out later this quarter and then we\u2019ll test it. But you can be assured, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on this long-term value of the customer. Operator : And next up in queue, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Turning to the balance sheet on the buybacks, can you help us think about, how you\u2019re going to balance buybacks versus continued deleveraging once you get to the 2.5, where do you \u2013 where would you like to end up on the balance sheet and how are you going to divide your free cash flow between the two? And then if you could update us on the $6 billion to $8 billion of net asset sales, you\u2019ve obviously sold almost $4 billion already. But where do you see that trending at this point? Thanks. John Stephens : So, Simon, I want to take the asset sales first. Feel really good about where we\u2019re at. The \u2013 and I bucket them \u2013 I put them in two buckets. One is a straight asset sales, Hulu and Hudson Yards, and that was the $4 billion. But we\u2019ve also done a whole collection of other working capital impacts just like the WarnerMedia securitizations, a whole collection of that kind of activity. So, we feel really good where we\u2019re at. With regard to the asset sales, we\u2019re \u2013 I think, it\u2019s public knowledge that we\u2019re out there selling our collection of about 1,300 U.S. cell towers that we still have, we still own. We have a whole collection over a 1,000 cell towers in Mexico. We probably have 250 parcels of real estate with a couple of $100 million in the contract. We have an equity investment in the company called CME and their independent board is reviewing their strategic alternatives. So, we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that\u2019s not all of them, but we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that gives us confidence in meeting that $6 billion to $8 billion range, and hopefully doing very well with regard to that $6 billion to $8 billion target. And I\u2019ll remind you that that\u2019s on a net basis, too, so we\u2019re expecting to cover the investment we made in millimeter wave this year in the 24 auctions. So, the $6 billion to $8 billion target is going to include being to pay for that with the proceeds. We just got a lot of opportunities, we feel good about it, and I\u2019ll leave that with that. With regard to the balance sheet, I think, if you can think about as we talked about after \u2013 the fourth year after the close of the deal. We look to be \u2013 I\u2019d expect, we\u2019d be somewhere around the 2.0 range or below that gives us great flexibility to pay down debt and take advantage of what now is a higher cash cost of equity capital than the cash cost of our debt capital. So, when you look at out of very methodical basis, right now, the cash flows of the overall operation on an after dividend basis can be enhanced by shifting some of your focus from debt repayment to buyback. But I want to make sure, we stay focused on the fact that we\u2019re going to achieve, we expect to achieve our guidance. And we\u2019ll get there and that is our focus \u2013 primary focus right now to make sure we look [ph] that. We\u2019re well on track, we feel good. I think you can tell that just by the fact that we just raised our guidance on free cash flow. But that\u2019s how we think about it. So, these are historically low interest rate environment, and operating at these levels has been something we can very reasonably do, periodically we do and feel very comfortable about. Randall Stephenson : Thanks. Simon. Operator : And next up in queue, we have the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one would be it\u2019s been a while since the Business Wireline side surprised to the upside, and I think that you guys have been trying to kind of just maintain it, but is there something structural or competitively that has evolved it, might be \u2013 this might be the first data point in the trend? Or is it more of an anomaly? And then the second question, John Stephens, would be on the cash flow guide. Could you kind of parse down the increase in the free cash flow guidance? Is it related to lower CapEx, as you shift CapEx to vendor financing? Or is it related to the working capital benefits from the WarnerMedia asset sale or other things kind of that are going to come through the year? It\u2019d just be helpful to kind of get a picture of that. Thanks. John Stephens : So, they could \u2013 let me take that free cash flow one first. And quite frankly, we\u2019re at the $26 billion range, feel very good about that. We did $2.6 billion securitization that we told you about. And quite frankly some would suggest that raising the guidance to $28 billion could have been raised even higher number than the $28 billion range. But quite frankly, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the network, our FirstNet team, our network team is [putting for sales] [ph] quite frankly ahead of schedule. They\u2019re being really efficient. But if they need more capital, I want to have the flexibility to do that and still meet what we\u2019re \u2013 what our guidance is. If we can get software releases out quicker with regard to 5G, and put those in place, I want to retain the flexibility to do that. So quite frankly, the raise in guidance is something that\u2019s very reasonable to achieve, and feel good about it. And yet retains flexibility for us. So, I understand the reason for your question, but we have retained some flexibility in this to make sure that if we can continue to build at this \u2013 the 60% achievement level that we\u2019re at is nine months ahead of schedule. If we can keep doing this and the impacts of that overall wireless business are really showing up at lower churn in customer. We\u2019ve had a 1 million voice customers in the last year, 355,000 just in last quarter. So, feel really good about what it\u2019s doing. So, I want to be ready to support those really quality efforts, that\u2019s that aspect of it. Randall Stephenson : On the B2B front, Dave. This is Randall. Look, U.S. business is pretty healthy, U.S. business is doing very, very strong. And we\u2019re now into since tax reform, I think, like our six quarter of really healthy fixed investment for businesses. And that tracks really, really well with what we do. And it\u2019s been a little soft in the last quarter or two with the China trade discussions. The administration didn\u2019t like to \u2013 for us to talk about that, but look business has pulled in and best with the last quarter or so as a result of the trade uncertainty. But with all that said, it\u2019s been six quarters of pretty robust increase in business fixed investment and that tracks very well with us. Second is pricing has been pretty rational in this industry, and especially as we\u2019ve worked off a lot of those whole legacy products, we had this incredible pricing pressure. We\u2019re now in the market. What\u2019s growing are the new IP type services. And the pricing there in the marketplace has been pretty reasonable and stable, and the new products sets are doing well. You saw special service as we call them, but I think those were up 6% plus for the quarter, which is a really nice healthy growth rate for those. And then we had some IP sales in the quarter, and that profit up a little bit. So \u2013 but even without that, the trends are really, really strong here. We feel good \u2013 we feel about as positive on this segment as we have in quite some time. And as businesses keep investing, we\u2019ll continue to be really bullish on this segment. And the IP sales by the way, I mean, I know those are come in big blocks, but they\u2019re not one time. We\u2019ve had these in the past had a couple in this quarter, and we\u2019ll have probably, I suspect, more in the future that\u2019s become a nice little opportunity for us. And then, we haven\u2019t even talked about the Microsoft and the IBM deals that were announced just recently. And those are not inconsequential deals. Those have multifaceted implications. And predominantly, those deals addressed a particular area. The biggest cost item on AT&T\u2019s P&L are we call it the factory costs. But it\u2019s the network and the IT costs, the big iron costs. And as you have seen over the last few years, we have very consistently with all the activity in the network going on, we have very consistently driven those cost levels down on an absolute basis, 8%, 9%, 10% year-over-year very consistently. We\u2019re kind of getting to a place where it\u2019s hard to continue getting those type of productivity increases. What we\u2019re doing with both IBM and Microsoft is leveraging their capabilities in large scale cloud deployments. And they\u2019re taking over a lot of applications for AT&T, moving those to the cloud. And what is going to do is allow us to continue at this type of cost reduction curve on the network and IT side of the house, and continue that momentum there. In addition, we are securing revenue opportunities with each of those companies, and actually have go-to-market strategies. That will allow us to continue to keep the momentum you\u2019re seeing on the wireline revenue side. So, all in all, I would tell you, we\u2019re relatively bullish on the B2B side of the house, and hopeful that we continue to have economic growth, the trade situation doesn\u2019t become a distraction for businesses that we can continue and improve on this. John Stephens : Thanks, Dave. Randall Stephenson : Take the next question. Operator : Next up, we have the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. For the last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen a steady execution in the wireless business, and that\u2019s been without being fully deployed on FirstNet without really having had a chance to do a lot yet with 5G. But over the next year, both of those initiatives are going to be much more significantly deployed. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about your go-to-market in Mobility and whether you think over the next few quarters, there\u2019s an opportunity to maybe step on the gas a bit more? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Yeah. Thanks, Brett. This is Randall, again. Yeah, look the wireless side of the house, we are feeling more and more confident every day as we execute through the network strategy in the FirstNet strategy. And as you think about growth in the future, you hit on the key elements. FirstNet is just in its infancy, and we have a few hundred subscribers that have moved to FirstNet. The first responder community is a rather large market, and it\u2019s a market where we come into it with very small share. And so, our opportunity to grow share as we build out this First Responder Network is quite significant, and you\u2019re starting to see that play itself out. But that just as importantly is as we build out the FirstNet network, we\u2019re moving into markets where we have had a pretty thin presence in the past. These are rural communities. And as we move into these communities, we are standing up brand new distribution in many communities. And everybody on this call, who\u2019s followed this business for a while knows what the penetration numbers look like when a new entrant comes into a community. The first market share goes quick. It comes to you quick; we\u2019re starting to see that as we stand up distribution in new communities. And we\u2019re at the very front end of this as well as we told you, we\u2019re 60% built out on our coverage. We have 40% more to go. So, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity left here. And then the piece that\u2019s not inconsequential, in fact is probably the most important of all of this, is that AT&T now has claimed the network quality mantle. Network quality is ours, and we feel very strongly about this. And as I told you, we have been rated the best, the fastest and the high most reliable network by people who do this for a living on an independent basis. And as a marketing position, that\u2019s a great place to be. And we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of this in key segment customer churn, we\u2019re starting to see it in terms of gross add capability. And just having a strong network quality brand and message in the marketplace by itself is a growth strategy. And so bottom line, we\u2019re feeling pretty bullish about the wireless business right now. John, would you add anything? John Stephens : Brett, we think of the first responder community, has 3 million potential, to participate very little in that. We\u2019re growing it quickly now. But we also the secondary first responders, the guys who going in and restore power and restore hospitals, and work in that environment that don\u2019t necessarily wear firefighter hats or police badges, that\u2019s another 8 million or brings that total almost \u2013 that adds about 11 million to it. So that brings that community totaled about 14 million. That\u2019s a huge \u2013 that\u2019s the opportunity we view. And then you think about them having multiple devices whether it be a tablet or a phone, and then you think about them having family members. So, it really is a very large scale. We are making great progress in getting authorized with agencies and adding customers. And adding customers, that were previously served by somebody else, but we\u2019re also very, as Randall said, this network is outstanding, and it\u2019s going to serve our existing customer base. And so, it\u2019s going to give us this opportunity quite frankly to lower churn to get better quality service to this existing 80 million customers \u2013 phone customers we have today. That\u2019s a real benefit that I have a difficult time putting a price tag on or giving predictions for. But I know it\u2019s a real benefit for us and for the shareholders, for the customers. So, we feel really good about that. And that leaves us just in a very smooth transition into 5G. This 5G Evolution is going on now to 5G Plus with our millimeter wave and our 20 markets that we\u2019re in today. And with the 5G in the core network, where we\u2019ll have nationwide coverage next year, we expect by the middle of the year. So, we really are leading in 5G. We really are \u2013 and FirstNet is enabling this, and it\u2019s going to have a lot of benefits to it. So, you can understand why we do feel good. We do feel good about what the team is doing and how they\u2019re performing, and optimistic about meeting targets going forward. Last thing I\u2019ll say is the accounting side of it, you get 70% of this complete by the end of this year. And our network guys have surprised me on the positive side before. We\u2019re going to have a lot of the CapEx behind us on the build side. And the remaining piece would be software upgrades, so we feel really good about the financial aspects of this process also. Randall Stephenson : Thank, Brett. We\u2019ll take the next question. Operator : Will come from the line of Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Michael McCormack : Hey, guys, thanks. Randall, obviously a lot of news out there and it seems like the last game was about to change, I guess, fairly dramatically in the wireless business. Just sort of thinking, what are your thoughts over the next three to four years as you see potentially new entrants coming in? How does that change the AT&T strategy going forward? And I guess, secondly on the Business Wireline side, just to circle back on that, it feels like \u2013 it sounds like you guys are going to much more on retention efforts around that. Is there something there with regard to share loss being stemmed that\u2019s also having a positive impact? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : I\u2019m sorry, Mike. That last question, say it again, Business Wireline on retention\u2026 Michael McCormack : Just on the Business Wireline side, it seems I\u2019ve been hearing that you guys been doing a much better job in retaining customers and probably shared to competitors. I just want to see if there\u2019s any commentary on that? Randall Stephenson : That\u2019s \u2013 and it happens to be accurate. We have done a very good job as new big deals come up retaining those, and as I\u2019ve told you the pricing has been fairly rational in the marketplace. And so, yeah, we really have had not only on a retention basis, but also on an acquisition basis, picking up new logos. We\u2019ve picked up a number of new logos in the last year or so. And so that business, again, I just won\u2019t dwell on it, but it continues to surprise us in terms of how it\u2019s doing. And I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s all 100% great execution, but all of that was just good economic health. And American business is quite healthy right now. In terms of industry structure, there\u2019s a lot of noise out there right now in industry structure. And the news this morning that maybe T-Mobile is close to having a deal with the DOJ. I just \u2013 there\u2019s a \u2013 there are so many ifs around industry structure and who\u2019s going to be in the market, and who\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually hard to respond to it. But to answer your question directly, if Charlie Ergen has wireless assets and distribution or Sprint T-Mobile happens or doesn\u2019t happen, candidly, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re going to do for the next three years. Our strategy is pretty well baked, and I think the strategy is resilient as it relates to changes in industry structure. It\u2019s a strategy from a wireless standpoint that is, first and foremost, centered around FirstNet, getting the FirstNet capability deployed, built, standing up new distribution, tapping that new market and just continuing to drive network quality. And then, obviously, the 5G deployment is high, high priority. Also, then pairing that with a unique content in HBO Max. It\u2019s not even here yet, but HBO Max will be a key part of this wireless strategy as we get into next year and pairing a very unique premium video content with our wireless and our TV and broadband business. So, whether anything happens with that or not, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy. Now the status of these deals, it\u2019s obviously one that we\u2019re watching very closely, but there are so many ifs around, does the industry structure change or not. And the interesting part is it\u2019s set up where the DOJ is probably not going to be the last say on this deal. And I\u2019ve not seen this happen in M&A before, where the state AGs have positioned themselves, where they will be the last say on any deal that gets done and they\u2019re kind of in a position where they\u2019re going to be grading the DOJ\u2019s work as we go through this. And so, thinking about state AGs and then the rumors and so forth in the marketplace, what level of comfort they\u2019ll take that the antitrust concerns and fix is Charlie Ergen coming into the wireless business, that\u2019s been decades in the making, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they react to that. So, a lot of things up in the air. It\u2019s hard to say which way this thing goes, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re doing. Operator : Next up, we have the line of Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : As you consider balancing revenue performance and profitability, can you discuss the role that content exclusivities will play in the future for AT&T in 2 respects? First, on the content in sports rights, like NFL SUNDAY TICKET that you distribute through DIRECTV, and then second, separately, how you think about monetizing the content library in WarnerMedia on an exclusive basis, whether it\u2019s through HBO Max or other distributors like Netflix? Randall Stephenson : Sure. Hi, Mike. Yes. So, start with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET exclusivity. That\u2019s something that served DIRECTV well for many years. However, unfortunately, right now, that content is tied to our satellite product. And so, it serves a good value as we come into the fall. It\u2019ll be an important retention tool. But in terms of an opportunity to grow our business with that, when it\u2019s anchored to a satellite product, it\u2019s kind of hard to utilize it. So hopefully, over time, we can address that and move it on to our other platforms. And I think it can be a really important piece of growing our other platforms. As you think about NBA, Major League Baseball, a lot of the content that \u2013 is \u2013 content rights that are held by the Turner companies, whether it be TNT or TBS and the NBA Final 4, and then playoffs fit that as well, those are obviously really important variables. And they\u2019ve been very, very important in making Turner very unique content as we market it to other distributors, but also as we begin to put that content on our HBO Max platform. This will be at the early stages of HBO Max, but you should assume that ultimately, HBO Max will have live elements. And those live elements, both unique live sports, premium sports, the ones we just went through, NBA, Major League Baseball, NCAA basketball, those are going to be really, really important elements for HBO Max. The same with news, and you can go through the areas of news that we think are very, very important, and will do quite well as an element of HBO Max. So exclusive content has been important for as long as the TV business has been around. We don\u2019t see that changing, and you should assume that we will take advantage of opportunities, both within Turner and don\u2019t forget Bleacher Report. We have some great exclusive live content in Bleacher Report, from NBA to soccer, European soccer and so forth. So, a lot of opportunities to take advantage of the unique content deals that we have within WarnerMedia. Operator : Next up, we have the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : If I may on the Entertainment Business, if you just look at the performance this particular quarter, despite losing subs, you, of course, did well on revenues and EBITDA relative to expectation then. So, I guess, it\u2019s getting to a point where the yield is better than the sub-losses overall. And therefore, when you look at some of these new product launches, the central line device going forward and even DIRECTV NOW, how are you thinking about \u2013 what\u2019s the product vision behind it? Is it more to manage that? Or is it more for growth? And is video growth from a subscriber perspective really important going forward? Or should we just assume that because the focus is margins and growth, margins and top line stability, the focus will more be on price and costs? Randall Stephenson : Yes. Hi, Kannan. This is Randall again. You\u2019ve nailed the equation. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what the equation is. It\u2019s \u2013 one has to ask, how is it that subscribers can decline like this and margins expand? And it says a lot about the customers that are staying on the network, that they tend to be very high-value customers, tend to be very valuable customers as you think about where we are going as a company. And that is distributing unique content through as many distribution points as possible. And so, as you think about the product portfolio going forward, which is what you have teed up, it\u2019s interesting. The DIRECTV product is going to have a really long life, and they\u2019re going to be segments of the market for a long time, but that\u2019s how you\u2019ll address those segments of the market. This thin client product that were bringing to market, it literally takes the customer acquisition costs and cuts it in half. And the beauty of that is that you can begin to address a fundamental problem with the current linear TV business, and that is the price point, but the content costs just continuing to grow. You heard me talk about Nexstar wanting 100% increase on their broadcast rights and so forth. We\u2019ve got to find a way to get the cost curve down on this product, so we can keep people into the product for a longer-term basis. So, as you drive customer acquisition costs in half on AT&T TV, the new product we\u2019re bringing to market, then you can bring the price points down and hold margins and still have the same value equation from a customer standpoint. So, DIRECTV, good product, will be there for a long time. AT&T TV, you should assume, this will be the workhorse over the next couple of years. And we will put our shoulder and our muscle behind AT&T TV, get a lower price point, shore up this customer base over the next couple of years. And then the part that shouldn\u2019t be missed, and we haven\u2019t given any subscriber numbers on HBO digital because we just had Game of Thrones, and we added a lot of digital subscribers. And we will, as we get to the WarnerMedia Day, we\u2019ll give some visibility into those. But until we kind of know what the churn characteristics of a product like this looks like, we\u2019re going to be a little guarded about giving subscribers. But here\u2019s what we do know, and that is HBO \u2013 DISH stopped carrying HBO. And year-over-year, we\u2019re actually up HBO subscribers. That tells you how strong the digital subscriber performance of this thing was. And churn is hanging in there pretty strong in the third quarter because as Game of Thrones went off, the HBO folks, we gave them more capital to invest in content. So, in comes the new season of Big Little Lies. It\u2019s performed very well. Chernobyl was a blowout success. After Big Little Lies ended last Sunday. Now we have Succession coming online. The new season of Barry is coming into play, and this thing is just feeling pretty good. And so, as you think about a video portfolio, DIRECTV, AT&T TV, HBO, which we\u2019re getting more and more conviction that HBO Max is going to be meaningful, you can imagine that those are the places we\u2019re going to put our shoulder and our muscle as we move forward. And the implications of that to profitability, we think, are pretty important. And so, we\u2019ll give more visibility on the WarnerMedia Day in October. But bottom line, we like how the video portfolio is shaping up here, and you can listen to that discussion and begin to appreciate where you would expect our marketing and customer acquisition muscle to go. John Stephens : Randall, if I could, one thing to add. All that investment that Randall was talking about and all these new shows that\u2019s showing up, first of all, you\u2019ve seen the 3% revenue increase at HBO ties exactly to what Randall said. How are you doing that without strong digital performance? It\u2019s like all these new shows that he\u2019s talking about, we\u2019ve made those content investments. We continue to invest in content just like CapEx throughout the year. And that is in \u2013 that is already included in those free cash flow numbers that we\u2019ve shown up through this year and included in our guidance. So, we are making decisions to continue to invest. We\u2019re doing that today. You\u2019re seeing the build on 5G today. You\u2019re seeing this investment in content today. And with all of that, we\u2019re still coming back to this kind of $4 a share of free cash flow, not only for the trailing 12 months, but for this year. So, I\u2019d say this, we are investing in the business, particularly in the comments around I made on WarnerMedia and HBO and those types, but also across the board. It\u2019s just really important to keep that in mind, and we\u2019re still generating just tremendous cash flows, not only in total, but on a per-share basis. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan : Randall, can you dive into the 5G strategy a little bit more? It does feel like now you could be a few years ahead of your peers, and it seems like a great opportunity to gain share, maybe grow ARPUs here, but are you going to be able to deploy the 5G software as soon as the FirstNet build has gone by the end of next year? And can you talk about maybe what the go-to-market strategy will look like? Will you look to gain share more so or will it be to grow ARPUs? And just practically speaking, from a customer perspective, how much more speed or network capacity or latency will they really see off the bat and starting in 2021? Randall Stephenson : Yes. Hi, Tim. You bet. We are pretty consistent in talking about the advantages of FirstNet, and that it\u2019s allowing us to deploy this 5G hardware with one touch on the sales side. So, we climbed the sales side, and we\u2019re doing a number of things. We\u2019re turning up the FirstNet hardware and the FirstNet spectrum, and then we\u2019re turning up all this other latent data spectrum that we own as we climb the tower and putting the 5G hardware in place. And we\u2019ve put the beta alpha tag on the phone for 5G Evolution. And I know some of our competitors didn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s proving to be exactly what we told the market that it would be. You turn up all the spectrum, you put the new technology in place and there is a speed enhancement. And we are unquestionably the fastest network in the market just because of that capacity served. And we are literarily in the process of, by end of 2019, we\u2019ll have increased the total capacity of this network, John had a slide on this, by 50%. There are just inherent performance improvements from that alone that we\u2019re seeing and our customers are experiencing, and our churn is reflecting this. Now 5G, to your question, will a software be ready? By mid-year next year, as we\u2019ve turned all \u2013 put all this hardware in place, we will have a nationwide footprint of 5G. So yes, the software will be turned up. And by mid-year, we\u2019ll have a nationwide footprint of 5G. We are also in the process of market-by-market turning up our millimeter wave spectrum 5G into that spectrum band. And as you know, when you put 5G into that millimeter wave band, that\u2019s when you get these radical speed lifts, and that\u2019s when you start to get the gig-type speeds. And we have it up in areas here in Dallas, for example. And I have a Samsung phone that I carry around. And I routinely, when I do speed tests here in Dallas, get over 1 gig speeds, get 2 gig on some occasions. And so, you\u2019re going to have some radical step-up in speed performance as we deploy this in the millimeter wave on top of our lower-ban spectrum where we turn it up over the course of next year. The really high-performance millimeter wave spectrum is going to come market-by-market, and it will take a while to deploy the really high-speed spectrum. As we turn it up, Tim, you should expect our focus will be a little different to some of our competitors. It is a business-driven focus at the go-down. And we think it\u2019s really important because we can deploy this technology. If somebody needs a connected factory or connected plant, we\u2019re doing this in Austin now, you will see us do that. If somebody needs a Wi-Fi replacement for their business operations, we can deploy and we can replace that. If somebody has IoT applications, we can begin to deploy this and roll these services out kind of commensurate with the network deployment. And so, it will be business-driven at first. As we get broad coverage of the millimeter wave, and this is really important, as our customers begin to get handsets into their hands that can use this technology, which right now, is pretty limited number of handsets, but as we exit next year there\u2019ll be a significant \u2013 they\u2019ll be in the dozen more handsets where people can use this technology, then you\u2019ll see us ratchet it up, the marketing and the promotion. We don\u2019t want to get too aggressive with the consumer right now where there aren\u2019t handsets in the marketplace and there isn\u2019t significant coverage. That will happen as we go through the course of next year. And we do agree with you that we have an advantage here. We have a deployment advantage, and we think we\u2019ll have nationwide, this broad 5G deployment mid-year, and that\u2019s going to be important for our customers. John Stephens : And let me wrap up, and then hand it over for Randall for some closing comments. But specifically, on the quarter, we had solid revenue growth. And we met our service revenue growth in mobility. Quality EBITDA growth, solid EPS, strong free cash flows and continued investment in both content and network that are showing up in our results. So, we feel like it was a very good quarter, and we are very \u2013 and we remain optimistic going forward. Our ability to generate cash and manage our balance sheet is without question, and we feel very good about it. Randall, let me turn it over to you. Randall Stephenson : I don\u2019t have much to add. I would we just point, all of the commitments we gave to you last year, at the end of the year, we are hitting every one of those. And we\u2019re checking the box on each of them. I am gaining greater and greater confidence we\u2019ll hit each of those as we go through the course of this year. The debt we\u2019ll have at a very reasonable place as we exit this year, I\u2019ll be \u2013 I fully expect that we\u2019ll be buying some stock back as we go through this year and the cash flows continue to produce. And look, I hope you\u2019re seeing in WarnerMedia why we thought this asset was so important for us to own. This is a great business, great talent, great people running it. HBO is firing on all cylinders. Warner Bros. is doing terrific. And all this is coming together to give us great confidence that HBO Max is going to be something special in the marketplace. And we\u2019ll get more to that, more of that to you in October. We look forward to seeing everybody there. Thank you for joining the call, and look forward to seeing you. Michael Viola : Okay. So long, everyone. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen still connected, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for all of your participation and for using our conferencing system with Event Management. At this time, you may now disconnect.",

Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As I reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with our 2019 progress and our third quarter results, but we want to spend most of our time today on the 3 year guidance and capital allocation plans that we announced this morning, then we'll take your questions. Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC's Spectrum Auction 103, so we can't answer any questions about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes the news release, investor briefing, 8-K, et cetera. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On Slide 3, you'll see some of this listed. Last November, we laid out our 2019 commitments and we challenged the team to deliver, and they have. The punchline for the quarter is that we remain on target to meet every single objective for the year. We said leverage would be around 2.5 times by year-end, and we're on track to hit that target. We told you that full year EPS would grow in the low single digits, and we're checking that box. We said we'd generate $26 billion of free cash flow, and now we're tracking to $28 billion. We said we would remain very active on the portfolio front, evaluating and executing opportunities to monetize $6 billion to $8 billion in non-core assets, and we have. Our current forecast is to realize $14 billion by year-end. We said that our wireless business would return to top line growth, and it has. Year-to-date, wireless service revenues are up nearly 2%. We committed to stabilizing Entertainment Group EBITDA despite the DIRECTV top line pressures, and through 3 quarters, Entertainment Group EBITDA is growing. And we needed to do all of this while integrating WarnerMedia, hitting our synergy targets and introducing several new services. So across the board, we're positioned to meet or exceed every commitment for the year. In a few minutes, I'll cover our 3 year plan, and you'll begin to understand why I feel good about meeting those commitments as well. But before we get into that, let me turn it over to John, and he'll go deeper into the quarter. So John? John Stephens : Thanks, Randall. When looking at our third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.94, up more than 4% and up slightly for the year. As Randall mentioned, we're on track to reach our expected low single-digit growth for the full year. Revenues were down in the quarter due in part to tough year-over-year comparables at Warner Bros., along with video and FX impacts. However, adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points with gains in Mobility, entertainment and WarnerMedia. Our cash flows are on a record pace for the year. Cash from operations came in at $11.4 billion, and free cash flow was $6.2 billion in the quarter and nearly $21 billion year-to-date. This puts us firmly on track to reach our full year target of free cash flow in the $28 billion range, both from an ongoing operations and including about $2 billion from a full year of applying our working capital approach to WarnerMedia's assets. This solid free cash flow comes even with strong capital investment. CapEx was $5.2 billion, and total capital investment was $6 billion when you include the $800 million of payments for prior vendor financing activity. As Randall said, with asset sales as well as expected free cash flow in the fourth quarter, we expect to hit our 2.5 times range net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA target by the end of the year. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 6. Starting with Mobility. We're growing service revenues and adding phone subscribers while increasing EBITDA. Wireless service revenues grew by about 1% in the quarter and approximately 2% year-to-date, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter. EBITDA grew by 1.6% to $7.8 billion, and EBITDA margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 55.7%. During the quarter, we had 255,000 phone net adds, including more than 100,000 postpaid and 154,000 prepaid voice. We also continue to stack up industry awards, including being named the nation's best wireless network for the second year in a row and fastest for the third consecutive quarter. These awards say it best : Our network investment and spectrum deployment are paying off. Let's now look at our Entertainment Group. One of our key priorities for 2019 was to stabilize Entertainment Group's EBITDA. Year-to-date, we're up 2.3% with expense reductions outpacing video and legacy revenue losses. premium video and IP broadband ARPUs continue to grow. Our 300,000-plus AT&T Fiber net adds helped drive broadband revenue growth. We also expect that our premium video losses have peaked. We had about 225,000 net losses due to programming blackouts. Our gross adds were down about 400,000 due to new, higher intro pricing and credit thresholds, as well as more targeted promotions, and we continue to work through customers rolling off 2 year price locks. Those video losses also impacted our broadband numbers, especially our bundled customers, but we did have more than 300,000 AT&T Fiber net adds in the quarter. And Business Wireline revenue trends improved year-over-year, thanks to strength in strategic and managed services. That performance came even with about $80 million less of intellectual property revenue when compared to the year ago quarter. With our strong business wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenues grew by about 1%. Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results which are on Slide 7. WarnerMedia revenues largely reflect a comparison to a very strong revenue third quarter last year, which includes strong television licensing revenue growth and a box office slate that includes several hits. But WarnerMedia operating margins expanded in the quarter. Even with lower revenues, Warners Bros. operating income was up 2% due to lower film and TV production costs. We also will have challenging comparisons to the fourth quarter. We're off to a strong start with the box office success of Joker. But remember, the fourth quarter of last year included blockbuster movies such as Aquaman, Fantastic Beasts 2 and A Star is Born. Turner revenues were up on subscription revenue growth, partly offset by lower advertising and content licensing and other revenues, but operating income was up almost 3%. HBO revenues and operating income saw double-digit growth, thanks to strong content sales driven by international licensing. HBO's third quarter is even more impressive when you consider the DISH carriage dispute and Game of Thrones finale both occurred in the second quarter. WarnerMedia also delivered another incredible performance at this year's Emmy Awards, leading the industry with 39 primetime Emmys and 15 news and documentary Emmys. Our Latin America team continues to do an excellent job of reducing costs in a challenging foreign exchange environment that helped drive an EBITDA increase of more than 20%. A large part of the increase was due to an $81 million improvement in Mexico EBITDA. We expect this trend to continue and Mexico EBITDA to be positive in the fourth quarter, and we also added nearly 600,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter. Those are our third quarter highlights. I'll now hand it back to Randall to talk about our 3 year financial outlook and capital allocation plan that we announced this morning. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, John. So what I want to do is talk to you about what you should expect over the next 3 years. Before we get into the numbers, I want to begin with a broader discussion on our strategy. If you go to Slide 9, we'll outline this for you. Since 2012, we've made a series of strategic investments, and those investments have been aligned around 2 overarching trends. First, consumers will continue to spend more time viewing premium content; and second, businesses and consumers will continue to demand more connectivity, more bandwidth and more mobility. When we began pursuing this strategy, we saw an emerging world in which consumption of video and other premium content was no longer bound to your living room. And everything we expected has arrived, and it has arrived sooner than we or anyone else anticipated. And now the foundational elements of our investment thesis are clearer than ever. It all starts with advanced high-capacity networks. From our iPhone experience, we knew the mobile Internet revolution in a world of streaming video would require much more capacity than people were anticipating, so we began investing for future demand. First, we spent $20 billion on premium spectrum licenses. Next, we acquired Leap Wireless, which gave us additional spectrum; and Cricket's prepaid business. We've doubled the size of that business and transformed it from losing money to healthy margins. And finally, we were selected to build and manage the First Responder Network for the United States government, and this brought with it another layer of premium spectrum capacity. Over the last 18 months, we've been putting all this capacity into service, and the performance results have been dramatic. AT&T now has the fastest and most reliable wireless network in the U.S. We've invested to extend these same capabilities south into Mexico. In 4 years, we built a high-speed nationwide network and have doubled the customer base. We've also been undertaking the most aggressive fiber deployment program in the U.S. since 2015 with over 20 million locations passed. Over the next 3 years, our strong spectrum position will allow for lower capital intensity, and that bodes well for growing operating margins. The second essential element is direct customer relationships, and we have about 170 million of them across mobile, pay TV and broadband. And that number reaches 370 million when you include our digital properties such as cnn.com, Bleacher Report and Otter Media. As we prepare to launch HBO Max, our direct customer relationships are an asset that any streaming company would love to have. Gaining scale in linear pay TV was the core rationale behind our DIRECTV acquisition. We realized the satellite business was mature and we anticipated subscriber losses. However, the content savings quickly turned our U-verse pay TV business from loss to a profit. And since we bought DIRECTV, it has generated healthy cash flows of over $4 billion per year or a total of $22 billion in cash by the end of this year. Third, we were convinced that the value of premium content would increase significantly over time as consumer demand continued to grow and new forms of distribution emerged. And I think you've already seen that with some of the multiples paid for media companies after we did our deal. Vertically integrating content and distribution is the future, and we're seeing it across the board. And last, the vast distribution network and subscriber base brings unique viewer and customer insights. Pairing these with our large advertising inventories at DIRECTV and Turner and creating an ad tech platform is a unique opportunity, and every work -- every move we've made has been focused on building these four critical capabilities. So now as we conclude 2019, we are the clear leader in network performance and capacity. We have one of the premier entertainment companies in the world with a broad-based presence in premium content and direct customer relationships, and I wouldn't trade places with anyone. So if you turn to Slide 10, I want to take a look at our 3 year outlook. Looking ahead, let me take you through the keys to our financial outlook, to our capital allocation plan. And all this will drive compelling returns for our shareholders. I'm going to start with the top line. We expect total company revenues over the 3-year period to grow by 1% to 2% per year. This will be driven by strength in Mobility, increased fiber penetration and WarnerMedia. As mentioned earlier, our wireless business is now enjoying operating leverage from investments made over the last 5 years. Our WarnerMedia cost synergies are on target and EBITDA at AT&T Mexico is ramping, and we're identifying significant opportunities for margin improvement through ongoing cost evaluation and operational review. Given our incremental investments in HBO Max in 2020 and our expectations for strong growth in equipment revenue driven by the 5G upgrade cycle, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be stable in 2020. From there, we will drive 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion by 2022, above the 2019 levels. Improving margins 200 basis points will give us an EBITDA margin of 35% in 2022. And applying a 35% margin to a revenue base that's growing 1% to 2% per year produces an EBITDA lift in the neighborhood of $6 billion in 2022, and that includes our investment in HBO Max. The drivers for this EBITDA margin expansion are : WarnerMedia cost synergies, continued improvements in our wireless business, continued EBITDA growth at AT&T Mexico and our plan to take out costs across the entire company. In fact, we've hired Bill Morrow. He's a Special Adviser and Managing Director of Process Service and Cost Optimization, and he's leading our enterprise-wide cost-reduction initiative. Bill has been CEO of large communication companies in the U.S., Europe and Australia, and he has a proven track record of creating best-in-class cost structures. He'll have full authority to examine and change our cost structure across the entire company to ensure that we achieve the targets that we're outlining today. Bill's work will be overseen by the Board's Corporate Development and Finance Committee and myself. And it will be above and beyond what we're already doing with network virtualization, real estate consolidation and our other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. Our free cash flow has grown significantly over the past few years, and that's thanks in part to our DIRECTV and Time Warner deals being cash flow-accretive on day 1. We expect free cash flow to be at $28 billion in 2020. And as the HBO Max investment declines and we execute against our cost take-out initiatives, free cash flow will grow by more than $1 billion in 2021 and another $1 billion in 2022, reaching $30 billion to $32 billion in 2022. Now let me talk about our 3 year capital allocation framework. We'll continue to grow the dividend as we have since I joined the company. Expect modest annual increases and a dividend payout ratio going below 50% in 2022. After paying the dividend, we expect to use 50% to 70% of our free cash flow to retire about 70% of the shares we issued for the Time Warner deal. And we will continue to reduce debt going forward. Our target is that by 2022, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio will be between 2 and 2.25 quarter times, and we'll have retired 100% of the debt we took on for Time Warner. This is a very comfortable leverage ratio for us. We have routinely pruned the portfolio of assets that don't contribute to our core strategy. In fact, when you conclude what we've done in 2019, we've monetized more than $30 billion in non-strategic assets over the last few years. You should expect continued evaluation of our businesses and more progress on divesting assets that are no longer core to our fundamental mission. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to realize about $14 billion in non-core asset monetizations this year, and we're targeting $5 billion to $10 billion next year. This is a continuous process for us. It is one of the areas in which our Corporate Development and Finance Committee dedicates a tremendous amount of time and attention. With the support of our Board generally and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee in particular, I've instructed our executive team to begin the next review of our portfolio. So we're going to give you regular updates on our progress as we've done over the last year. We're committed to an objective, diligent and disciplined process. We'll analyze the merits of each of our businesses individually and as a part of the whole. But let me be clear, we have no sacred cows. We're always open to making portfolio moves, and DIRECTV has been the source of a lot of public speculation in that regard. As we've said, it will be an important piece of our strategy over the next 3 years. But no portion of our business is ever exempt from a continuous assessment for fit and performance. We'll approach it with a fresh set of eyes and clarity around the rapidly evolving consumer environment, and we'll evaluate multiple options. That includes partnerships and other structures. Likewise, given the quality of our assets, there will be no major acquisitions during the next several years. With our financial outlook and the benefits of our capital allocation policy, we expect EPS growth in 2020 will be up low single digits. But by 2022, we expect EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80. That includes our investment in HBO Max of between $0.15 and $0.20 per share in 2020 and then $0.10 per share in 2021 and 2022. And as you can see, over the next 3 years, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all grow every single year. Free cash flow is stable in 2020 and then grows in 2021 and 2022. This plan will deliver both substantial and consistent financial improvements for the next 3 years. And before I hand it to John for his perspective on the 3-year plan, I want to say a few words about what you'll see tomorrow at Warner Bros. Studios and our investment in the HBO Max platform. This is a terrific product, and I honestly can't wait for you to see it. John Stankey and his WarnerMedia team will take you through all aspects of the strategy, the product and the rollout, including our revenue and subscriber expectations for the next 5 years. We'll be investing to maximize the value of the service, which will drive growth and value to WarnerMedia and to AT&T as a whole. HBO Max is a terrific platform, and we're aligned in making it great while also being responsible with our capital and value. We'll make the significant investments required to win in the marketplace, but we'll also hit our numbers and ensure that we deliver on the promises that we're outlining for you here today. I feel really good about this plan, and I'm highly confident in hitting each of our 3-year objectives. So now I'll ask John to provide his perspective on our 3-year plan. So John? John Stephens : Thanks, Randall. Let's turn to Slide 12 and dive a little deeper on some of the details of the 3-year plan. We're expecting 1% to 2% revenue CAGR for the next 3 years. On the operational side, we expect wireless service revenues to grow by more than 2% per year. FirstNet, our network quality improvement and reseller initiatives, all offer growth opportunities for us. We also expect 5G device adoption to boost equipment sales as we launch our nationwide 5G network in 2020. We also expect to continue our broadband revenue growth to help offset legacy and video pressures. And we expect to see significant incremental growth during the planning period from HBO Max and targeted advertising from Xandr. Randall did a good job of laying out our EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth plans. Our incremental cost plan will contribute to the 200 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement. One way we plan to do that is through product simplification. Our future video product set will focus on 2 platforms : HBO Max, our subscription video on-demand service, which you'll hear more about tomorrow; and AT&T TV, our live TV offering. Turning to capital allocation plans. We expect to return about $75 billion in value to shareholders over the next 3 years through $30 billion of share retirements and $45 billion in dividends. Our share retirement will be aggressive. We expect to retire about 70% of the shares issued for the Time Warner deal. That's more than 10% of the company. You heard our debt reduction target earlier, but let me repeat it here : We intend to target leverage between 2.0 times and 2.25 times. As CFO, I'm very comfortable operating the business in that range. Randall also mentioned that we overachieved on asset monetizations this year, and we'll monetize more non-core assets next year as we continue to analyze the merits of all of our businesses. That's our 3-year outlook, but let's look at our 2020 guidance on Slide 13. Let me start by laying out that all these financial projections take into consideration the impact of our investment in HBO Max. We expect revenue to be up low single digits driven by growth from wireless service revenues and strong equipment revenues from the launch of 5G smartphones. This revenue growth represents our best top line performance in several years and highlights the strong performance across our businesses. We expect the base business will generate EPS of $3.75 to $3.90 per share. When you subtract the $0.15 to $0.20 per share of HBO Max investment, we expect adjusted EPS growth in the $3.60 to $3.70 per share range. Our share retirement program will be a big part of this growth. We also expect consolidated EBITDA margin to be stable with 2019 levels, even with the impact from our HBO Max investment and 5G smartphones being available next year. Helping us keep EBITDA margins stable will be wireless service revenue growth, WarnerMedia synergies and our cost initiatives. Free cash flow is expected to be in the $28 billion range. It's about the same as this year even with the HBO Max investment. And our dividend payout ratio will be in the 50% range. We'll continue to invest at leadership levels in 2020 with an expected gross capital investment in the $20 billion range. And we'll continue to monetize our asset portfolio. We expect $5 billion to $10 billion of asset monetizations in 2020. Let's next walk through the components of our 3-year EPS growth plan on Slide 14. As you can see from the chart, our path to $4.50 to $4.80 a share is clear and achievable. A large part of that expected growth is a result of share retirements. That alone should get us about $0.40 a share. Our enterprise-wide cost-reduction plans and Mexico profitability growth should net us another $0.25. Our remaining WarnerMedia synergies adds another $0.20. We also include about $0.10 of HBO Max investment in 2022. That business should turn profitable after that. The growth plans that we've just outlined for you provide real earnings opportunities. When you combine our dividend yield along with share retirements of more than 3% a year for the next 3 years, that provides a yield of about 8.5% per year. And when you factor in EPS growth, you get a solid double-digit return. I want to reiterate what Randall said earlier. We have a high degree of confidence in delivering on these commitments. We're hitting our marks in 2019 and feel very strongly that we will do it again with this 3-year plan. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Okay. Thanks, John. And before we get to Q&A, I want to speak to just a couple of additional issues. And if you go to Slide 15, we've listed these. Over the last few years, we have continuously refreshed our Board of Directors. It's been done under the leadership of Matt Rose. He's our Independent Lead Director, Chair of our Nominating Committee. Today, the average tenure of our independent directors is 8 years. And of our 12 independent directors, 10 have joined the Board since 2012. This is the Board that has directed our transformation into a modern media company. And along the way, we've added new directors with the skills and experience to inform and guide our business strategies. That includes 3 directors since 2015 with particularly strong backgrounds in large-scale video distribution, media and entertainment and digital media. Looking ahead, we have 2 directors retiring in the next 18 months. As a result, we have a natural opportunity to continue our Board refreshment and add additional skill sets that align tightly with the objectives I outlined this morning. In fact, we've been in discussion with some exciting candidates for some time. And in the coming days, following our next regularly scheduled Board meeting, we anticipate adding a new Board member with deep expertise in technology and executing strategic cost initiatives. This new director will be added to the Corporate Development and Finance Committee, which has responsibility for overseeing our cost program and the evaluation of our portfolio. And we'll then add another director in 2020. And finally, there's been a lot of speculation recently concerning my retirement. The Board and I have not yet set any formal plans for my retirement as CEO, but having been in the role for over 11 years, you can rest assured the Board and I have begun detailed planning for when that date arrives. We've spent many years guiding the business to the strong position we have today, and for all the reasons I've described, I believe we're on the threshold of something really remarkable in terms of the next chapter of AT&T's storied history. I have every intention of being here, and I will be here through 2020 to ensure that we hit the objectives we've laid out today : to drive significant growth in EBITDA margins and EPS and to invest in growth areas and to retire all the debt and most of the shares issued in the Time Warner merger. My goal and my strong belief is that this is going to drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. And helping me do this will be my talented colleague, John Stankey, who was recently appointed COO. He has a big job, and his teams are working together to develop their joint plans, and John is continuing to build his leadership teams across all 3 businesses. The Board and I have very high expectations for John. I'm excited for him, and I look forward to seeing him tackle his new responsibilities. Together, we're all about execution and delivering on our 3-year plan. You should also understand that the Board views leadership and CEO succession as one of its most important responsibilities to shareholders. The Board's HR Committee, which is led by Chair, Beth Mooney, oversees our talent management program and our succession planning process. Under the HR Committee's leadership, the Board's evaluation of all potential candidates for the CEO position has been underway for some time, and it continues today. Further, whenever my transition as CEO does occur, the Board has already determined that it will separate the Chairman and the CEO positions. This is an exciting time at AT&T for all of our shareholders, our customers, our partners, employees and investors. The Board and our entire management team and I place the highest priority on generating value for our shareholders. Following 5-plus years of heavy investment, it's now time to reap the rewards of these investments to deliver some strong returns. We believe that the plan we've taken you through today is going to deliver strong performance across all measures and that it should generate significant value creation in the near and the long term. The strategic transformation we've been working on for several years has enabled this new plan, and we've assembled the best set of capabilities to excel as a modern media company. The objectives we have outlined today had been central to our plans for many months, even before we closed our acquisition of Time Warner. But as you would expect, our thinking has also benefited from robust engagement with our owners, and that includes Elliott Management. And given the shareholder interest in our engagement with the team at Elliott, I'm happy to address that subject very directly here. Over the past several weeks, Matt Rose and I have found our engagement with Elliott to be both constructive as well as helpful. Among other things, Elliott has met with the prospective new director that I mentioned earlier and is enthusiastic about that addition to our Board following our next meeting. These are smart people, and they very much understand the tremendous opportunity we have to create substantial shareholder value. As we move forward in the coming months, the Board and I look forward to continuing our close collaboration with Elliott on strategy, operational initiatives in our portfolio and to see through the value-enhancing steps that I've laid out today. I'm excited about our strategy, and I'm very excited about this plan. And I want you to know that I'm all in on running this play and seeing us execute it. So I know you have a lot of questions, and so we're going to open it up to Q&A. So Mike, I'll turn it back to you. Michael Viola : Okay. Greg, we are ready to take questions. And can you please give us those Q&A instructions? Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Congrats on the new plan. So I guess, Randall or John, as we kind of think about this more prescriptive capital allocation plan that you've kind of outlined with respect to dividends and stock buybacks, could you kind of talk about how that wraps around the potential for spectrum acquisition or kind of other opportunities? And especially that dovetails with the kind of commitment to the no-acquisition posture. In the media world in particular, it seems like this is very much becoming a scale game. It would seem that more scale would be better if this is the right strategy. Could you kind of wrap all this together for us in terms of how we kind of get the business developed in the right way while at the same time following through on these commitments for capital allocation? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Yes, Dave. This is Randall. I'm going to start, and I'll let John supplement what I say here if there's anything else he wants to add. But what we have given you today is a cash flow forecast and plan, built around operational aspects that would allow us to do the shareholder returns that you heard us talk to today, particularly around EPS accretion and such. To the extent that we need to engage in spectrum acquisitions of some type, and I have to be cautious because we're in a quiet period here. But what I can give you confidence in, and what I'd tell you we now have confidence in, we developed a lot of muscle over the last couple of years, on cleaning up the portfolio. And I am very confident that portfolio cleanup and asset dispositions will more than offset anything we need to do in terms of spectrum acquisition. So what we're committed to is this capital allocation, this capital return plan, because we've been investing very aggressively over the last 5, 6 years to get us to this point. And I just think we're in a very seminal point, Dave, point where now it's time to reap the rewards of what we've been doing. And so drive margin expansion, get the 1% to 2% revenue growth, it's going to generate incredible cash flow. CapEx comes in, in 2020 as you saw in John's numbers and so begin to reward to shareholders these investments that we've been making over the last few years. So bottom line, we're committed to what we've laid out here in terms of capital returns. When we talk about M&A, we've said no major M&A. We like the assets we have. I mean this is really, across the board, a quality, premium set of assets. If we have to do tuck-in acquisitions here and there to supplement capabilities, like you saw the HBO LAG deal that we did Friday, the LA - or pardon me, the Latin American HBO property. That's a small acquisition that's immediately accretive, and it just supplements what we're trying to do in Latin America with our HBO Max product. And so you'll see those kind of things. But in terms of big M&A, we have no needs given the assets that we have right now. John Stephens : Yes. Dave, just to put a kind of a numerical perspective. $500 billion balance sheet, finding 1% to 2% a year on a recurring basis is certainly a reasonable goal and something we have high expectations to be able to achieve. From a practical standpoint, we've announced two deals, Puerto Rico and the CME transaction was announced yesterday. They're going to provide about $3 billion in capital just next year, so we have a great head start to the deals that will close next year that will give us more cash, things that we've already gotten done. And you can rest assured we got more of that in process. And then with regard to spectrum, as Randall said, can't comment on the 39 that's underway. With regard to the C-band and the other future auctions, certainly we'll be interested. As always, we're interested in fair auctions that provide as much spectrum available to the marketplace and allows all bidders to bid. We think that's going to take some time, particularly with the C-band and the FCC. But certainly, we'd be interested. By the same token, there's a clear expectation we'll pay for it with asset monetizations on this balance sheet, that we have that opportunity to do that. David Barden : Thanks for the color guys. Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : So around video, have we hit the peak of losses in terms of near-term video trends? And how do you think about the impact of AT&T TV launching versus the price increase of AT&T TV Now recently? And it looks like you plan to invest about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in HBO Max in 2020 and about $1 billion a year for the following couple of years. How do you think about this level of investment to drive success in a market that's increasingly full of competitive offers? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Phil, this is Randall. I think John mentioned it in his comments that in terms of the video losses, particularly around the satellite product, third quarter is the peak. Third quarter is -- we had a couple of significant blackouts in terms of content, and those blackouts drove some sizable subscriber losses. And then we had the cleanup that's been going on in the customer base in terms of prior promotions and so forth. And so we have pretty much run to the end of those. There's a little bit more of the customer cleanup that will run into Q4, but in terms of the losses, they will be significantly improved in the fourth quarter and get better as we move into next year. As you think about the product portfolio going forward, and you're seeing this in terms of the pricing moves that we're making. But as we get into next year, you're basically going to see our traditional satellite platform, which is going to have a long life. I mean this business continues to be really strong, generates a lot of cash flow. As I said in my comments, there's more than $4 billion of free cash flow a year and done $22 billion since we owned the thing. But as we get into next year, then you'll have the satellite then you'll have the software platforms. And AT&T TV is the standardized software platform, and that will be our primary vehicle for going to market, particularly pairing it with our fiber product and our broadband product. And then HBO Max becomes the workhorse for our video product as we move into next year. And all of the muscle, and as you can see and as you articulated, the range of investment is going behind HBO Max. In terms of are we comfortable with that level in what you called a crowded field, I actually think the field in terms of where we intend to play is not that crowded. We intend to play at a significant level, and we're starting with a product called HBO, which has a very significant position in the marketplace. And as you're going to see tomorrow, we're investing heavily behind that brand and bringing additional content to bear. And I actually feel very comfortable. And I think tomorrow, Phil, that's all tomorrow is about, is to get you comfortable that this is a unique product. This is a product that's going to be very different from anything else that you've seen in the market so far. This is not Netflix, this is not Disney, this is HBO Max, and it's going to have a very unique position in the marketplace. And I would tell you we feel very comfortable at these investment levels, that we can do something very significant in the market and drive some significant subscriber gains. This is going to be a meaningful business to us over the next 4 or 5 years. And we're talking a 50 million subscriber business and I'm really, really enthusiastic about this. So the video product gets really streamlined and simplified as we move into next year. Satellite and then software product. And then one of the big cost initiatives, and it's not inconsequential, is John Stankey is bringing the video platforms, the software platforms, he will be standardizing all of these. And as you can well guess, AT&T TV, we have a development and cost associated with that. HBO Max, there's a technology development cost associated with that. Putting these on a standardized platform over the next couple of years drives significant savings as well. So feel pretty good about the platform, and the numbers should improve as we move forward. Philip Cusick : Randall, just to be clear, the 50 million you mentioned, is that current or forecast? Randall Stephenson : Forecast. That's what we're forecasting, domestic HBO Max over 5 years. Philip Cusick : Thanks very much. Randall Stephenson : Greg, we\u2019ll take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great, thanks, Maybe two questions. One for John and one for Randall. John, could you give some more detail on the - I guess both the near term and the sort of the longer term 200 basis points of margin improvement? I guess Randall just mentioned that some of it comes from product simplification within the entertainment segment. But can you talk a little bit about how you expect some of those cost initiatives to impact each of the segments? Should we expect continued improvement in wireless margins and in enterprise and WarnerMedia? And then for Randall, I guess with today's announcements, the company has addressed, I'd say, the majority of the issues laid out in the Elliott letter. What I didn't see though is with John Stankey taking on the role of COO, what's the time frame for him to relinquish leadership of the WarnerMedia asset? Thanks. John Stephens : Thanks, John. Let me take the first question on the 200 basis point improvement in margins. Let me give a base case that we see -- now we are expecting improvement from Mobility. We are expecting improvement from Mexico. We are expecting improvement from the WarnerMedia cost synergies. With that being said, these additional cost synergies that we're talking about, I would categorize in just a couple or 3 buckets. One, I think you'll see product simplification. I think we'll see a big effort with Bill and the team working with John and everyone across the enterprise on product simplification. I think that should provide significant rewards. Secondly, I would tell you that there's still general administrative expense savings, and I think that opportunity continues to be there. You've got to remember that we've only got final court clearance on the Time Warner deal just 6 months ago, so we've got more opportunities in bringing that together. Third, the video platforms, Randall mentioned this, and the standardization of those platforms, bringing those platform cost and development and capabilities together not only is a great business result but also an opportunity. I think those are kind of 3 things I'd point to kind of real quickly and real briefly. We'll look at everything there are. Just like with the portfolio there's no sacred cows.  But to give you a just a more simple sense of it, about $180 billion of revenue, about $120 billion of COE gets us our $60 billion of EBITDA. If we can mine out 1% to 2% of our COE every year, that's in that $1.5 billion to $2 billion range. I'm not setting a target for ourselves, but you can give us a sense that, that really gives us some comfort with regard to that overall $6 billion EBITDA improvement, especially when you've got great progress in things like Mexico, great progress in Mobility, real improvements across the enterprise. Randall Stephenson : I would actually just append a little bit into that. We're going to now have Bill Morrow and John Stankey heading up an initiative to take these costs out, that John just gave you the big blocks of what they will go after. These are two process improvement hawks. They are probably as good as it gets anywhere in terms of streamlining process, simplifying process and taking cost out. And as you look at this plan of the areas that I have the least concern that we will achieve, setting objectives to get cost out, to get 200 basis points of margin expansion, this is probably the area I feel the most comfortable with. And so there's some big target areas in terms of what we go after to take these costs out. This is stuff we do, and we do it really, really well. We all have a lot of experience here. The cost piece, it'll get done. I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that one. In terms of your question on WarnerMedia, when will John Stankey relinquish leadership of WarnerMedia, I don't anticipate he will relinquish leadership in WarnerMedia. It's under his purview of COO. And he's got a big job, and he has been spending a lot of time building his leadership team and getting the right people in the right spots and getting HBO stood up. I would tell you on the WarnerMedia side, I think what he has done over there in terms of building the team that's there, the hires he has made, Bob Greenblatt, you're going to get a full dose of Bob Greenblatt tomorrow, and as he launches the HBO Max product. This is an impressive guy. He's got great media chops, been around, a lot of experience. Ann Sarnoff coming in to run Warner Bros. I mean just a really, really impressive hire. As you think about WarnerMedia, I have no doubt he'll find the right person for that job as well. So feel really good about the team that John's assembling and I feel really confident about where he's going. John Hodulik : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So coming back to the buyback, could you talk a little bit about the timing of the buyback? I think you're saying 9% of these outstanding over a 3-year period. But how should we think about that flowing through in Q4 and in 2020? And is there really a number in terms of $25 billion or x number of shares? What's the kind of what you're -- the messaging here? And then coming back to the last question on costs, is there a time frame for Bill Morrow to complete his evaluation and to come back to you and the Board and then potentially to us with more clarity around the buckets, diving into the things that we've just been going over at a high level? Thank you. John Stephens : This is - Simon, this is John. Let me take on the share retirement question. First off, when you take a look at Time Warner transaction, it was about 1.1 billion shares. If you take 70%, it's about the 750 million range of shares. That's the communication we intend. I would suggest to you that we haven't laid out a specific time line for how much each day, how much each month or quarter. We're going through that process now, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is somewhat front-end loaded or at least front-end loaded in individual years. I would tell you we are very respectful of the commitments we made to get into the 2.5 range, and we're going to do that. And I want to make sure this doesn't change that, just like we're going to do this share retirement consistent with getting into that 2 to 2.25 times. Do feel really comfortable operating the business at that level. So it's -- and particularly in today's interest rate environment and our cash flow environment, feel very comfortable with it. But we're going to respect that and make sure we do that. With regard to the process for buybacks, this is -- as you can imagine, we're looking at everything from accelerated share repurchases to open market purchases to other transactional aspects. But I do think it's fair to assume that we would focus on trying to front end load or trying to do more earlier. And within a year, I do not expect it to be smooth. Additionally, within the 3 years, as I expect, we're going to be successful with this plan, we will see our stock price change. And as it changes, our dividend, cash cost of that equity gets adjusted downward. And so you have to continually evaluate the total cost and total investment and total decision-making process. It's a fairly direct decision-making process today, and we will continue to evaluate that. But that's how we're thinking about it and we feel very comfortable about getting it done. It's just a matter of getting the process implemented and moving forward. Nothing to announce on how many shares we may or may not buy in the fourth quarter, but clearly, the commentary we put out that says some share retirements are in the mix for the fourth quarter is a fair statement. Okay. On the cost-initiative side, I mean once again, I will tell you this. This is been going on for a while. We have been going through this process. Bill Morrow, we've been talking to Bill Morrow for a while. And knowing that we wanted to bring on someone with those talents and those skill sets. So we will give him some time to get his feet on the ground, but we expect him to hit the ground running. And we will have plans in place and identified opportunities already that we'll start operationalizing as soon as possible, many of those things before the end of this year. If you're asking about when they will show up in the financial statements and the cost synergies, the savings, I would expect that they're going to be somewhat back-end loaded. They won't all show up in the first year, specifically because there will be some investments and some time to get the plans put into operation. Within our $20 billion capital number, we've set aside some resources for those system investments and for those activities. So feel comfortable about our ability to get those done within this plan. But while as -- while we will show as much urgency as possible to get savings starting with day 1, I would expect that they will be certainly more back-end loaded as opposed to our buy -- our stock retirement program, which may be more front-end loaded. Randall Stephenson : We'll have some that are going to be quick hits. G&A, those are areas where you can generally get some pretty quick hits on cost. We've identified some of those areas. Product simplification, those take a little longer because as John said, you got to make some investments. You remember the last time, though, we took this on, it was probably 5 years ago. Andy Geisse led the effort. And that initiative over a couple of years generated almost $1 billion of cost savings. We're back at one of those moments here again. So I feel pretty confident there are going to be some big chunks of cost that we can get out of the 2-year time frame and some others that will -- we'll get them out in the 2020 time horizon. I think John - what we should just anticipate doing and what you should expect, Simon. We get Q4 earnings, we'll give you an update in terms of where we are at that stage. Bill Morrow starts, I think, today. I believe this is his first day. And so we do want to give him a chance to get his feet on the ground. But as we begin to put the plans together and develop them, we'll give you a status report on the Q4 earnings call and let you know where these are going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. A couple, if I could. Randall, from your own perspective, you've talked about the simplification of the product to basically 2 brands : AT&T TV and HBO Max. How are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio, given that you have a lot of other streaming brands as well as brands such as HBO? And does your guidance contemplate some degree of cannibalization across your entire portfolio? And then, John, from your perspective, you've talked about buybacks potentially being front-end loaded and EBITDA potentially being -- the growth guidance being back-end loaded. Could you talk about the components within that in terms of things like partnerships potentially at DIRECTV or [financing] coming from Turner and so on and so forth? So what are the variables that go into that guidance? If you could just highlight those. Randall Stephenson : Yes. Thanks, Kannan. On the video product simplification, cannibalization or mix shift, I don't know how best to describe it, but obviously, as we roll the software products out and so AT&T TV and this Korean client product, we'll be rolling that out early next year. This is really a good product. And it will become -- for a live streaming product, it will become the workhorse. It's where the lion's share of gross adds move to over the next couple of years. And so that cannibalizes satellite, it replaces satellite. But we actually like if gross adds are coming in on that product, that's a good thing for us for a number of reasons. It's a much lower cost point to put in place with a customer. And as a result, it allows us to meet a much different price point in the market. And -- but with content costs continuing to escalate, these price points are pricing a lot of customers out of the live streaming product. And so we've just been very ambitious to get a new cost structure on our video product that allow us to get people back into the live streaming product. Our research says there are a lot of people that want a live streaming product, but it's just too expensive with the way content costs have gone. So this allows us to get another product in the marketplace at a lower price point, lower cost point, good margins. So that's point number one. HBO Max. HBO Max becomes our SVOD product of the future. And you're going to hear a lot more about this tomorrow. I don't want to steal Stankey and his team's thunder on this. But HBO Max becomes the SVOD platform for AT&T as we move forward into the future. And what you should expect is as we get into the future, this won't be day 1. But over time, that platform -- because of the platform through which we also deliver live stream TV. So you want an SVOD service, HBO Max, great. Over time, we look forward to bringing in live element into HBO Max as well. And so this thing gets more and more simplified and we ultimately get down to where we have two products : the traditional satellite, which will be there for a long time; and then our streaming product, which will be premised on the HBO Max platform. And again, you're going to hear a lot more about this tomorrow night, and I look forward to seeing you there. John Stephens : Kannan, it's John. With regard to the buybacks and the EBITDA discussion. On the buybacks side, as I discussed before, the ability to get cash, get the stock in at very attractive prices from a cash cost of capital will be our focus, and I do expect it to be front-end loaded. On the EBITDA side, I would not use the term back-end loaded on the EBITDA side gains because that would just suggest to you this : Mobility is growing today and it will continue to grow in 2020. Mexico, if you look at -- and we expect Mexico to be EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter. And when we achieve that, we'll have about a $300 million -- just under a $300 million improvement in Mexico's EBITDA this year. And we expect that those trends to continue next year. If you look at WarnerMedia cost savings, the programs are already in place. John Stankey and his team already have those in place, and you see those growing next year. We've got a significant number of items that would -- that are propelling EBITDA improvement, which would propel our standalone EPS guidance that we suggested. The reason for next year being flattish, so to speak, on EBITDA margins is because we're making close to a $2 billion investment in HBO Max. That's the $0.15 to $0.20 that's on our schedules of EPS. So I think of it we're choosing to make an investment on a long-term product, on a long-term winning product that is going to be very important to us. So that's that aspect of it. As I said, we'll have some quick hits. As Randall said, we'll have some quick hits on the cost initiatives led by Bill Morrow, but the full scope of his ability to get all the savings is going to take -- is going to come in over years. But our EBITDA next year on a -- with, inclusive of, our $2 billion investment or in that range in HBO Max, is flattish. If you would take that out, that would be a full 1% growth in our EBITDA. That right there would be about half that growth, that 200 basis point growth we're talking about for the full 3 years. So this is a long-term investment, a good decision-making process like we've done with our acquisition of spectrum, like we've done with our buildout of our wireless network, like we've done with our fiber play. We believe this is a very good long-term decision. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : I want to talk a bit more about wireless here. You've obviously talked a lot about the benefits of the FirstNet investment you flagged, the 50% increase in network capacity through the additional spectrum. You've also expanded your distribution both into the FirstNet or the first responder community as well as in just some new rural markets. And those two things combined you would assume are going to start creating some churn benefits because of the network quality, some gross add benefits because of the expanded distribution. And I'm just curious, where are we in terms of starting to see that in your performance? You've obviously had pretty solid phone net adds. Do you think that there's an opportunity for that to keep inflecting? Is that the real driver of the service revenue CAGR you've put out there? Or are there other elements we should be considering as we structure our models as well? John Stephens : No, thanks for the question. Let me try and go at it this way and ask Randall to jump in and help me out. First of all, with regard to the service revenue increases and the overall performance of the business, the additional spectrum capacity, the ability to put in new technologies like a carrier aggregation, typically it's got, like most kinds of technological improvements as well as this one-touch build opportunity we have with FirstNet, which just gives us a big lead in getting towers 5G-enabled and getting our network ready to be a national 5G network next year. Those are all the base of what we're doing. When you look at our postpaid business, you're right. We have phone growth, voice growth in the third quarter, 100,000. That's the best we've had in 5 years. I think it does have something to do with the quality of our network, the speed of it. I also think it has something to do with the great offers that we have and the efforts of our folks. You saw another strong quarter of prepaid. We're on track to take virtually our -- we're going to have a share of the prepaid net adds this year that I think that equates to the total growth in the market. So we're doing really well with our Cricket brand. It continues to be seller. We're seeing great churn reduction. That's going to help with revenue. We're in an inflection point with our reseller point. We had stepped away from the reseller business because of capacity issues. For the last 4 quarters, our reseller revenue's been essentially flat. So we're now moving towards it with this new capacity from FirstNet, we now have the opportunity to have a real growth from that reseller perspective where we're very interested in that. And then you continue to see what's happening with connected devices, IoT, and quite frankly with 5G+, the millimeter wave-based 5G services for businesses as well as our overall 5G services for businesses, feel really good about. Those are the things that are going to make up that service revenue growth. I would also tell you we continue to see customers buying up to unlimited. They're continuing to buy our quality insurance programs on their more expensive phones. And then on the nonservice side, you'll see the step up to 5G equipment, mainly handsets, particularly for us, we expect to be measurable in share. So you put all of that together, it's really, really very good. Those customer handsets will also bring some cost with them. But what they do, do is give us the opportunity to lock in that customer and refresh that customer and make -- and allow the customer to see this really significant network advantage we have. And so feel good about all those. That's how we're thinking about Mobility. At the same time, they're going through efficiencies and efforts. We'll look at product simplification, our offering simplification there, all of those kinds of things will continue to help keep margins heading in the right direction. Brett Feldman : Can I ask a quick follow-up? That was helpful. You mentioned the reseller business and putting more emphasis on that because of your capacity improvement. One of the key reseller communities you really haven't addressed is the cable MVNOs. Considering the improvement in your network capacity, are you strategically opening to supporting that customer base? John Stephens : Absolutely. Randall Stephenson : Yes. We would actually be open to that. So you should assume that, that's something we'd be open to. And not just cable guys, but there are a number of people in the reseller space that are reaching out. And it's just as John said, we got a lot of capacity now in this network, and we're at the point of evolution in this industry where we ask, how do you monetize most efficiently, capacity? And so we're going to look at all those channels. John Stephens : One last thing, Brett, on the capacity, I want to make sure. We have put in almost 60 megahertz of spectrum nationwide on a base of about 100. So it's a significant increase there. Secondly, all the technology changes, the carrier aggregation and others, have increased our spectral -- our throughput capacity significantly. And then this ability to one-touch and put up 5G. The conversion from a 3G network and some of our older -- or this 4G network into this 5G network is also going to increase. So we've not only got an increased capacity just from the spectral, that's the easiest way to think about it, but all the other steps the network team's doing is dramatically improving our capabilities. And so we have a significant advantage over our competitors and have an ability to compete because of that advantage. Michael Viola : Greg, we'll take one last question. Operator : And that question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Michael Rollins : Just curious if you could describe how the team evaluated the value of share buybacks relative to some incremental investments in the operations, for example, accelerating investments in fiber-to-the-home, especially after the subscriber gains that you've highlighted recently in the segment? And then just separately, AT&T has been bundling video with its wireless subscribers in some form for some time. Can you describe the results that you're seeing and how that impacts both customer acquisition and retention? Randall Stephenson : Mike, this is Randall. As we think about share buybacks and capital expenditures, actually, we're still going to invest at a $20 billion level next year. And that's, I am quite confident, will be, by order of magnitudes, the most aggressive investment in the industry. And we have been on a very aggressive plan for deploying fiber. And we put in a very short period of time 20 million locations passed with fiber. And we are somewhere between 20% and 25% penetrated in that footprint in the next couple years are going to be about penetrating. It's really about penetration. That doesn't mean we're stopping fiber deployment. 5G requires us to continue deploying fiber. We have business customers who have expectations and we deploy fiber into business locations. And what that does is creates capillaries that we then expand off of. And so you're going to continue to see the capillary of fiber in this company expand. It's just not going to expand at the pace we've been going on. It's been on a torrid pace. I would suggest it's been the most aggressive in the United States. Now it's time to reap the rewards of what we've done and let's go penetrate the market. As you think about the video bundles, the strong -- and this is something I find very encouraging. I don't think we've put metrics out on this. I think you will probably talk about it tomorrow. But the most powerful video bundle we have with our mobile business is HBO in terms of what it does to churn and retention. And the reason I think that's very exciting is now think about HBO Max and taking that product to a different level. And it's going to be something different. And now bundling that with our mobile business and the impacts on churn, we believe, are going to be very, very powerful. And so we're very excited about putting wireless with HBO Max. HBO Max is a natural bundle with our -- obviously our video business, whether it's DIRECTV or AT&T TV. It's a great bundle with our broadband business, particularly the fiber business. So we're really bullish right now on how HBO Max gets leveraged across the footprint. When you look at HBO today, keep in mind we've really only owned the asset, post appeal by the courts, since February. So about 8 months is how long it's been under our purview. In a very short period of time, AT&T has moved by order of magnitude into the position as the largest distributor of HBO. And if you look at the number two distributor, we're 62% higher penetrated than the #2 distributor. So we think HBO is a very powerful platform to bundle with our various distribution properties. And you turn HBO into HBO Max, it becomes even more exciting. So thanks for the question, Mike. Michael Viola : Okay. Greg, that ends our Q&A session. Randall Stephenson : So if I could, I would just close out by first of all thanking everybody for joining the call. Look, this is an aggressive 3-year plan. I got to tell you, this is a 3-year plan we've spent a lot of time over the last few months putting together. And as I keep saying, it's time to reap the rewards of the investments we made over the last few months -- years. And so it's a very exciting time for us. The capital allocation plan is very exciting, and we're really excited about HBO Max, and I'm really hopeful to see everybody here in L.A. tomorrow night to preview this product and see what we have to offer at WarnerMedia. So thanks again for joining us, we'll talk to you tomorrow. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stankey, Chief Operating Officer for AT&T and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Randall will begin the call with a brief overview of the 2019 accomplishments and a look at our three-year plans. John Stephens will then discuss fourth quarter results and then John Stankey will walk you through key areas of our 2020 operating plan. John Stephens will then close the presentation with an update on our capital allocation plan and 2020 financial guidance. Then we'll take your questions. Before I begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement, which says that, some of our comments today may be forward-looking and as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 103, so we cannot address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K and other associated schedules. And so, with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Thanks, Mike. I want to start on slide three to close out 2019. And coming into 2019, we laid out a detailed plan for the year and that plan was the series of specific steps necessary to exit 2019 on a path of sustained growth. A simple summary on slide three is that we met or exceeded every single one of those objectives and the road map is set for the next three years. I told you that our top priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and exit the year at around 2.5 times debt to EBITDA, done. We have now reduced net debt by about $30 billion since we closed Time Warner. And at the end of 2019, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was about 2.5 times. We gave you the formula for exactly what it would take to get to this debt level. First, we would need to generate $26 billion of free cash flow, done. We exceeded that handily, generating a record $29 billion for the year. Second, we would need to monetize non-strategic assets and generate $6 billion to $8 billion of cash, done. We actually generated nearly $18 billion, more than double our target. And we've already announced an additional $2 billion, which will close in 2020. On adjusted EPS, we came in right on plan, low single-digit growth. At WarnerMedia, we achieved the 2019 merger synergies and we're preparing to launch HBO Max in May. Growing wireless service revenues was critical and those revenues were up nearly 2% for the full year. We stabilized Entertainment Group EBITDA and brought in our capital investment right on plan. And after sustained investment in our network, AT&T exited 2019 with the best and fastest wireless network in the United States. Our 5G network covers 50 million people today and we expect to have nationwide 5G coverage in the second quarter. As we look forward, our 2019 performance positions us well for the next three years. Our plan is very straightforward and we've laid it out for you on slide four. We see revenue growth every year and expect a 1% to 2% three-year CAGR through 2022. By 2022, adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 200 basis points, adjusted EBITDA grows by about $6 billion, free cash flow is between $30 billion and $32 billion and adjusted EPS grows to between $4.50 and $4.80. This is a plan that generates a lot of cash over the next three years. And the Board has developed a very thoughtful capital allocation approach that will maintain a solid balance sheet and drive shareholder value. First, we'll continue to invest aggressively and at top-tier levels into our core businesses. We expect to invest $20 billion in 2020. Leading in 5G is critical for AT&T and we're not slowing down. We're more than 75% complete on our FirstNet build and that will continue. And we're continuing to deploy fiber. In terms of our capital structure, over the last 18 months we've retired the lion's share of the debt we issued to acquire Time Warner. And we'll continue to pay down debt, but at a much slower pace. Our cash will be focused over the next three years on retiring the shares we issued to acquire Time Warner. By the end of 2022, we will have retired 100% of the debt and 70% of the shares from our Time Warner transaction. In fact, we retired 56 million of these shares in 2019. We also plan to retire about 100 million more in the first quarter of this year to a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. By 2022, our leverage target is a very comfortable net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0 to 2.25 times. You can also expect us to continue streamlining our portfolio as we monetize additional assets of $5 billion to $10 billion this year. And as I said earlier, we've already executed agreements that will generate $2 billion this year. John Stephens will cover the specific steps in the plan later. But first, he's going to cover our fourth quarter results. So I'll turn it over to you now John. John Stephens : Thanks, Randall. Let me begin with the financial summary on slide 6. As Randall mentioned, we hit or exceeded all our 2019 targets. Let's take a closer look. We grew earnings. Adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 3.5% for the quarter and up 1.4% for the full year. Cash from operations came in strong at $11.9 billion for the quarter and $48.7 billion for the year. Free cash flow was a record $29 billion for the full-year, up 30%. The addition of WarnerMedia made an impact as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts. Our ability to generate cash continues to provide a strong foundation for our capital allocation plan. We continue to aggressively invest. CapEx was nearly $20 billion for the full year and total gross capital investment was $23.7 billion, when you include our investments in FirstNet and other vendor payments. And without the impact of foreign exchange and forgone licensing revenue in advance of our HBO Max launch, fourth quarter and full year revenues would have been $48 billion and about $184 billion, representing growth in both the quarter and the year. Even with these items, operating income margins were stable in the quarter and up 70 basis points for the year. All in all, a very good year as we hit our 2019 targets. Let's now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on slide 7. In our Communications segment, mobility continues to build momentum and deliver solid results. Service revenue grew by about 2% in the quarter and for the year. EBITDA grew both in the quarter and for the year. And EBITDA margins expanded by 40 basis points for the year, while service margins were stable even with a heavily promotional fourth quarter. Postpaid phone growth was solid adding 229,000 in the quarter. For the year, we had about one million phone net adds both postpaid and prepaid. This strong performance was driven by our industry-leading network and came even while postpaid phone churn was up as competitors ramped up promotional efforts. You should note total churn postpaid and prepaid combined improved year-over-year by 12 basis points. As Randall mentioned, our Entertainment Group hit its full year target of EBITDA stability. Long-term customer value continues to be our focus as we head into 2020. That focus has helped drive growth in video and IP broadband ARPUs. AT&T Fiber continues to grow adding nearly 200,000 customers. That brings us to nearly four million AT&T Fiber customers and we have lots of room left to grow. Premium video net losses improved sequentially by more than 200,000 subscribers, but video losses continue to impact our broadband numbers, especially our bundled customers. Our new simplified video offerings position us for the long term and our subscriber trends are improving. Let's turn to Business Wireline. The trends in Business Wireline continued to improve. Revenues grew sequentially and were down just 1.7% year-over-year. And when you include wireless, Business Solutions grew 1.1%. EBITDA was relatively steady in the quarter and EBITDA margins were up 40 basis points. Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on slide 8. WarnerMedia had a great quarter when you consider the decision to forego content licensing revenue. Subscriber revenue growth at both Turner and HBO combined with lower film and television production cost at Warner Bros. helped to offset that pressure. We made the strategic decision to give HBO Max exclusive streaming rights for top programs including Friends, Big Bang Theory and other popular shows. In the past, we would have sold these externally. Looking at the impact on the fourth quarter, WarnerMedia revenues would have grown by about 10% if these shows would have been sold. In fact that 10% organic growth would represent WarnerMedia's best growth rate in three years. And EBITDA would have increased by about $300 million or about 11%. Obviously this has an upfront cost for us, but we see this as an investment that makes HBO Max even stronger and will pay off over the long-term. The big news in our Latin American operations is Mexico turning EBITDA positive in the quarter. The team has done an excellent job of reducing costs and growing revenue in a challenging environment. Fourth quarter Mexico EBITDA improved nearly $200 million year-over-year and improved by more than $300 million for the full year. We continue to press for further gains. A new wholesale agreement with Telef\u00f3nica will add to both revenues and EBITDA. Going forward we expect continued improvement. Vrio continues to work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds. But even in this environment, it continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flows. Now, let me turn it over to John Stankey to cover our 2020 operating plan and then I'll come back and discuss a capital allocation update. John? John Stankey : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 10. These are the four key areas of our 2020 operating plan where we'll be focused in executing to drive our performance. I'll go into some detail on each of these over the next few minutes but I'll give you the headlines first. Number one is continuing our momentum in mobility because we expect mobility will continue to be the biggest driver of revenue growth and profitability and be a key factor in meeting our 2020 goals. Second, a successful launch of HBO Max is critical to our plans in each of the next three years. Many of you are with us for the Analyst Day in October and have seen firsthand why we're so excited about HBO Max and the opportunities it gives us. We're right on track to launch it in May. Third, is growing our broadband revenues by increasing our fiber penetration. Key to this will be bundling our fiber broadband offer with AT&T TV, which is delivered over our software based video architecture. And finally, we're laser focused on improving both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our overall operations and as a result, driving additional costs out of the business. Let me dive into each of these four drivers beginning with mobility on slide 11. Last year our wireless network was recognized as the nation's best and also fastest thanks in part to our FirstNet build. In fact, we did a few of our own spot test in December to see how our existing nationwide 5G evolution network compared to the 5G network one of our competitors rolled out last month. In three out of the four test cities, our network had faster speeds and lower latency on average. The point is our strong spectrum position gives us a leg up and allows us to execute a different 5G deployment strategy than our competitors. We have the low and mid-band spectrum to deploy 5G nationwide. We cover 50 million people today and expect to be nationwide in the second quarter. We also have the millimeter wave spectrum we need to deploy 5G+ and its gigabit speeds and super low latency to more densely populated cities. We're in 35 cities today and we're adding more this year. There's an important point to be made here once we have 5G nationwide. As you know smartphone upgrades across the industry have been down for a while now. In fact, we're coming off a record low upgrade rate for any fourth quarter in our history. But fast forward to the back half of this year when popular 5G smartphones and devices should be more available at scale, you can expect higher upgrade rates and equipment revenue growth. The timing for this upgrade cycle couldn't be more perfect when you consider that we'll be offering HBO Max on our highest ARPU wireless plans with features tuned for premium media consumption and at a time when people are coming into our stores to upgrade. It's a natural opportunity to further the distribution of HBO Max, while adding new mobility subscribers and improving our wireless ARPUs. HBO Max's content has something for everyone in the family and that makes it a natural fit for our nearly 25 million postpaid accounts that average more than three lines per account. As a result, we expect our wireless service revenue growth rate to be higher in 2020. And after adding nearly 1 million phone net adds in 2019, both postpaid and prepaid, we expect 2020 will be an even better year for net adds. FirstNet plays an important role here. We now serve more than 10,000 first responder agencies and more than 1 million connections with FirstNet. We expect those numbers will grow nicely as our FirstNet deployment reaches 80% in new devices and capabilities come to market in the coming months. We also expect a higher adoption of our unlimited plans. We're at a little more than 50% penetration today, but we expect the 5G device upgrade cycle will bring into our stores lots of customers not on unlimited plans today. Increasing the adoption of our best unlimited plans is obviously an ARPU growth opportunity for us. And when you add into the mix the customers on select unlimited plans will get HBO Max for free, it's a great opportunity to also improve our overall churn which we've seen happen from giving HBO to current unlimited customers. A reduction of one basis point of wireless churn across the base is worth about $100 million to us annually. Sum it up; we're expecting growth of more than 2% in mobility service revenues this year. Let's go to Slide 12 and the headlines for why we believe HBO Max will be a game-changer for our customers and for AT&T. I expect many of you were at the HBO Max Analyst Day in October and you heard me talk about the three pillars required for success in streaming; premier content; the technology platform; and marketing and distribution. Only AT&T has a space with a solid footing in all three. My excitement and confidence in the HBO Max opportunity have only grown since then. The team has made tremendous progress in every area and we're on track to launch in May with a unique offering. Quite simply, we believe HBO Max will be the highest quality premium SVOD in the market with a great experience, better curation, and higher percentage of culturally relevant offerings than competing products. We're excited to launch HBO Max coming off the tail end of one of our strongest awards seasons ever with new and exciting breakthrough offerings leading the way. We captured an industry-leading 34 Emmys and six Golden Globe awards. Joker had more Academy Award nominations than any other film, highlighting our deep and diverse theatrical content. The awards are only the latest indicator that we continue to create high-quality culturally relevant content that appeals to a broad consumer base. And our additional investment in great content is only going to expand the appeal of the service. With HBO Max, we'll offer consumers more than twice the amount of programming for the same price as HBO today. We're making great progress on the HBO product platform as well. Our controlled nonpublic beta is getting solid reviews and we're gaining invaluable feedback on important but subtle issues like user navigation and screen layout. This work is no less important than award-winning content. Finally, we continue to fine-tune our go-to-market plans consistent with the unique position with which we enter the market, leveraging our extensive AT&T distribution and embedded base of more than 30 million domestic HBO subscribers. We're in active discussions across our potential distribution partners both digital platforms and MVPDs. We're making progress and we expect we'll have deals to announce prior to launch. Our focus continues to be on providing a compelling value proposition for our HBO distribution partners and our mutual customers. Our more than 10 million HBO subscribers on AT&T distribution platforms will be offered immediate access to HBO Max at launch, so we'll get off to a fast start. To drive incremental growth, we have unique advantages when combining media and distribution including our 170 million direct customer relationships across mobile, pay TV and broadband. Plus, we have 5500 retail stores who will be focused on driving incremental HBO Max adoption by bundling it with premium-tiered wireless, broadband or pay TV offers. And we'll use AT&T customer insights for WarnerMedia advertising analytics and curation. We have very high expectations for HBO Max. And at the same time we're thrilled about the possibilities of increasing the adoption of higher ARPU services and strengthening the long-term value proposition of our highest quality and highest ARPU customers. We fully expect HBO Max will have a positive and immediate impact on the stickiness of our wireless and pay TV and broadband offerings. Now let's look at Entertainment Group. Those details are on Slide 13. Our EG team delivered our target of stable EBITDA last year. In 2020 you're going to see us apply the same high-value customer-centric focus, while increasing our fiber customer base and launching AT&T TV. We'll see higher amortization cost in the video business in the first quarter which creates some tough year-over-year comparisons for EG EBITDA but on a cash from operations basis we expect EG to be stable in 2020 versus last year. We believe the greatest opportunity within EG is to significantly grow our AT&T Fiber customer base and broadband revenues. We have 4 million fiber customers today and our recent fiber expansion gives us 14 million locations to sell into. Based on our fiber sales experience we expect to exit 2022 with about 3 million more fiber customers than we have today or a total of about 7 million. This will be a significant lift in market share compared to our traditional performance in our legacy hybrid fiber copper-based footprint. It represents an organic market share growth opportunity on an existing product that I've never experienced in my career. Where we offer competitive broadband speeds you can expect that we'll lean into video acquisition given the better economics of our improved product portfolio including AT&T TV and HBO Max all software-based products with low acquisition costs. Within our broadband footprint expected as we exit the year our premium video subscriber declines will be more in line with overall video industry trends. Looking at our total premium video customer base, we expect year-over-year improvements in the subscriber losses. Now let's turn to Slide 14 to talk about our efficiency and cost initiatives. New work to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations has progressed over the past few months. We previously shared with you that we're targeting an additional 4% reduction in labor-related costs including benefits and contract employees in 2020 alone. That work will ramp quickly and we plan for it to deliver $1.5 billion in additional cost savings. In fact we've already identified and implemented about half of those savings. Another significant opportunity for us is product information technology rationalization. We feel comfortable that we can generate another $2 billion of annual run rate efficiencies exiting 2022. This will come from thinning our product portfolio, simplifying our market offers, rationalizing call centers, modernizing our information technology and enhancing the level of customer self support. In addition, streamlining will have the added benefit of enhancing our market agility and ultimately lead to improved market effectiveness. Our assessment work continues and I expect in the next 90 days we'll have additional efficiency initiatives underway for some of our network, corporate, sales and procurement functions. I'll turn it back to John now for his look at capital allocation 2020 financial guidance. John Stephens : Thanks, John. Strengthen our balance sheet was our top priority last year and our teams did an excellent job of reducing debt and monetizing our asset portfolio. This allowed us to begin retiring shares at the end of last year while still meeting our net debt ratio goals. In 2020, you can expect that momentum to continue. It all starts with strong free cash flows. We had record free cash flow last year and expect to be in a similar range this year. We achieved this even with some voluntary funding for retiree medical costs and higher tax payments in the fourth quarter. We also overachieved on asset monetizations. We expect to do another $5 billion to $10 billion net monetizations this year with significant efforts already underway. At the same time, we continue to evolve our capital structure. We added more preferred to our capital stack last year when we monetized more than $6 billion of our long-term tower purchase options. And we also issued $1.2 billion of traditional preferred stock. The publicly traded preferred stock is new to us but there is a market for it and it provides investors another alternative to invest with AT&T. In fact, these shares are currently trading at a premium to par. Investors are looking for secured dependable returns, which is exactly what this offers. And dividend rates at less than our common stock dividend yield make it attractive for us. The tower preferreds also allow us to use very long-term assets to generate cash in a tax-efficient manner. We also continue to be focused on our three-year debt reduction targets. Depending on the timing of share retirements and asset monetizations, you will see our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios fluctuate throughout the year but we expect to continue reducing debt for the full year and intend to target leverage in the two to 2.25 range by the end of 2022. Our share retirement has begun in earnest. We told you we wanted to buy shares as early in the year as possible and that is what you're seeing. Thanks to our $4 billion ASR, we've already bought back about 85 million shares in January and expect to see another 20 million in the remainder of the first quarter. You can expect us to continue to buy back shares during the remainder of the year and meet or exceed our 250 million share retirement target for 2020. That's on top of the 56 million shares we bought back in 2019. We have a lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure. We're focused on managing debt and have a wealth of opportunities with our balance sheet as we showed last year. You can expect us to continue to manage it in a prudent way including issuing additional preferred shares. Now let me revisit our 2020 guidance on Slide 17. Our guidance remains consistent with what we told you in October. This year more so than most, our results will be more weighted to the second half of the year. For example, in the first part of the year, we expect pressure from heavy HBO Max investment, which you saw begin in the fourth quarter. And in EG, higher content and noncash amortization costs as well as continued pressure on video subs. But in the second half of the year you will see our momentum build. For example, share retirements have been aggressive and will continue and the EPS benefits will flow increasingly throughout the year. HBO Max will have launched leading to strong subscriber growth. The run rate benefits of our cost reduction plans will be clearly visible. And 5G combined with HBO Max will drive more upgrades and stronger wireless revenue growth later in the year. Again, all of this has been factored into our full year guidance. With that in mind, here's what we've committed to : 1% to 2% revenue growth; adjusted EPS of $3.60 to $3.70 a share; stable adjusted EBITDA margins; free cash flow in the $28 billion range, with our dividend payout ratio in the low 50s; gross capital investment in the $20 billion range and this doesn't include our investments in content; continued debt reduction with share retirement of 250 million or more common shares in 2020; and our net asset monetizations between $5 billion and $10 billion. Mike, that concludes our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A. Michael Viola : Operator, we'll take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik. Please, go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions for John Stankey. Yes. Thanks for the commentary on the entertainment sub trends, but maybe a little bit more clarity. I mean, first of all, you saw a slowdown in fiber adds in the quarter. What was driving that? And, I guess, in conjunction with the guidance for sort of more improvement in the back end of the year, do you expect that trend to reverse? Or when -- how do you expect those adds to sort of play out over the course of the year? And what drives the acceleration? And then, in terms of the HBO Max guidance, the $500 million in incremental expense we saw in 2019, does that impact your guidance for the $2 billion in 2020? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, John. Happy New Year. So, first of all, fourth quarter of 2019, fourth quarter is seasonally a slower quarter. December is a pretty slow month in general for home-based services, given the dynamics of the holiday and the like, so that's part of the contribution to the issue of the slowdown. The second is, our gross add performance on video wasn't strong. You see the subscriber trends. As we've shared with you, as we move through this year and we start shifting to AT&T TV, our gross add performance starts to get much stronger. And naturally, when you're able to put AT&T TV, a software-based product with fiber, it's a much more natural combination than a satellite dish and fiber. And so, as we start to roll out AT&T TV now in markets and we move in, we're going to see much stronger performance on the fiber side. I'll tell you, as I look at where we are right now in current customer trends, I feel pretty good that that's, in fact, the case and we're going to be where we need to be on that. Frankly, it's not a hard sell. It's a great product. It's a product that customers like. I think, we could do very well with it and I don't expect that we're going to see that continue through. So, that's what I would tell you. You're going to see recovery in 2020. On the Max side, we gave you a range on what to expect in 2020 in terms of dilution, that we're not changing any of that range. The range is a range for a reason. There's a lot of moving parts on Max introduction. It's a combination of both, going to market with subscribers and it's a product that's going to continue to grow over the coming years. And we're going to be looking in the market for opportunities for other content acquisition and the like. And it's entirely possible, we may be opportunistic, or look at something and we want the management team to have that flexibility to be able to balance those things out. We have subscriber growth coming and things are working well with our strategies. We make it a little heavier on trying to build up subscribers and what we expected. I think, that's the nature of building a new and subscription-oriented business. And so, that range is important that we have the flexibility for the management team to do what they want to do. We feel very strongly we're going to get back that investment as we build this new distribution platform over the coming years, that's why we're doing this. We like the dynamic of ultimately having some control of those customers and being in a position where we can manage that life cycle going forward. And we think it's a good smart long-term investment. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. John, can you update us on the WarnerMedia strategy from here away from Max? We see video industry bundled units declining pretty quickly even away from you as you decelerate. How does that change your thoughts on Turner over time and the strategic value there? And then can you also give us an update on the low-value video subs that are remaining in the base and how those should come out over the next few quarters? Thanks very much. John Stankey : Sure. Happy to do that Phil. So, if you step back and think about the position we sit in the -- what I would call the traditional pay TV universe, I mean everybody knows it's in transition. And it's a mature product that's kind of working its way through the back end of a life cycle. But I like where we stand in that and that our total percentage of cost of goods sold in that space relative to the size of the bundle that the customer buys is not huge. Our network portfolio is a fairly concentrated network portfolio. If you think about it the bulk of our profitability comes from three primary networks, its TNT, TBS, and CNN. And I think if you look at trends, we all know that general entertainment content and the bundle is not performing as well and the nice part about our two general entertainment networks TNT and TBS, these are really hybrids. They're a combination of general entertainment and sports. And so they historically perform at the upper end of desirability from a ratings perspective and attractiveness from an advertisers' perspective because of that mix of content that we have. So, one having more contained portfolio; and two, having that mix of content I think is important to basically ride through this transition and have some resiliency. And my view of what's been happening in most carriage agreement negotiations, as we go back out in the market and renew things is our distributors see that and understand that those are important networks to carry forward. And we're continuing to see that people place value on those things even in a more skinny down or a smaller pay TV universe moving forward and feel pretty good about that. Now, let's be clear, the reason we're doing Max is we also know that new distribution platforms need to be out there that are the growth platforms and that match general entertainment content how consumers want to see them. And that pivot between what we're doing with linear networks and what we're doing with Max is a key part of the WarnerMedia strategy. It's an important dance and choreography that we have to do to get that right. And we feel we're positioned very well and make that happen. We spent a lot of time in the Investor Day explaining why we think it's a natural place to go. To keep the networks relevant what you should expect us to do, we will continue to invest that -- in them. We'll continue to make sure that they're viable for our distributors, but you'll see the content shift start to occur a little bit. What we see with subscribers is that obviously they like news and sports. They also like content that's socially relevant. And so probably a mix of starting to see a little bit more unscripted content come in, things that cause people go into the office and talk about it around the water cooler. And that will probably start to supplant hours. It might have been more general entertainment-oriented content that you are going to see showing up on SVOD platforms like HBO Max moving forward. And we think that mix in conjunction with what we're doing with Max will allow us to ensure that the content we're producing in our great studios across our different brands will have a place to market that we can monetize with end user either through distributors in the traditional fashion or through direct-to-consumer constructs where maybe we have a direct relationship with the customer. On the subscriber pay TV low-value construct, look we're mostly through that. I would tell you we've got a little bit more work to do on some promotional roll-offs in the first quarter that is going to continue to show up. And when we shared -- as I shared earlier, what's going to happen on subscriber trends that I think will be more at the rate of decline by the time we exit this year, you should expect you're going to see continuing improvement in our subscriber trends each quarter as we move through. But I will tell you, you just can't flip a switch and get there overnight. And that's why I'm kind of suggesting you should think that we're on a glide path to get back to that ratable decline with subscriber base decline in the aggregate pay TV industry by the time we exit the year. We're going to see probably our heaviest losses in first quarter. When I look at what's happening from an operational performance perspective and what the team is doing on gross add improvements, what we're seeing in churn improvements, the rollout of AT&T TV that really hits its stride in the second quarter in terms of its availability across the customer base, we'll start to see those subscriber trends incrementally improve as those capabilities start to roll into the base. And we'll get to what I just indicated by the time we exit the year. Philip Cusick : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, John. John Stankey : Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Take the next question Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, good morning. Thank you. Randall, we put out a lot of targets here for 2020 and beyond. Perhaps you could just share about how the executive incentives are being set up for the year, what the KPIs and metrics are. I know last year deleveraging was I think 25% of the short -- or 20% of the short-term comp. So any color you could give around what the two or three key focuses are for the year? And then one for John Stankey, you talked about the investment in the network, the capacity there. I think in the past you've talked about the opportunities in the wholesale market. Perhaps you could just give us an update on how things are going there and the opportunity perhaps to sign up some cable companies. Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Hi, Simon this is Randall. Yeah, as you articulated and for those who aren't familiar, coming into 2019 I told all of you that our number one priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and get our leverage ratios down to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. And it was going to require strong cash flow generation, selling some non-core assets. All that was instrumental in getting there. And to really drive at home and get the focus for the management team as you said, we set that debt-to-EBITDA target as a significant amount of executive compensation and mission accomplished. I think the team executed at an amazing level in terms of identifying asset opportunities to dispose, getting those things driven through the process, negotiated actually getting good prices for all of those assets and then driving just strong cash flows and some impressive working capital opportunities we're taking advantage of and these working capital initiatives that are put in place are not one and done. What we're most excited about are these are working capital initiatives that are repeatable. And so I feel really good about our ability to generate in 2020 even with the HBO Max investments another $28 billion of free cash flow. Coming into this year, the debt objective of 2.5 times isn't what we're working towards. What we're working towards is making sure we're continuing to generate the cash flow to execute the broader capital allocation strategy, meaning more specifically retiring the shares we issued for Time Warner. And as both John Stephens and I articulated in our opening comments that is a focus, and our objective is to retire at least 250 million additional shares this year. We'll get about 100 million of those knocked out in the first quarter. And there's at least 150 million more to be coming in the back part of the year that will generate nice EPS accretion as we move throughout the course of the year. And so all that said, the management team is going to be focused on hitting these earnings objectives that we've laid out for you and the cash flow targets. And that's what compensation will be really focused on. And I think it's going to be effective in generating the cash we need to execute the share buyback programs and the overall capital allocation strategy. John Stankey : Simon thanks for asking the question, because I think it highlights a really important aspect of how we're going to grow wireless revenues next year, because we already have that strength as you indicated the network performance and that perception. As we do research out the market is now starting to grow amongst the customer base. I think we have some plans to even fine-tune our brand positioning messages as we move into this year a little bit more. And we know that as we move that perception, which is happening right now, we see momentum in subscriber growth. And so we've got just pure subscriber economics that are going to help us there, make some shifts in distribution. We've got the tailwinds of FirstNet behind us, which are starting to help us dramatically. And I think the coverage improvements that occur as we get into the second phase of FirstNet will allow us to move through that. And then we talked about just a few minutes ago what we're doing on the upgrade cycles and the Max launch. There's a lot of good things moving our direction what I would call the core organic part of the wireless business to grow revenues. And frankly over the last several years, our wholesale business had been a bit of a headwind in our wireless business, because we didn't have the flash capacity that we've now been able to turn up with these key investments over the last 1.5 years. We're now in a much different position than we've historically been and where we've had to be very guarded about our wholesale position largely because we needed capacity to support our retail base. And we're now, I think in a position in the industry when I look at what has to happen with people either in a deal or no-deal situation in spectrum and their spectrum holdings that we are probably more flashed than others in the industry. And we can in fact play in a different way in the wholesale space. We're not just focused on cable. I think we want to do as I've indicated previously the right deal, a deal that's constructive for the industry in general. Certainly if there was an opportunity to do something in that space, we might do it. But there's a lot of other wholesale options out there that we expect to lean into and I expect we can step up to in the most accretive fashion possible. And what I would indicate to you that I think whether you believe a T-Mobile, Sprint deal occurs or doesn't occur either way they are going to need to be partners in the industry that need to round out networks and do some things differently. And we would also try to understand whether or not we have other partners in the industry or merging partners in the industry that we can help with on the wholesale side. So, there are plenty of options for us to go and start pulling that wholesale lever and driving it up. And I think that will be an incremental difference for us than what we've seen over the last couple of years that we've been managing that number down. John Stephens : Simon to add to what John said, this is the first year that we've had stable reseller revenues throughout the year. And in fact sequentially, we grew reseller revenues and in year-over-year and the fourth quarter. So what John is talking about, we are not only well positioned for, but it's starting in a small way right now but with the opportunity to make much bigger. It's already occurring and it's contributing to that service revenue growth that we've had both in the quarter and the year. Simon Flannery : Thanks. John Stankey : Thanks Simon. We\u2019ll take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two, first John Stankey your -- it sounds like you guys really have bought into this idea of 5G smartphone super cycle. And I feel like that is not a consensus view. I know that there's a lot of debate about it internally here between our tech guys and our chipset guys and our phone guys. And so if you could kind of give us some perspective on where that conviction comes from that that we're going to get enough of a boost in demand for products that, I don't know that the consumers really understand it's a lot different than what they're already buying that would be super helpful? And then John Stephens, could you walk us through the science behind this kind of new embrace of the preferred securities? Because it seems a little odd to be buying back stock, but then at the same time issuing preferred stock and debt has deductible interest and preferreds don't. And so I think that there's some confusion as to kind of what the net benefit to the equity holder is of kind of looking at preferreds and capital stack? Thank you. John Stankey : Dave so I don't know that I would use the term super cycle. I don't look at the plan and say, we're expecting a super cycle. But we are expecting an increase or a step-up in what's occurring. And look I think that the foundation of that assumption is based on we've done a couple of different area interface changes. We did the UMTS air interface change. We did the LTE air interface change. And I think there were similar discussions going on at that point in time. Well will somebody really need the increased LTE speed over UMTS? It works perfectly fine. And I would tell you we do see this step-up occur because naturally speaking people have a tendency to sit around and run speed test on their devices. And when somebody next to them is getting better performance, it raises awareness amongst the subscriber base. And I expect that there's going to be a certain number of folks who look at that and just say because that device performs better because these new devices have access to a much broader swath of bands it's going to perform better. And we are going to see a degree of uptick simply because the subscriber base is going to notice that there is a degree of performance etcetera as a result of that. Secondly as I said we're going to be driving some of this ourselves. We're going to be out there with some pretty aggressive promotion on HBO Max and we're going to be tying these to our better plans. And when you look at what we're assuming in our business plan for the year, our increases in the number of customers moving into unlimited aren't crazy silly step function changes. They're more of the trend and taking advantage of the fact that we are going to put more advertising dollars into the market to support Max and support 5G. And we'll get some nominal uptick in what those migrations into our higher-value unlimited plans are. So we want to stimulate some of that. We're coming off of historic lows of upgrades. And we think the market is set up to basically go through renewal cycle given, how we're promoting. It's coming at the end of the year in the holiday season. There's going to be better networks out there. We do expect there's going to be an uptick in the upgrade cycle. Super cycle maybe a little bit too strong a word than an uptick yes. David Barden : Got it. John Stephens : And just to add to what John said, we have had three years here of very low upgrade rates. Just to some extent people are going to need new phones. And so this is just also this aging of the phone base has been occurring over multiple years. Secondly, this is the first time we're going to have a 5G network up and running and available before the devices are out, the next-generation networks in there. And as John made very clear, the HBO Max and other products we have they would really meld well. The convergence of all three of those things is going to be really attractive for us. With regard to the science of a preferred it's simply this. The market is open to it. Investors want it. They like this certainty. At today's rates, our preferred that's out there is actually trading below 5% yield about a 4.7%, 4.8%. I am seeing it today about a 4.8% yield. So that's lower cash cost than our common dividend, so that saves us money there. Secondly, as you know they don't share in the common profits of it. Third, it's a diversification for us. And so it gives us an opportunity to go into a different investor base. So just like we had done over the last 10 years have really diversified our debt base. This gives us an opportunity to diversify our shareholder base. And we believe that that's good for everybody and also allows us to bring in the volume or the quantum of common shares that are out there. Additionally, when you look at the preferred partnership interest that we've done and the preferred interest, we've done there, that has a very efficient \u2013 those dividend costs are much lower, because they're very tax efficient. So those costs get well below 4%. And once again, they allow us to give recognition to assets that people may not have realized. For example, our tower receivables and over $6 billion worth of real option cash that we have a high likelihood of getting, I don't know that anybody was paying much attention to that. Now it gives us the opportunity to put that spotlight that we really already achieved that value. So \u2013 but the clear science of the preferred is; one, the dividend costs are lower than our common; second, they're stable and our common is going to continue to grow; third, it gets us to another market segment, another investor base which is helpful; and fourth, that allows us to reduce the reliance on the common share base that's out there. For that perspective, we feel very good about. I feel like it's a really \u2013 it's a good move for all of our shareholders. Michael Viola : Thanks, Dave. Greg, we will take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. If you fast forward to the end of your financial plan in 2022 given the CapEx that you've articulated, can you frame what the network capabilities are going to look like for 5G mobile, fixed wireless broadband coverage, and fiber-to-the-home coverage? And then secondly, can you just unpack a little more of what you see driving the strength in industry wireless postpaid phone net add? And as you look at your own customer trend are you seeing any meaningful differences in customers and markets that have 5G evolution versus those that haven't received it yet? Thanks. John Stankey : Sure. So, Mike, let me see, if I can hit a combination of things you laid out. So first of all, I think one of the significant shifts you'll see in 2022 by the time we get to that point and a lot of this is being driven by work on FirstNet is I think we'll be in a much better position on macro coverage and not only from a number of square miles, but I think you're going to see the improvement in core interior performance given how we densify things to support our FirstNet subscribers and the agencies we have there. And as I said, this is really \u2013 where last year was a year of us getting coverage \u2013 macro coverage in place kind of getting the umbrella, the footprint turned up this year is where we do a lot of the \u2013 make the network better stuff. So we've been doing all the site acquisition, all the fill-in. And we start turning up sites and just going to make the network better. It's going to make the network better on the inside of a building that's going to make the network better in terms of the square miles that are covered. And when you add that to the great spectrum position that you're already seeing and the wonderful reviews of speed and performance that we're getting back on test today, that only makes things stronger. Secondly we are as you know in filling with millimeter wave and we've already turned up over 30 markets with millimeter wave. We're continuing to increase that footprint. And we're going to be very opportunistic of where we can do that. We're in a unique position especially in the places where we offer wireline businesses that we can densify on a fiber infrastructure in a way that's really economic and is advantageous to our cost structure as we move forward. That millimeter wave fill-in is where you're going to get unique performance characteristics. It will be obviously, probably more pronounced in the urban areas of large cities. Our plan right now is we're not as optimistic as maybe some are on what I would call the fixed wireless replacement construct. We obviously believe there'll be some part of the subscriber base that might decide that they don't need a fixed broadband connection. I think that's going to take a couple of years to start to emerge when you get the density a little bit more robust, I think as we see more mid-band spectrum coming in place to support the millimeter wave and make the performance a little bit more consistent. So I wouldn't tell you any of our financial plans and our business plans. We're out there expecting wonderful revenue increases from a push in the fixed wireless space. On what we do in the fixed space, you should expect that we're going to continue to add to the wireless \u2013 excuse me, the fiber footprint. Right now as we've shared with you our goal is to get a little better return out of what we've deployed because between consumer and business we have about 20 million locations, we can be aggressively working penetration in. And we think that we need to ensure we've got the right business practices and marketing practices to get the return on that footprint that's there. And as soon as I get indications that the team is actually executing on that well and we have the right formula on it, we'll probably release the ticket on some additional bill. You should expect just by natural growth of the population, you'll probably see somewhere between 350,000 to 0.5 million new fiber locations coming into the portfolio. Right now that is just kind of what I would call the natural growth rate that's going to happen. If we step that up a little bit, it will be because we feel good about how we're executing on the embedded footprint we have in place. And we know exactly where the next incremental place as we go and build. And I think it's entirely possible that this operating team could build another 1 million to 2 million a year, if we felt like we had the operating momentum to do that. On the postpaid trends, look there's \u2013 the difference between prepaid and postpaid is changing. It's getting \u2013 they're getting closer together. We've been in a situation where we frankly as we shared with you our prepaid base looks a lot more like a postpaid base in what may be the broader industry prepaid base looks like. Once we get these folks on prepaid, once we get them on smartphones, we start seeing churn characteristics with multiline accounts that are very similar to what we have in postpaid. And so, I think as the economy has improved as the differences between the two products have gotten a little less as smartphones have worked their way into the prepaid base because of the cycle of maybe previous generation phones being available, we see customers now starting to opt into a postpaid construct. Does that reverse itself, if we see some economic headwinds and maybe people become a little bit more careful about what they do? That's possible. But the net of it is when you look at whether a customer goes with our prepaid offer or a postpaid offer, we have a lot of similar characteristics between the two. It's \u2013 we can hit them in both places. But we feel very comfortable that we can catch the transition if there's more of a move to postpaid which is what I think is occurring, largely driven by economy and the way the networks are performing and the differences between the two products. Michael Viola : Thanks Mike. Great. We'll take one more question. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. A couple if I could. Firstly, I mean, when you think about the decline rates of video at DIRECTV, although it will moderate over the course of 2020 based on your guidance. If at some point, DIRECTV becomes smaller than say Comcast and because of the video losses and those lines cross, is there any kind of an impact on your programming cost because of the most stable nation clauses and others that you get on account of your scale? And how does that impact margins if it does? And secondly, when you think about the attach rates for broadband in video homes, could you give us a sense of what that is? And within the base of homes that you've lost as a result of the promotional loss last year, is it in line with the average? Or is it higher or lower? That will help us get a sense of where trends are. Thanks. John Stankey : So, the short answer to your first question Kannan is, no. We -- first of all, as you're aware, we went through a fairly significant renegotiation cycle over the last 12 months, so those are all baked in the bag through the next three to five years depending on the nature of the particular content and I don't see any exposure in any of those agreements. I would suggest we're not going to continue to pay at the best part of the rate card given the size and the scale of our business as we move forward. I think frankly, what's more likely to happen in pay TV moving forward is what I talked about earlier, where I think there'll be some pruning and trimming of offers in the market. As folks move forward to manage their cost of goods sold on programming costs, it will be dropping or shifting away from less traffic networks. I think that's going to be a bigger driver of cost structure than renegotiation or anything around that. But we're pretty well baked in that regard. As you know, one of the things we're working through is, we have a step-up in our content cost as a result of that significant renegotiation work we did last year. We're going to have to work through that in 2020. And then in the subsequent years '21, '22, you'll see us on what I would call more industry traditional step-ups year-over-year in programming costs. But we're in the bag on those things and I think we're in pretty good shape. On the broadband attach rates, the attach rates in footprint where we offer broadband are extremely high and they haven't changed. We would expect to see a modest step-up as we move away from satellite combined with broadband and get into our software product distributed over broadband. Those sales rates, I think will help us on gross not necessarily a significant change in attach rates. When we are successful selling, we typically attach both. The reality is, is we want more gross. We don't necessarily want to change the attach rate. We get more gross by the fact that for example in footprint, solid 10% of those subscribers have line of sight related issues on satellite. They won't have that on the software-driven product. That helps us on gross intake and that's one of those things that help us -- helps us as we move through this year change those subscriber trends. Randall Stephenson : Okay. This is Randall. First of all, I just want to thank everybody for joining us again this morning for the call and your interest in AT&T. We're coming from off of 2019 where we told you exactly what we're going to do. And in terms of debt repayment, operational performance et cetera, capital allocation, we checked every box. We've now given you our playbook for 2020 through 2022. It's a playbook that we feel very confident that we can achieve. We're now gaining momentum in our wireless business, which we feel very good about that. We have a capital allocation plan that we have a high degree of confidence and we'll be able to execute over the next three years. And we have a media business that's performing at a very high level even in an industry that's in transition. And with HBO Max coming and the investment we're making there, we're confident that it's just another growth vehicle for this business over the next three years. So, bottom line, we have a plan that we think stacks up very nicely. We're confident in our ability to execute. We love the management team and look forward to 2020. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. John Stephens : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using AT&T teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Michael Viola : Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I am Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today are Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO; John Stankey, President and Chief Operating Officer for AT&T and John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer. Randall is going to begin with an overview of the COVID-19 impact on our employees, our customers and our business, John Stankey then will discuss how we are managing our business through this crisis, and then John Stephens is going to discuss COVID-19 financial impacts, how we are managing our liquidity and capital during this time and that\u2019s going to be followed by a brief look at first quarter results and then we will take your questions. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement which says that some of our comments maybe forward-looking. They are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are also available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. So with that, I will turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall? Randall Stephenson : Thanks, Mike and good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I want to start with a look at how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been chaotic few weeks for all of us, and the COVID pandemic had a significant impact to our first quarter to the tune of $0.05 per share. But if we set the COVID-19 impact aside for a moment, the first quarter was pretty much what we had expected. We expected to produce solid wireless results that would cover the HBO Max investment. The net result would be stable EBITDA and EBITDA margins, and that\u2019s exactly what we delivered. John Stephens will explain, the wireless EBITDA was up 7% for the quarter and that largely offset the significant investment we made in HBO Max. So, let\u2019s talk about how we are addressing the COVID-19 situation. We have about half of our employees working from home, and this ranges from our frontline customer support teams to our executives. For our folks who cannot work from home because they are on the frontlines providing essential services, we have instituted several policies to help keep them safe, everything from personal protection protocols and equipment to social distancing and additional cleaning, and we gave all our employees 4 weeks of additional paid excuse time off for a broad range of COVID-related needs. Turning to our customers, it all begins with the AT&T network, the best and fastest wireless network in the country. We are seeing unprecedented volumes of voice calls, text, video streaming, and our network is performing very well. And FirstNet is doing exactly what it was designed to do, provide critical connectivity to our first responders, healthcare providers, governments, military, police, fire, and EMS. The demand from our FirstNet customers has been tremendous. These first responders are the true heroes, and it\u2019s an honor to serve them. We understand that this crisis is putting unexpected financial pressure on many households and small businesses, so to give them some breathing room, we have adopted flexible payment options, waived late fees and overages, and we have lifted data caps. Connectivity is more essential now than ever and we want to do what we can to help our customers stay connected through this crisis. It\u2019s impossible to overstate the impact of COVID-19 on all of us. I expect it will have long-lasting implications for many things we used to take for granted like how we congregate, work, travel, and interact. The economic impact has been swift and there is no consensus on how long this downturn lasts. A lot hinges on when and how we open things back up, when do we have sufficient testing and protocols in place, so people feel comfortable returning to work or school or even going shopping. Bottom line, we have very little visibility into the broader economic situation, which makes it impractical to provide detailed financial guidance at this time. So here is what we\u2019ve done and what you can expect. As you know, we have suspended share retirements. We have a strong cash position, a strong balance sheet, and our core businesses are solid and generating good cash flow. We are sizing our operations to reflect the new economic activity level and we are leaning into our cost and efficiency initiatives. As a result, you should expect the following. We will continue investing in our critical growth areas like 5G, broadband, and HBO Max. We remain committed to our dividend. In fact, we finished last year with our dividend as a percent of free cash flow a little over 50%. And even with the current economic crisis, we expect the payout ratio in 2020 to be in the 60s, and we are targeting the low-end of that range, which is a very comfortable level for us. And last, we will continue to pay down debt and maintain high quality credit metrics. AT&T has been through a lot of other crises before. And each time, you have seen us emerge in a stronger position, and I am confident we will do it again with this one. So, with that, I am going to turn it over to John Stankey for an operational review. John? John Stankey : Thank you, Randall and good morning everyone. As Randall said, these are challenging times, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of how our employees have selflessly committed to doing everything they can to keep our society connected, informed, and entertained. For me, the highlights of what have been some pretty tough days are the wonderful stories of our employees on the frontline supporting healthcare professionals, enriching lives, and facilitating connections and commerce. This intrinsic tie to the essential functions of everyday life is why I am heartened by the fact in our core subscription-based businesses, wireless, broadband, and enterprise networks are critical and valued services in these times. They connect, inform, and entertain our customers. And for our business, they represent more than 60% of revenues and more than 70% of EBITDA. These businesses have proven to be resilient and they help provide a recurring stream of revenue and solid cash flows even in times of economic stress. They also provide a foundation that can absorb pressure from the other parts of the business that are facing headwinds because of COVID-19. In the media business, COVID has impacted us on the theatrical and TV side, with production studios and theater shutdown and less advertising revenues with the postponement or cancellation of sporting events. We also expect our pay TV business to be impacted by the economic headwinds. As you might expect, we\u2019re not backing off our cost and efficiency transformation initiatives that remain largely under our control. If anything, we see this as an opportunity to approach all our businesses differently and better align our work with how COVID has reshaped customer behaviors and the economy. As I shared previously, we are working on 10 broad areas of opportunities that we expect will deliver $6 billion in cost savings over the next three years and improve market effectiveness, everything from IT and field operations to call centers and retail distribution. Leaders and teams are in place to work the portfolio of opportunities. We have a solid senior governance structure to guide and resource this work. Since our last update, I\u2019d like to highlight two initiatives that are now underway to yield over $1 billion in recurring cost improvement and improve our overall customer experience. First is our retail and third-party distribution capabilities. To address our distribution strategy, we will be adjusting locations, location size, own versus agency mix, and point-of-sale support systems and compensation structures. The second initiative is focused on our field operations, which will benefit from our product evolution to customer self-install, the shift of our broadband base to lower-cost fiber, and improved systems and AI capabilities that will reduce truck rolls and eliminate second visits. These efficiencies will enhance our ability to continue to invest in our key growth initiatives. Our 5G deployment continues, although we continue to navigate workforce and permitting delays. We expect nationwide coverage this summer. We also continue to be opportunistic with our fiber build beyond the 14 million household locations we reach today. HBO Max continues to be a high priority, and we are set to launch May 27. We were right about the streaming model on HBO Max. Streaming that appeals to all demographics is in high demand. We have announced distribution agreements that cover nearly 50% of the HBO embedded wholesale base and over two-thirds of the retail base with more still to come prior to launch. Now, our technical teams are working to finish the platform that will offer one of the best customer experiences in streaming. We also have great new programs for nearly every key demo, such as Love Life with Anna Kendrick, The Not-Too-Late Show With Elmo, the unscripted voguing competition, Legendary, hosted by Dashaun Wesley, and much more. All this paired, with the day and date strength the award-winning HBO programming lineup and curated with one of the highest quality TV and film libraries available. The studios are dark for now, but as soon as we can resume production, we plan to get back where we left off in March with the steady stream of new offerings in the fall and winter. We are also deep into planning how priority operations will return to the workplace as we come out of this pandemic. This experience will change many things, including customer behaviors and expectations. We are evaluating our product distribution strategy, re-looking at volumes and the required support levels we need in a down economy. We\u2019re rethinking our theatrical model and looking for ways to accelerate efforts that are consistent with the rapid changes in consumer behavior from the pandemic. Yesterday\u2019s announcement that we will premiere Scoob! direct-to-home for viewing and purchase in the same window, followed by an exclusive streaming premiere on HBO Max is just one example. From an operations perspective, we weather the front-end of the storm. Now, our focus is on defining and leveraging the new normal across all of our operations. While our subscription model provides important stability in cash flow for us, we continue to work hard in all parts of the business to come out of this crisis stronger than before. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to John Stephens, who will provide the financial impacts of the COVID- 19. John? John Stephens : Thanks, John. Let\u2019s begin by walking through the expected financial impacts from this pandemic on Slide 5. With the uncertainty caused by COVID and the recovery, we have withdrawn all prior financial guidance. No one knows the full duration and magnitude of this situation. We have been running several different stress test scenarios with varying degrees of severity. Through it all, we expect to come through this healthy and expect that our cash flow will allow us to continue to invest in growth areas, to provide ample dividend coverage, and allow us to retire debt. We\u2019ll talk more about that in just a moment, but first there are some short-term and recurring financial impacts we want to discuss. In mobility, the most immediate impacts are the reduction of roaming revenues as well as a reduction in late fees. The waiving of late fees is a commitment to our customers during these difficult economic times and roaming should gradually increase as people start to travel more. The first quarter impact of these items was approximately $50 million, with virtually all of it in the second half of March. We are augmenting our digital sales team to mitigate the impact of store closures on equipment and service revenues, but we are still forecasting lower wireless gross adds and upgrades. In fact, equipment revenues were down nearly 25% year-over-year in March. As a result of COVID, we anticipate an increase in bad debt expense across the various businesses, and accordingly, have recorded a $250 million incremental reserve in anticipation of that. In our entertainment group, we anticipate increases in premium TV subscriber cord-cutting as well as lower revenues from commercial locations such as hotels, bars, and restaurants. Labor unit costs will increase temporarily from the 20% boost in pay we\u2019re providing our frontline employees. At WarnerMedia, content production has been placed on hiatus. Theatrical releases have been postponed and we\u2019re seeing lower advertising revenues and lower costs from sports rights. This crisis has shown the value of premium streaming entertainment and we anticipate strong demand for HBO Max when it launches next month. Fiber and broadband are more important than ever and we saw a pickup in demand for both in the quarter. We\u2019re also seeing higher demand for VPN bandwidth and security. We do expect a negative impact on small business, which makes up about 15% of our total business wire line revenues. A detailed schedule of the COVID impacts is included in our investor briefing. Now, let\u2019s walk through our first quarter highlights on Slide 7. Let\u2019s start with the financial summary. COVID impacted first quarter results, but we expect the full effect to be felt during the second quarter, assuming the U.S. economy and businesses begin to recover in the second half of 2020. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.84 a share, which includes about $0.05 of COVID impacts. We expect more than half of these impacts will be short-term in nature. Revenues were down from a year ago. COVID and FX had about a $900 million impact on revenues, mostly due to lower advertising from the cancellation of March Madness, as well as lower wireless equipment revenues. Much of this impact was offset by lower expenses. Strong growth in wireless service revenues were offset by reduced video revenues, tough year-over-year theatrical comparisons at Warner Bros., and reduced business and consumer legacy service revenues. At the same time, corresponding expense reductions generally offset the impacts on operating income. In fact, adjusted operating income margins declined by 20 basis points, but were up when excluding COVID impacts. Our ability to generate cash continues to provide a strong foundation for our capital allocation priorities. Cash from operations came in at $8.9 billion and free cash flow was about $4 billion. The first quarter is typically our lowest free cash flow quarter due to the timing of employee incentive compensation and vendor payments for holiday equipment sales. It also includes about $1 billion of working capital timing items that we expect to balance out later this year. We also saw COVID-related costs that impacted free cash flow. CapEx was nearly $5 billion, consistent with last year. Prior to the suspension of share repurchases, we retired about 142 million shares in the quarter and we retired about 200 million shares since the beginning of the fourth quarter last year. Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. The power of our core business continues to be crucial in these times, and we see the resiliency in our results. In Mobility, service revenue grew by 2.5% in the quarter. EBITDA of $7.8 billion grew by more than $500 million or 7%, and EBITDA margins expanded by 280 basis points. COVID did impact our top line revenue numbers in the quarter by about $200 million due to lower equipment and roaming revenues. Our subscriber counts for wireless, video and broadband this quarter exclude customers who we agreed not to terminate service for non-payment. For reporting purposes, we are treating those subscribers has disconnects. Even with that, our industry-leading network and FirstNet drove postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Postpaid phone churn was down 6 basis points to 0.86% and our 5G deployment continues. We now cover more than 120 million people in 190 markets, and we expect we\u2019ll be nationwide this summer. In our entertainment group, cash generation remains a focus. We added 209,000 AT&T Fiber subscribers and now serve more than 4 million. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up about 10% as we continue to focus on long-term value customers. We launched AT&T TV nationally late in the quarter and subscriber growth was in line with our expectations even with COVID impacts. Premium video net losses again improved sequentially. Business wireline performance was solid, with EBITDA and EBITDA margins remaining stable. Revenues were consistent with recent trends as declines in legacy products were partially offset by growth in strategic and managed services. Business wireline continued to be an effective channel for our mobility sales. Including wireless, total business revenues grew 1.7%. Now, let\u2019s move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. Coming into the quarter, we knew we had tough year-over-year theatrical comparisons and some continuing investment in HBO Max, and the sudden impact of COVID weighed on advertising, specifically around the cancellation of March Madness, and television and theatrical production delays. Altogether, COVID had about a $400 million revenue impact and a $250 million EBITDA impact on the quarter. And HBO Max is launching next month. Turning to our Latin American operations, Vrio continues to work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds, while Mexico continues to show solid EBITDA improvement. First quarter Mexico EBITDA improved $63 million year-over-year and we expect improvement to continue. And even in this economic environment, Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA. Now, let\u2019s go to Slide 10 and talk about how we are effectively managing our capital and liquidity. Even in this economic environment, the company has a strong cash position, a strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity. We plan for scenarios such as this. While none of us can predict exactly what is going to happen in the remainder of the year, we do know the work we have done over the last few years has put us in a strong position to deal with a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. We have reduced debt and restructuring of our debt towers, de-risked our pension plan assets and sold non-strategic assets. We expect free cash flow after dividends and cash on hand to more than cover our debt maturities this year and through 2023 even in this current economic environment. And we expect to be able to do that even if we choose not to access debt markets, while still investing in our key capital projects. We continue to take a prudent approach and we have a lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure. In April, we took on a $5.5 billion term loan agreement at competitive rates to provide additional flexibility and our revolver is in place like it always has been. We have a long history of not drawing on this facility and we have no plans to do it now, but this is a $15 billion facility, which provides us significant financial flexibility. Adding to our financial strength are proceeds from asset sales. We expect to close about $2 billion in sales from CME, real estate and tower monetizations this year and you should expect us to continue exploring other opportunities. We expect the sale of our Puerto Rico wireless operations to close in the second half of 2020. Our strong balance sheet allows us to remain focused on our capital allocation priorities and we remain committed to investing in growth opportunities for the business now and in the future, returning value to shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Mike, that\u2019s our presentation. We are now ready for the Q&A. Michael Viola : Operator, we are ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Randall, obviously given the size and breadth of the company, you guys have a unique perspective on what\u2019s going on in the broader economy. Can you give us a sense on some of the trends that you are seeing in April here? And then if you can dig a little bit deeper into AT&T, anything you can tell us about trends that you are seeing maybe in terms of wireless or maybe small business or advertising or those areas that might be affected by what\u2019s going on with the outbreak? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : Sure. Hi, John. Probably, I am not going to be able to give you any more insight to what we are all seeing, but look it\u2019s what we are seeing, and I would tell you the most disconcerting, troublesome area that we are seeing is what\u2019s happening down in small business. Now, we tend to under-index the small business, but the small business trends are pretty significant in terms of employee displacements, business closures, and that\u2019s the place that was going to drive, I think probably here in the next couple of months the unemployment issues more than anything and those are rather dramatic. On the \u2013 as you move up the stack on business, you are starting to see people obviously just like everybody else get really cautious in terms of how they are deploying capital spending. From our standpoint, we are seeing and you heard John Stephens mentioned this in his comments, from our standpoint, we are actually seeing businesses begin to step up bandwidth needs as you get into the medium and margin business, particularly around people working at home, consumers doing commerce from home, it\u2019s driving some significant bandwidth enhancement requirements and then we are seeing a lot of that. The consumer, obviously activity wise is really, really stagnant. There is no retail, and so the consumer is not out walking the streets and spending in retail, but you are seeing obviously the e-commerce trends pretty strong. And that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing, but in terms of just the activity whether it\u2019s traditional video, linear activity, or whether it\u2019s people going in and out of stores, wireless stores, it\u2019s just limited capability for customers to do that and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. But man, I tell you, what we are seeing is the volumes of network usage moving out of urban, out into suburban areas and the volumes have moved into the homes, and we are seeing heavy, heavy volume on the networks out in homes. This caused us to have to do some enhancement in a quick basis. Stankey and his team have been doing a lot of work to kind of make sure that the networks are being enhanced in areas where you haven\u2019t seen volumes like this. But man, the work volumes, the commerce volumes, the school, video streaming volumes have moved into the residential areas, and it\u2019s really impressive to watch, and it\u2019s impressive to see. While economic activity has slowed dramatically, it\u2019s impressive to see how much activity is still going on by virtue of the connectivity that\u2019s been facilitated into the homes. So, it\u2019s something obviously none of us have experienced before. But I would tell you, we as a company and I would even say we as an industry are taking a lot of satisfaction in terms of how these networks are standing up to the shift in volumes and the increase in volumes, and it should not be missed that this is no accident. The public policy positioning in the United States has been different than it has in most of the rest of the world. And as a result, the incentive to invest into building capacity and to have cushions of capacity for times like this are playing out, and I hope as we come out of this, our public policy folks will take a hard look at this and recognize that this is important, it\u2019s important for a society to have this type of capability and this type of capacity. And so John, why don\u2019t you talk about what you are seeing in general in the business? John Stankey : I would just offer two additional thoughts on that. I think as Randall indicated in the wireless space, clearly new switching and change activities suppressed, and it\u2019s largely being suppressed by distribution changes out in the environment. Engagement of the product is not suppressed. Engagement remains incredibly high. And as a result of that, some of the dynamics of customers choosing to go up the continuum of higher priced service plans to accommodate their increased usage is in fact manifested itself and that\u2019s consistent with one of the expectations that we had in our plans this year as we moved through the year, probably offering the advertising space that it\u2019s going to be soft and it\u2019s probably two reasons behind that. One as you know, there is no sports content, one of the best yielding pieces of inventory that we have access to. And so with that, we are moving from the portfolio you are going to see pressure as a result of that. And then secondly, economic activity is down. We have complete segments that have come out of the advertising space. Obviously travel, there is suppression on what\u2019s going on in automobile, hospitality, and lodging. So, as that occurs the scatter market is not as robust as it\u2019s been. I don\u2019t know what the second quarter will bring at the end. Certainly ratings are still there. They are stronger than probably expected, but it\u2019s a demand issue given the economic activity. So, as economic activity goes, I expect we will see that move back one way or the other, and then the theatrical business is obviously a stressed business right now, and theaters are closed. It\u2019s hard to generate revenue, and don\u2019t expect that, that\u2019s going to be a snapback. I think that\u2019s going to be something that we are going to have to watch the formation of consumer confidence, not just about going to movies just in general about being back out public and understanding what\u2019s occurring there. John Stephens : John, if I could, let me just give you a quick view, commercial paper markets, bond markets, asset financing markets and as we have shown bank term loan markets are all open. There was some rockiness there as we went through March, not for us, but for the overall markets. We always had access, but what we are seeing today is the federal stimulus and the federal reserves action really starting to work its way to the system and things getting back to what I would consider more normal state. But I will say those markets are open for us and working and we are getting to make choices on what\u2019s the most efficient, most flexibility in those financing needs that we have. So from that time of the house, I think it\u2019s a pretty good story, it\u2019s been interesting few months, but it\u2019s the policy changes that were made I think are having a positive effect. Randall Stephenson : Hats off to the Fed. I would have to give good marks for how they have managed through this to making sure the capital markets have been able to function. Michael Viola : Thanks, John. We will take our next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. Two if I can. First on video, you mentioned faster cord-cutting and commercial issues, what are you seeing so far in April and as well as AT&T TV nano trends? And then second, you mentioned some of the financial markets, what does the asset sale picture look like for you now and working capital was a drag in the first quarter versus a year ago, what has to happen to reverse this? Thank you. Randall Stephenson : So Phil, on the first part actually where we stand right now is there has really been no acceleration or change in trends. If anything, it slowed down a little bit as people are engaging more with product and clearly at home having more time gaining more utility out of it. However, we are expecting that there is going to be a stressed economic environment in the second half of this year at some point and one would conclude that in a stressed economic environment, there probably are going to be adjustments that people make within their lifestyle and their home. So I would expect that we may see more pressure on that as we move through the year, but we don\u2019t know but would expect that, that\u2019s going to be case. It hasn\u2019t manifested itself right now in terms of decisions to remove. As I said earlier on the wireless side inbound activity, new add activity suppressed right now, you can well imagine with the circumstances around people\u2019s homes and entry and the dynamics that are going on, there is just a lower gross activity that\u2019s occurring in the industry. I don\u2019t feel too bad about where we are in that mix, because with the AT&T TV product as you asked about, that\u2019s a great product to have in this situation. It\u2019s a low touch product, oftentimes customers self install. And so it matches up well to that environment. But there just is a certain amount of economic activity that\u2019s been suppressed there. Our expectations on AT&T TV have been very consistent with what we have seen even with the suppression of the pandemic in the latter part of March where we were restricted on the certain number of dispatches and some of our capacity there. So, we feel pretty good about that launch and where we went. As you know, we have to ramp that throughout the year, so one month is not a year make, but we are right on the plan of what we expected in terms of volume and the customer feedback on the customers we have put on the product has been probably stronger than what we expected. So, it\u2019s clearly showing that the product is closing some of the gaps that we know the satellite product was a little bit soft on and we feel really good about that. John Stephens : So with regard to the asset sales, to your two buckets, one, the sale of CME that our European media company is on track, that\u2019s about a $1.1 billion in proceeds, debt relief about $600 million. We expect that to close in the second half of the year just going through the normal EU regulatory review. We also have in that bucket some other towers, some remaining towers that we are selling under contract and some remaining real estate we would expect those to get closed in the second half of the year. So we are thinking about that, it\u2019s about $2 billion cash plus the relief of debt of $600 million. That\u2019s one set. The second piece is the Puerto Rico wireless operations that process is continuing to go through as a normal federal review process regulatory we expect that to close in the second half of the year. And in both, in all cases, the buyers have the financial resources to close the deal. We have earmarked those funds already. So we want to make sure the flexibility for those. We already decided what we are going to do with those funds with regards to reducing some preferred partnership interest. Lastly, I will tell you that we are looking at other real estate, other \u2013 evaluating other transactions, there is some slowdown, but as I mentioned before, there still is availability of funds out there. So we are continuing to work through it and don\u2019t have anything additional to announce, but we are continuing to work through it. With regard to the working capital, we had the impact of COVID on the first quarters working capital only about a $1 billion of what I call timing items that will bounce out in the rest of the year so the one point I think I'd make to you is, if you look back the last 5 years of first quarter free cash flow this is the second highest we have ever had last year was a stellar performance because we had some securitization of receivables and so forth we continue to be able to do that but we haven\u2019t we didn\u2019t add to that balance this year as much as we had in the past so as such is a comparison that is differentiated but I to point out that the expectations or the results we had were expected other than COVID and that we expect that to balance out so the cash flow numbers still feel pretty good when you take into account this challenging environment. Michael Viola : Thanks, Phil. We will take our next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about capital spending. We just saw Rogers in Canada say year-on-year CapEx will be well below prior guidance I understand you are not giving guidance but what\u2019s your ability to spend as you were planning to previously, given any kind of. restrictions from COVID-19 or maybe fewer housing starts, etcetera so is it likely that may be the run rate in the rest of the year will be a little bit below prior trends or prior expectations and then on the online channels where are you on your kind of proportion of wireless gross adds upgrades that can come through the online channel where do you see that going and maybe the same for broadband? Thanks. Randall Stephenson : So let me first take the capital issue we go through is we regularly do a real scrub of the process. John \u2013 we are working with John\u2019s team, the operations folks. We are constantly going through that. The message we really we want to give to you right now is that we can continue to invest and continue to paying out our debt and continue to pay our dividend all in a very flexible environment, in this. So while we are going or we are going to scrub capital very, very significantly like we always do or we or not we are not announcing any kind of levels today with that being said the critical things that we had going is the completion of the FirstNet build. And we are staying committed to that we have talked about 5G being nationwide this summer so there are such things that we are committed to the stay committed to so it will be revolving story but we feel really good about the financial capabilities to continue to invest and quite frankly the unknown might be is when we come out this what will be the new things we want to invest in that will benefit consumers, that will benefit our shareholders and will retain their flexibility alright John take care of the to respond to kind of the online channels and that question. John Stankey : Yes. Simon, I would say that it\u2019s a can versus want. I mean, we can do virtually everything online. It\u2019s what the consumer wants to do that is more of a question and to add to this point of time are to the pandemic consumers wanted to spend more time in retail stores as a percentage of total gross or adds than they did online it does not mean we didn\u2019t do online volumes and that there are period of time like when a major device comes out that number spikes to a pretty high percentage of mix often times customers just had this desire that they wanted to come in and touch and feel the device and compare it to look at it pick up a couple other items all they were there that was the most convenient way for them to do it I would fully expect that is retail capacity may be diminishes and spokes start to think differently about the behaviors more broadly that we are going to see people start to experiment to use all the great tools that we have out there and all the abilities to actually complete a transaction online and I would tell you I think that in a mixed environment where our customer does a combination of acquiring the device online and then fulfilling they were in a great position because I think you are probably aware of where we have been doing a fair amount in market with concierge services where we have been partnering with third-parties to actually deliver the handset into the home free setup to work with the individual we have doctored those processes to actually make them cleaner and less contact associated with them to make customers more comfortable about that kind of an approach we have been moving some of our employees into the mode of being able to do that we have been shifting stores the curb side pickup where our customer can order online and then drive through store location and pick it up at the curb in a sanitized bag to get it. So, I think we are prepared to adjust to whatever the customer chooses to do after they decide that they no longer want to suppress buying a handset and they need to go out and do something if traditional retail channels are unavailable. Randall Stephenson : But before you go off that and Stankey you may want to follow-up on this, but Simon, back to the issue on the capital spending, the issue that John Stankey and his team are running into right now is obviously in our industry is you know better than anybody, it\u2019s not just writing checks for CapEx. It\u2019s people out doing things and it\u2019s particularly in terms of new sell-side acquisition which we are doing a lot for FirstNet and enhancing density. These require permitting and government officials and government officials are sheltered in place and a lot of the permitting and a lot of the logistics to go into allowing us to invest are a little bit hampered right now. And so while we have no intention of slowing down on 5G and fiber deployment and such, reality is that a lot of it is not in our control. We are having to work through some of those issues. So, there is probably going to be relatively to what the targets we gave you on the CapEx of downward proclivity on that number, just because of logistical issues that we are running into. Michael Viola : Simon thanks for the questions. We take the question, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks and good morning. Can you unpack how you consider the credit risk across the different operating segments and can you share with us some of the historical experiences you may have looked to try to estimate the potential impacts? Randall Stephenson : Sure. Good morning to you, Mike and let me answer the question. First and foremost, the issues with regard to the accounting side in the simplest sense, is out of the existing new rules that we can look forward in the bad debt risk as opposed to just relying on history. So, that\u2019s what we are doing with regard to recording the $250 million. What we have looked at is for example, in the WarnerMedia business, we look at the theater owners that are out there, but still they have some payables to us or we have receivables from them and we went in and said in this environment what is our estimate of collections, right. On the wireless business, on a month to month business so to speak with whether it be prepaid or whether it be services there is much more knowledge and much more information on that when you look to theirs on the equipment sales and on the next receivables financing. And we take into account what we think is a percentage of those based on their payment history, but based on this new environmental situation, what we think that might be done. So, we broke it down into, so to speak, that category. Conditioning on a going forward basis, we have been accruing up and outside of that 250 accruing up all those, I think there is about, for example, 40,000 postpaid voice customers that we are still providing the service to, but that we did \u2013 we counted as disconnects in our numbers. They are not in the 163. We are continuing to reserve those. But we effectively went through that kind of process that I just laid out a mobility that I laid out in more immediate and we continue that throughout the process. And so we are going to continue to update that, be careful with that, but we believe we are, if you will, current and got everything from today\u2019s receivables and the impact COVID will have on those as we collect them into the future. Michael Viola : Thanks. Thanks for the question, Mike. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and I hope you guys are all doing okay. I guess, doing the math on Randall\u2019s comments at the beginning of kind of a low 60% payout ratio, it implies that the new free cash flow guidance for 2020 is between $23 billion and $25 billion. John, I was wondering if you could \u2013 John Stephens, I was wondering if you could maybe bridge us between the $28 million that you thought the free cash flow would be and where that $23 billion to $25 billion lands us? And then the second kind of related question would be I think that there is specific question about some of the more exotic kind of financial market liquidity situations, for instance, last year you did a significant media receivable financing? Is the market open to refinance that, to roll that? What is the market for equipment receivables look like, is it liquid, is it affordable? If you could kind of walk us through some of those situations will be very helpful? Thank you. Randall Stephenson : Let me start and then I\u2019ll hand it to John Stephens here to address, particularly the financial instruments, but also just the free cash flow number that you backed into. We\u2019re sitting here over the last couple of weeks trying to get our arms around where this economic situation can go and we bring in the smartest and most genius economists in the world and you can bring a dozen of them in and the range of possible outcomes just for the second quarter of 2020 is unbelievably wide. And then you begin to push that out for what the full year 2020 looks like, and it remains as wide. And so, trying to discern where you think the economic scenario lands for this year is proving to be pretty difficult right now. And so, as we begin to formulate our actions and look, we \u2013 this team here has been through a number of these events. We\u2019ve been through 9/11, this team has been through the financial crisis, now we\u2019re going through COVID-19, and one thing we really like to do is just \u2013 let\u2019s just short things up when you have this kind of uncertainty, suspend the share buyback program just to ensure that we have good solid foundation in cash position as we migrate through this. Where can this thing go and what are the implications to our free cash flow numbers this year is a wide range, David. And we\u2019ve given you a number that we feel very comfortable that we can hit this year, that payout ratio in the 60\u2019s, but our scenarios of possible outcomes are pretty wide. But we think what we\u2019ve done is given ourselves a target that we feel comfortable in terms of meeting. And so, there are, as, in these businesses \u2013 you follow these businesses a long time, David, there are a lot of levers to pull that are underpinning the free cash flow number and what happens with capital spending and what can you do on working capital, and John is going to talk to you about working capitals and some of our ability to finance some of the receivables and so forth, but bottom line what we\u2019ve given you in that 60\u2019s kind of range of free cash flow payout, the dividend as a percent of free cash flow, it\u2019s a number we feel fairly very, very comfortable we can achieve. Okay? So John, do you want to add anything to that and then talk about... John Stephens : Yes. So, first of all, David, the market is open to us in all forms. The terms aren\u2019t exactly the same as they were, all those kinds of things, they change and they continue to change as we\u2019re going through the year, but they\u2019re very open. If you look at what our bonds are trading at today, they\u2019re a little bit higher, 15 basis points, 20 basis points higher than they were in mid-February, but they\u2019re dramatically off some of the challenging days of mid-March and the end of March. So, my point is, the financial markets are open to us, including asset-based financing next receivables, accounts receivable securitizations. With that being said, as we mentioned in our call, equipment sales are down. So the level we\u2019re going to do with that is down. Equipment sales are going to be down, so the demand on the financial markets to pick those assets up is down. So, quite frankly, it\u2019s a situation where with demand being down, there may be more flexibility in getting it, maybe \u2013 I\u2019m not suggesting there, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s part of that overall discussion. But we certainly \u2013 and we took advantage and we participated in those markets throughout the first quarter and in March, as we often \u2013 as we usually do. So there has been \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any limitation there. And, as I said, we\u2019re seeing the markets even become what I would \u2013 move back toward more operational, more normal operational activity as we get through April, and we \u2013 as Randall said, we applaud the Fed\u2019s efforts and the congressional efforts. Secondly, what I go to is, when I think about free cash flows, I have taken into account a couple of things that we haven\u2019t talked about. I don\u2019t know what the stimulus bill is going to do with regard to whether it\u2019s the PPP loans, the continue to pay your employee loans that a lot of our customers get, whether it\u2019s the unemployment checks that are going out in just record amounts and what will that do to the collections we have with regard to these really great resilient products like wireless and connectivity. You got to take into account whether the deferral of payroll taxes for a company like ours with 250,000 domestic employees, the ability to defer those payroll taxes into 2021 and 2022, not only on a Fed basis, but many states is really pretty important. Whether the other aspects out there are going to provide us some assistance or provide us some pressure, we are going through that. With regard to the businesses themselves, WarnerMedia as John Stankey said earlier, we talked about the theatrical and the advertising piece of those business, we have to go through that. Quite frankly, you can understand when you take production goes on hiatus, we are paying our people and making sure they are personally taken care of, but a lot of the other costs that are cash outlays go away during that time. And so there is a balance there. Business, we did see some businesses trying to extend their terms, weeks, days and weeks and we are working through that, but we are continuing to get paid. And so it\u2019s just working through that, but this ability on mobility, which is quite frankly the big engine to deal with the service revenues and collect those gives me great confidence that we have something to build off of and something to rely on. And when you add broadband, when you add business services, quite frankly, we are seeing some really reliability in some of our entertainment products feel good about our ability to manage through this. We are leaving ourselves lot of flexibility as Randall said, because there is a wide rage of opinions as to what\u2019s going to happen and we are just working through all the different alternatives. The variance is off that base case. Michael Viola : Okay. Thanks, David. We will take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess John Stephens, the partial quarter impacts you are seeing from COVID, is it fair to try to quarterize those things and get a forward look at the 2Q or is there some front-end load in there that we should be thinking about? And then I guess on the competitive side for wireless, what do you guys think is going to happen over the next, call it 3, 4, 5 months given the fact that you have the new T-Mobile out there, but obviously this virus overhead, but should we expect a continued sort of dampening of the competitive landscape as we go through this? Thanks. John Stephens : So on the COVID items and I think there is some information we have made public in our IB, Mike. But I\u2019d point out this on the bad debt so to speak reserve what do you \u2013 what I would expect to see is that is a one-time item for this quarter that is so to speak putting us all on part at the end of the quarter and will include changes in our reserve rates just on a run-rate basis going forward. Now, we are watching closely now, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest necessarily that\u2019s gong to be a recurring item. There maybe higher bad debts. I don\u2019t mean to say there won\u2019t be. But as I said too, we have really got to figure out what happens with the stimulus funds that are going out and how that affects our collectibility and so forth. But I would expect to do with that. On our, what we call, our compassion pay, that will go on in some of the, if you will, bonus pay for some of our technicians. That will go on into the second quarter, I don\u2019t know, I think John Stankey and his team are going to have to make decisions on how long it goes. I think they are going to evaluate that with regard to the current economic conditions and the state by state kind of impacts and shelter in place and so forth, but that could continue. The production disruption costs quite frankly could continue. We will see through that. But as I mentioned before, that\u2019s an unusual and it may have a different cash flow impact. So that\u2019s how I think about those things. As I mentioned, we had about 40,000 postpaid voice customers that we have counted as disconnects that we are actually still providing service, that number will grow as we go through time, but it will get to a peak as we go through this process. So it\u2019s very manageable approach. We have, what I will call, similar numbers in video and broadband, but they are \u2013 at this time within our base of customers, I think we are in a manageable state. Let me hand it off to John to talk about to answer your other question, Mike? Mike McCormack : I am sorry, on the equipment revenue side, down 25%, is that a decent proxy as you think about 2Q? John Stephens : Yes. Let me answer. We just want to give you and John could comment is we just want to give you a factoid on something that actually happened, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 if the shelter in place orders stay in place and retail stays closed, certainly you could have a significant reduction. As you know, that reduction in revenues also comes with significant reduction in expense and so customers can really streamline their billing relationship with us without necessarily impacting our profitability. So, we will see how that goes. I am not giving an answer Mike for the specific purpose of, it\u2019s too unpredictable, but yes, we intended to give you that information about the 25% reduction in March. John, I\u2019ll let you comment on anything else? John Stankey : Yes, I would echo, Mike, but I think to your point on what happens over the next quarter or so, it\u2019s I would bet on suppressed activity. I think it\u2019s over the next quarter suppressed because of inability for people to be out and about doing things and being restricted and still given the nature of this purchase maybe wanting to have a little bit more of physical experience at times. I would then suspect that as we get the latter part of the year, you look at discretionary decisions like do I get the handset and a stressed economic environment, I think that discretionary decision on the purchase of the next handset maybe has a little bit of suppression on it as a result of that, not use of the service. Service is indispensable, but the choice to possibly get that next handset and maybe defer it given that\u2019s an outlay in a household that is trying to make some decisions on discretionary income is likely to have a downward bias on it. In terms of the plays we run, our plays remain the same. The strength that Randall talked about in how the networks performing in this moment in time is testament to what we have put in place with the massive increase of capacity and performance that we have been working on through the combination of the FirstNet deployment in deploying our spectrum inventory all at the same time and you are seeing just the strength of the network and how it\u2019s performing right now on our net promoter score results from our customers and their impressions of the network are improving every month right now. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us that solid momentum you are seeing in customer acquisition and I expect that as people continue to use the network more aggressively for their indispensable work day in and day out that we are going to see that impression continue to improve and move in the right direction. We are going to add to that a boost of adrenaline with the HBO Max promotion that you saw just started yesterday. We are going to start get pretty loud in the market with that. So, the combination of growing the HBO Max subscription base plus it\u2019s tied to promotion with a lot of our wireless products and services, I think is going to drive up awareness and there are some great opportunities that pair tablets and devices together and see great entertainment with it and get good values on that. That will be helpful. Our 5G deployment as we said we are going to be out in the summer where we have nationwide coverage and that will further improve and also allow for a marketing position that I think would be helpful. And then we are going great guns on FirstNet and you look at the volumes of what\u2019s occurred in the last couple of weeks in the first responder community and some of the awareness that\u2019s been building around what the offering is on that product and service and the awareness that\u2019s driving it, we are going to get tailwinds from that as well and continued great performance. We are now over 1.3 million devices connected to that network and we are seeing that pace accelerate over the last several weeks. And so not that I am enamored with the pandemic, but it has helped that product category and the awareness of that product category. So, we are going to run our plays and we are going to be in a good position, because the plays we have set up are built on the strength that we have been working on over the last couple of years to put in place. Michael Viola : Mike thanks for your questions. Greg, we will take one last question. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yes, thanks and I will like to follow-up just on that question about wireless sales, with equipment sales being down, is that a good way of thinking about how much activity is down meaning you noted gross adds are down, are they down about the same amount or a disconnects down about the same amount? And the reason I ask is that you know there is a variable cost associated with all these customer transactions and so the real question is, is there indeed a cost buffer you are getting as a result of that lower activity level and are you finding that it is sufficient to offset or nearly offset some of the commitments you have made to your customers by giving them more flexible payment terms and some of the commitments you have made to your employees through the compassion pay? And ultimately are you comfortable that the durability of your EBITDA stream and wireless is going to playing out the multiple scenarios here? John Stephens : Hey, Brett. This is John. Let me take the first numbers question and hand off to John Stankey for the business question real quick. Think about it this way, our service revenues are up about $350 million. Our EBITDA was up $500 million. So, we are getting cost savings throughout the operations. I mean, the math works that way. And that\u2019s with the inclusion in those numbers of the COVID impact. So whether that\u2019s the bad debt piece that went to mobility, whether that\u2019s the loss of international roaming, whether that\u2019s the changes in late payment fees, all of that is included. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 that $0.05 of COVID is in our numbers and so I\u2019d just say to you that I think it answers that question directly that if your service revenues went up $300 million, $350 million and your profitability went up $500 million, we\u2019re clearly getting efficiencies from a lot of the efforts that\u2019s been going on from quarters and quarters, but also from the impact of how we\u2019re managing the business. John? John Stankey : Yes, I would \u2013 just to build on what John said, our service revenues are not increasing just in one single category they are improving across the board in postpaid. ARPUs are up in postpaid, ARPUs are up in prepaid. We\u2019re seeing improvements in our connected devices categories. So service revenues are strong across the board. And I would just say structurally, Brett, if we step back and think about this from a macro perspective, in an environment where gross add activity is suppressed and churn is going down, that\u2019s not a bad economic construct for our business. I mean, that\u2019s a \u2013 when customers continue to pay their bills and I think by and large what we\u2019ve seen in past economic stress, the last thing that people don\u2019t want to pay is probably their cell phone bill. And so \u2013 and we feel pretty good about what\u2019s going to go on there and the suppressed activity is suppressed activity, but we got a great base and an important product and with the network performance getting better and better, that churn number has been hanging in there and getting a little bit better, I think we feel good about it all the way around. Brett Feldman : Okay, very good. Michael Viola : Thanks, Brett. John Stephens : Thanks, Brett. And everybody stay safe. Randall Stephenson : And let me just close by the question centered around what are you expecting? And as we said at the very beginning, we\u2019re in a world where there is very little visibility in terms of what the general economic environment is going to be? When is America going to go back to work? That\u2019s going to roll out probably by community, it\u2019s probably going to be slower than most of us like. What kind of effect does this government stimulus is going to have on economic activity? How the unemployment benefits going to play into this? So just a lot of unknowns in terms of what\u2019s going to play out over the next few quarters and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been a bit defensive in terms of how we positioned AT&T. We have a good cash position. As you heard John Stephens say, we have ready access to the capital markets. And as you heard John Stankey talk about, the resiliency of these products is really, really impressive, it\u2019s really good. And so, we were pleased with how we were able to navigate this early on, it\u2019s very early, but we\u2019re going to continue to invest. You should feel comfortable with the dividend. We\u2019re going to continue to be committed to that dividend and you should see our debt levels come down as we move through the course of this year and we\u2019ll just keep you posted as we work through the balance of this year. So, thank you again for joining us and we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m Amir Rozwadowski, head of Investor Relations for AT&T.  Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, AT&T\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer. John will provide opening comments followed by John Stephens covering second quarter results and our liquidity and capital position. After that, John Stankey will come back with a business transformation update and discuss the HBO Max launch, then we\u2019ll take your questions. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. As always, our earnings materials are also available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website.  I also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the NCC spectrum auction 105, so we cannot address any questions about that today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks Amir. I\u2019m delighted to have you on board. You delivered that Safe Harbor statement much better than Mike Viola ever did. But seriously, we appreciate the great job Mike did leading our IR team for many years and working side-by-side with him. I\u2019m going to miss seeing him around and wish he and his family all the best in their retirement. Good morning everyone. I hope you\u2019re all doing well as we continue to live with the impacts of COVID-19, which I expect are going to be with us for some time. We\u2019re planning and operating under the assumption that significant accommodations for COVID will be the business norm well into next year.  The unfortunate reality simply sharpens our focus and strengthens our resolve on the business transformation path we\u2019ve chartered and the investment focus we\u2019ve adopted. Given that, let me walk you through our priorities moving forward.  As a company, our purpose is to create connection. We create connection with each other, with what people and businesses need to thrive every day, and with stories and experiences that matter. That purpose leads us to our market focus. First, as a broadband provider, our high speed fiber and wireless broadband networks connect the people and businesses that form the foundation for how we live and work. Second, as a software-based entertainment provider, we deliver compelling entertainment experiences through HBO Max and ATT TV, giving us the opportunity to establish meaningful relationships with the majority of U.S. households. Third, the fantastic stories we tell and share on our platforms drive direct customer engagement and insights and create emotional attachments that can drive long lasting customer loyalty across our product set. We\u2019re executing our plans to provide great connectivity and great content along with better value and service to drive more customer engagement across all of AT&T. Our goal is to give our customers a reason to actively engage with us every day, in fact multiple times a day. Every touch point represents a chance to learn more about what they want, and bringing connectivity and engagement together will allow for the crucial insights to guide future investment and open new opportunities for subscription and advertising supported products.  That\u2019s our set-up, and that\u2019s the way you\u2019ll hear us talking about things going forward. To grow, we know we have to be more effective and efficient in our execution. As part of our transformation initiative, we have more than 50 different work streams underway that will enhance not only how we work together but how we deliver improved service levels and greater value for our customers, including competitive pricing that drives market momentum and targeted investment to achieve growth in those key products I mentioned. Our success relies on AT&T becoming a more agile and efficient company that\u2019s able to meet our customers\u2019 needs in highly competitive and quickly evolving markets.  Our transformation began with the new operating model we put in place at WarnerMedia last year to organize our teams around entertainment networks, live programming, content production, and affiliate and advertising sales. That allowed us to work together across WarnerMedia and all of AT&T to successfully launch HBO Max. A few months ago, we took the next step and moved Xandr to WarnerMedia so we could accelerate our progress in building software-based entertainment platforms supported by both subscription and advertising, like the AVOD version of HBO Max we plan to launch next year. Last month, we made changes on how we\u2019re organized and operate at AT&T Communications to improve our focus on customer service, simplify and rationalize our product portfolio around our growth areas, and operate with more speed and efficiency. I fully expect that the AT&T that emerges from this transformation work will look different than what we know today. We couldn\u2019t make this transition without a solid balance sheet and a deliberate capital allocation plan. We have strong cash flows that allow us to allocate capital effectively. We\u2019re continuing to invest significantly in our growth areas of fiber, 5G which is nationwide as of today, FirstNet and HBO Max. We remain committed to our dividend, which we\u2019ve increased by 36 consecutive years. We finished the quarter with a dividend payout ratio of about 50%. We expect to end the year with our payout ratio in the 60s, likely at the low end of that range.  We continue to reduce our near term debt obligations and maintain high quality debt metrics. Finally, we remain committed to an ongoing disciplined review of our portfolio of businesses and assets to identify those we can monetize because they\u2019re no longer core to our business. Now let me offer my perspective on the quarter before I turn it over to John Stephens to walk you through the details.  Our core subscription businesses proved to be resilient in the face of the economic downturn. Our mobility and business wire line segments performed well, and we grew EBITDA margins in both areas. We continued to add new fiber customers though COVID limited our ability to go into some customers\u2019 homes for installs. Our software-based entertainment businesses performed well. ATT TV subscriber growth in its first full quarter was better than we expected and it\u2019s our highest performing video product o customer satisfaction, double the level of our legacy TV services. HBO Max had a strong launch, on track to hit its targets we laid out for you last fall. We\u2019re already seeing how HBO Max can increase our broadband adds and increase wireless ARPU.  Obviously COVID had a significant impact on our WarnerMedia segment with advertising revenues, content production, and theaters all shut down. We\u2019ll talk more about that a little later in the presentation, but I cannot imagine being at this moment absent the moves we made last year to reconfigure our WarnerMedia operations and refocus the business on the growing and important direct-to-consumer opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John. John Stephens : Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Our financial summary for the quarter begins on Slide 5. Adjusted EPS was $0.83 a share. That included COVID impacts from incremental costs related to compassion pay and production delays and lost revenues from foregone international roaming and delayed theatrical releases. Combined, COVID had a $0.09 a share impact to second quarter EPS. Adjustments for the quarter include an overall accrual for severance and a non-cash write-down of real goodwill based on the overall economic conditions in Latin America, foreign exchange rates, and COVID impacts. The severance accrual reflects the workforce adjustments we\u2019re making as part of our cost reduction and transformation plans. Cash impacts from these severances will occur over the next several quarters. Revenues were down from a year ago, including an estimated $2.8 billion of lost or deferred revenues impact from COVID. This was mostly due to the absence of theatrical and television releases and lower advertising from delayed sports programming and a slow economy. Lower international roaming revenues impacted mobility. In our reported results, foreign exchange had an impact of about $500 million in lower revenues, primarily in our Latin America segment. Corresponding expense reductions offset most of the impact on operating income. In fact, adjusted operating income margins were essentially flat but were up when excluding COVID impacts. Cash flow was impressive even during the pandemic. Cash from operations came in at more than $12 billion and free cash flow came in at $7.6 billion. A variety of items supported cash, including solid accounts receivable collections and some benefits from the CARES Act, and we continue to invest in our growth areas. Capex was $4.5 billion with gross capital investment at around $5 billion, a difference primarily attributable to the timing of vendor payments, plus we invested an additional $1 billion in new 5G spectrum in the quarter and we invested nearly $4 million in HBO Max, in line with our full year estimate of $2 billion. We were active in the debt markets during the quarter, managing our towers for financial flexibility and allowing us to take advantage of historically low interest rates. We\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. Let\u2019s look at our segment operating results, starting with our communications segment on Slide 6. Our subscription business led by mobility, broadband and business wire line, remained resilient. Mobility had another good quarter, even with the impact of COVID. Equipment revenue helped to offset declines in service revenues, which were down due to a decline in international roaming revenue and waived overage and late fees. Without those COVID impacts, we estimate service revenue would have grown more than 2%. Even with many of our stores being closed during much of the quarter, mobility equipment revenues grew with growth in digital sales and a strong rebound as stores reopened late in the quarter.  Mobility EBITDA continues to be a solid story. EBITDA of $7.8 billion was up year-over-year with both EBITDA margins and service margins expanding, and that\u2019s inclusive of COVID impacts.  Our total reported phone growth was essentially flat. We had more than 135,000 prepaid phone net adds that helped offset a decline in postpaid phone. Our quarterly subscriber counts for the postpaid wireless, video and broadband reflect an estimate for customers who will likely disconnect service once the Keep America Connected pledge ends. In short, we\u2019re treating these subscribers as disconnects in the second quarter. While this impacts net adds, churn and service revenues, we believe this is the most transparent and accurate way to account for this. About 340,000 of our postpaid phone subscribers were counted as disconnects, even though they were still on our network. If you add those back to our results, we would have had about 190,000 postpaid phone net adds and much lower churn. Postpaid phone churn was down 2 basis points even with the Keep America Connected accrual. We also had a record low prepaid churn of under 3%. The popularity of our unlimited plans also increased thanks in part to our elite package that includes HBO Max.  In our entertainment group, we had lower video and advertising revenues. This includes an estimated $300 million impact on both revenue and EBITDA from COVID from lower advertising demand and lower commercial volumes. AT&T TV gains helped offset premium video losses and at the same time had about a 90% attach rate with our broadband services. Premium video losses remained about the same as the first quarter. Broadband customers continue to look for faster speeds. We added more than 220,000 AT&T Fiber subscribers and the number of customers opting for gigabit speeds increased by more than 750,000 in the quarter. We now have 4.3 million AT&T Fiber customers with nearly 2 million of them on one gigabit speeds. I should point out our total broadband numbers do not include 159,000 subscribers who are counted as disconnects even though they remained active on our network through the Keep America Connected program.  We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 6% as we continue to focus on long-term value customers. Business wire line performance was solid as enterprise customers trusted the reliability and flexibility of our network. EBITDA was essentially stable year-over-year and margins expanded by 90 basis points. Revenues were consistent with recent trends as slower declines in legacy products were partially offset by growth in strategic and managed services. This EBITDA strength was even more impressive when you consider that a year ago, we had an IP sale which helped both revenue and EBITDA results. If you back that out, revenue would have been down just 1.7% and EBITDA would have grown. Let\u2019s move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 7. As John mentioned, the COVID impact is most evident in our WarnerMedia results. Altogether, COVID had about a $1.5 billion revenue impact on the quarter. Lower expenses resulted in a favorable impact on EBITDA. The biggest news in the quarter from WarnerMedia was the successful launch of HBO Max, which John will cover in more detail in just a minute. Turning to our Latin America operations, foreign exchange was a major factor as were slow economies and the onset of COVID. Mexico was impacted by lower equipment sales from COVID-related store closures. This also impacted prepaid customers\u2019 ability to renew their service. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year over year. Rio also continues to work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds which have become even stiffer with COVID, but even in this challenging economic environment, Rio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. We closed our Venezuela operations in the quarter to comply with sanctions of U.S. laws. This had minimal impact on Rio\u2019s financial results but did reduce its subscriber base.  Now let\u2019s go to Slide 8 for an update on capital structure.  We exited the quarter with a very strong financial position. Cash flows were strong, our capital allocation remained focused, and we made large strides in effectively managing our debt portfolio. Our strong free cash flow in the quarter gives us even greater confidence that we\u2019ll hit our full-year goal of a total dividend payout ratio in the 60% range, likely at the low end of that range.  We also continue to invest. We now expect gross capital investment to come in at the $20 billion range for the full year, consistent with our original 2020 guidance. The FirstNet build continues to run ahead of plan. We expect additional network benefits as our 5G build is expected to reach nationwide coverage today. The network and the entire FirstNet team has done a great job in building out our 5G network. We\u2019ve been active in the bond market. Rates are low, demand is healthy, and we used this opportunity to issue about $17 billion in long term debt at rates significantly below our average cost of debt. This allowed us to materially reduce our near term debt towers, making our debt obligations for the next few years very manageable. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined with debt management. Ongoing liability management strategies are actively being considered to maintain and improve flexibility and reduce risk. We have several other levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure. We expect to close about $2 billion in pending sales from CME, real estate, and tower monetizations this year. We also expect to close our Puerto Rico wireless sale soon, with those funds used to redeem some preferred interest. You should expect us to continue exploring other opportunities. I now would like to turn it back to John for an update on our business transformation and HBO Max. John? John Stankey : Thanks John. Let me give you more detail about our business transformation on Slide 9.  If anything, COVID has led us to ramping these efforts. We\u2019re moving forward on the 50 work streams I mentioned earlier, which we believe can generate $6 billion in savings over three years. We\u2019ve made good progress in hitting our short term objectives, but there is much to do over the next couple of years.  Our workforce realignment and reduction of labor costs is underway. We restructured some of our benefit plans earlier in the year and we made several moves to streamline operations. Within the communications business, we\u2019re also streamlining our distribution. The closure of retail stores during COVID gave us the unique opportunity to review our retail and third party distribution capabilities. Some of our least productive stores won\u2019t reopen, other locations will shift to independent distributors, and we\u2019re enhancing our online and omni channel capabilities to align with how customers want to do business with us. Our market and product focus will drive simplification into our operations and resize our operating and technology footprint, all while taking further advantage of our evolution to cloud and virtualized services.  Our shift to software-based entertainment with ATT TV is validating our assumptions on customer self-install. We expect this coupled with the growth of our fiber-based broadband subscribers will improve service levels and reduce field operating costs.  We\u2019re also giving our call center representatives improved capabilities to streamline and enhance the sales and service function, and we\u2019re rationalizing and modernizing our billing and collection systems. Last, we\u2019re pursuing incremental opportunities to take out additional cost around corporate functions across the company. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve had some success in this regard but work remains to further streamline the functions that support those directly serving customers.  Bottom line, we\u2019re off to a good start on our transformation work. We have management teams in place on each of our major initiatives and a senior level governance structure to guide and resource this work. We\u2019re in great shape to do exactly what we said we\u2019re going to do. Now I want to provide you with an update on the success of our HBO Max launch on Slide 10. First, I want to give full credit to the entire HBO Max team, which put together a flawless launch. I\u2019m extremely proud of their efforts and accomplishments. We effectively established a new distribution framework for WarnerMedia. The platform performed superbly, activations were strong and the content is world class, and the team developed and launched the service in a short time frame and managed to get it all over the finish line in the middle of a pandemic. We\u2019re right on track with the targets we discussed with you last fall for HBO Max subscribers, activations and revenues.  HBO Max\u2019s diverse library of content appeals to everyone in the family, letting us reach a much broader demographic than our traditional HBO service. With that broader appeal, we\u2019ve been able to expand beyond the traditional HBO subscriber base. We finished the quarter with 36.3 million U.S. subscribers to HBO Max and HBO, up from 34.6 million at the end of last year. Customer engagement has exceeded our expectations. It\u2019s the early days, but the average number of weekly hours spent viewing Max is 70% more than on HBO now, clearly demonstrating the strength of our library and our success broadening the appeal of the product to more family members. It\u2019s our WarnerMedia owned content that\u2019s at the top of the viewing list, and that\u2019s driving the majority of the total hours consumed on the platform. In the streaming business, your content library is the key to keeping customers, but it\u2019s the new originals that drive subscriber acquisition. With COVID shutting down content production in March, we have been challenged to get all the originals on the platform that we\u2019d planned, but we like the early reception of what we\u2019ve been able to get in front of the customer base thus far. We launched Max with six new originals. All were found in the top 25 viewed series on the platform. By August, we\u2019ll have 21 new original series on Max which we expect to sustain our near term acquisition efforts. Like everyone else in the industry, we\u2019re working on ways to resume production and we hope to see that engine start to fire back up next month. Having said that, it\u2019s one of our more challenging things we\u2019re doing to respond to the pandemic and it\u2019s going to take time to return to our February production levels. We view getting our production back online as critical to making our 2021 subscriber plan.  One month after launch, HBO Max had about 3 million retail subscribers and 4.1 million subscribers had activated their Max accounts. Of those, more than 1 million were wholesale subscribers through AT&T. As you might expect, we\u2019re seeing more rapid activation with subscribers who are active users of HBO digital offers, but we still have work to do to educate and motivate the exclusively linear subscriber base and we\u2019ll continue to work with our wholesale partners to drive these activation rates.  We\u2019re also bundling HBO Max with some of our premium wireless and fiber plans. We\u2019re seeing a positive pull-through that\u2019s at or better than the wireless unlimited plan step-up assumptions we shared with you in October. You will recall this coupled with the 5G handset upgrade cycle is one of the key drivers to growing wireless service revenues in the latter half of the year. Finally, we\u2019ve worked hard to make HBO Max available to consumers through nearly every content distributor in the United States. We\u2019ve tried repeatedly to make HBO Max available to all customers using Amazon Fire devices, including those customers that have purchased HBO via Amazon. Unfortunately, Amazon has taken an approach of treating HBO Max and its customers differently than how they\u2019ve chosen to treat other services and their customers. We\u2019re glad to have agreements in place with, among others, Apple TV and Google Chromecast to give customers the right to stream HBO Max on those devices. Amir, that\u2019s our presentation. We\u2019re now ready to go to the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hudlick from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hudlick : Thanks guys. Maybe if you could drill down into the entertainment segment a little bit. John Stephens, I think you mentioned some--about the non-cash piece that may have affected EBITDA on a year-over-year basis, maybe give a bit more color that, and then anything you guys can tell us on volume trends? I realize there\u2019s a real lack of visibility as we look into the second half, but the video losses got a little bit better, even with the KAC pulled out. But just how you see video and broadband trends as we look out into the second half of the year would be great, thanks. John Stephens : Thanks John, thanks for your question. Let me give you a couple of thoughts and have John join in. One point is, we did get a little bit better on the customer trends, and that did include, I think it was 91,000, if you will, accrued disconnects, customers who we\u2019re still providing service. If you back that out, it was--there was a step down, it was an improvement. But we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, and so we\u2019re being real careful with how we address the situation. Secondly, we were real pleased with the AT&T TV rollout. It has been successful and it comes--and it\u2019s working. Once again, because of the pandemic, some of the home installs and some of that activity has been limited, so once again we\u2019re cautious as we come out of that. Third, to specifically reference, we amortize installment costs like the whole industry does, and because of AT&T TV, those installment costs from a cash basis are going down, but the amortization of prior year installment costs are still here, so we\u2019ve taken a more conservative view on the lifing of those, so those costs are up year-over-year. When you adjust for that, we actually had cash EBITDA actually grow when you make that adjustment, but for COVID we would have seen an increase. It\u2019s challenging business, continue to focus on cost savings, and continue to generate a lot of cash out of it, but the important piece is this utilization of AT&T TV now and taking into that overall strategy of software-based entertainment programs. John, you want to add anything to that? John Stankey : John, there is clearly gross pressure, and I\u2019d offer a couple thoughts around this. Our churn on the base improved again sequentially, and that\u2019s even with the Keep America Connected adjustment in there, and so the base dynamic is actually getting better and the team is doing a nice job of keeping the right customers and servicing them in the right way. But the gross pressures are pretty significant and I would say to the extent that reason comes back for people to engage in pay TV, such as sports returning where there is some feeling of something that they\u2019re missing, if that doesn\u2019t recover, it\u2019s going to continue to pressure throughout the balance of this year. Now, what I really like about what I see about our opportunity if we start seeing that gross recover is, as we shared with you, the ATT TV response has been really strong. Customers like the product, it\u2019s a much better product to use. It\u2019s clearly something that allows us to attack more of the market, given the lower SAC costs that John described, and the broadband attachment has been far superior to where we were with the previous product set, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons you saw the sequential improvement in fiber as we move forward here. So I think that dynamic is going to be good for us as we move through the year, but I really need to see some reason for a customer to want to get into the pay TV product, and that\u2019s going to probably correlate to what we see on the sports portfolio. John Hudlick : Got it, thanks guys. John Stephens : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hey guys, thanks a lot. Still on the pledge, what\u2019s been the response from those customers in July as you ask them for payment, and can you quantify at all how much revenue you didn\u2019t recognize from those customers in the second quarter? John Stephens : Yes, let me give you the cheat sheet way of doing it. I think about it as--I think the most conservative way is just taking a month\u2019s revenue on a postpaid customer, and you guys have the ARPU numbers so you can understand what that revenue would be like, so I\u2019d give you that focus. In our detailed schedules that we\u2019ve provided, we provided a reconciliation of what we saw as revenue pressure in mobility from COVID, it\u2019s included in there and I think that revenue for the quarter was $450 million inclusive of international roaming and these kinds of payments. So what I would suggest to you is that\u2019s the easiest way to calculate it. A couple of things. One, we\u2019re actively contacting, working with and trying to retain these customers, and certainly we haven\u2019t given up on that and they haven\u2019t given up on us. Clearly we are hopeful of retaining many of these customers, but since they\u2019re not paying us, our rules would--our processes, our transparency processes would tell us just to treat these as disconnects. I know some others in the industry have different views on it, they may push this off to the third quarter or later in the year, or may make base adjustments and so forth. We\u2019re just not doing that. We\u2019re just taking it upfront and laying it out for you, not only on wireless but on video and on broadband, and I point this out because the video and the broadband numbers are measurable also - 91,000 video and almost 160,000 on broadband.  Hopefully that explains--I mean, if you think about that postpaid number, one month\u2019s revenues, and a normal ARPU kind of gives you an indication of the kind of money we\u2019re talking about. Phil Cusick : Yes, so I\u2019m just curious, so three weeks into July, as I expect, you\u2019ve been contacting these customers. What\u2019s been the response? Can you give us any kind of hit rate or what they look like in terms of responding with some ability to pay? John Stephens : Yes, so it\u2019s been generally a positive response. We\u2019ll tell you, we assumed that we\u2019d get some of these customers back in this accrual, just so you know that. There isn\u2019t a--there is this [indiscernible] that we would win some of those back. We\u2019re doing a little bit better than that accrual, but it\u2019s still too early. We still have a significant number out there, and quite frankly, I want to point out we refer to this as the Keep America Connected program or pledge. There is a number of them out there. There is not only at the federal FCC level, but there is a number of them out there at the state by state level, so this is something that will be with us through the whole quarter. Phil Cusick : Okay, one other if I can- John Stephens : I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number, Phil. I just would tell you in all three segments, we are working really hard to retain those customers. Phil Cusick : Okay, but doing a little better than your accrual, that\u2019s good. One other, if I can. Can you quantify at all the sports cost amortization that will probably come back, given the leagues\u2019 plans for the third quarter? We saw really great margins from Turner this quarter. I just want to make sure I understand where we should be ready for that to go in the third quarter. John Stephens : Yes, I think if you look at what we spelled out in the--the best indication of that is going to be what we spelled out in the COVID schedules, where we listed out those impacts. But you\u2019re right, Phil - we will have a sports cost come back in for the NBA particularly, and we\u2019ll have those revenues come back, and as we expressed to you, those just two pieces of direct costs generally leave a pressure on the business, and we got relief of that pressure in the first quarter because of the delays and now we\u2019ll recognize that accounting in the third quarter here, so we will see that. I think you see the biggest piece to that really showing up in the COVID schedules that we disclosed. Phil Cusick : Thanks John. John Stephens : Thank you Phil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Okay, great. Good morning. Thanks so much. John, I think you said COVID is going to be with us for a while. Can you just give us a little color on what\u2019s happening in the wireless stores today, how are sales comparing to year-ago levels? Are you getting back even with maybe some of the rollbacks we\u2019ve seen in some of the southern states as well, and what\u2019s going on, on the business wire line side? Those results were very strong. How are those conversations going?  Then you outlined the transformation benefits, $6 billion. Perhaps just help us understand how--is that going to be fairly ratable over the next three years? Any color around timing would be great. John Stankey : Sure. How are you doing, Simon? First of all, traffic has bounced back in the stores pretty well. It\u2019s still not quite entirely back - you know, you have pockets where it\u2019s maybe back to normal, other pockets where it\u2019s suppressed a bit. Part of it is, as we\u2019ve shared with you, we\u2019re now giving customers other options on how to fulfill, so in some cases using omni channel capabilities, they\u2019re doing work online and simply rolling by the front of the store to pick something up. But I\u2019d say by and large, I don\u2019t feel in any way, shape or form we\u2019re impeded in retail relative to what customers wish to do with us, and it\u2019s just a matter of what we\u2019re seeing generally in the broader population of people being out and about.  We\u2019re starting to see a little bit of life coming back into the handset cycle right now. I\u2019d expect a little bit later this year there will probably be some new product in the market from certain manufacturers that is going to further stimulate some store traffic, and feel like we\u2019re dealing with it fairly effectively, so not really worried about the retail dynamic at this point. I think it\u2019s recovering reasonably well. The biggest wildcard on that is what\u2019s happening in states that are pressured a little bit with COVID. Hopefully as people try to get the infection rate under control, it\u2019s not an entire lockdown again. From my point of view, that doesn\u2019t seem to be necessary. My observation is we\u2019re able to manage the dynamics in retail pretty well in terms of safety and how people do business. There\u2019s other activities that are probably the higher risk things, but who knows? As we all know, the decision making is not always as clean and factual as it needs to be in those cases, so we\u2019re going to have to see where that goes. On the business side, we had a strong quarter, and I would say that I would expect it will be hard to sustain that level into third quarter, and we expected--you know, we kind of forecasted that in how we\u2019ve characterized for you how the year shapes up.  We\u2019re going to see pressure especially in the lower end of the business market. We\u2019ve already taken a fair amount of it. If you look in the entertainment segment, we were really heavy in bars and restaurants and some of the pay TV services we have, and they\u2019ve been hit really hard and a lot of them have not come back. Then in the data services side and telephone services side for the small end of the market, I expect there\u2019s going to be continued pressure there. Now, if there\u2019s a silver lining relative to our portfolio, I think as you\u2019re aware, our enterprise segment is probably more oriented to mid and larger businesses generally speaking overall. I think they\u2019ll be in a better position to sustain what\u2019s going to be a tough economic environment, but that business does cycle with how the economy moves and we\u2019re going to see some pressure on that as we move into the third quarter and what that does for our performance there. I think we\u2019ve got it [indiscernible] pretty well relative to how we\u2019ve set expectations with you on cash moving through the year. On where we are with our $6 billion efforts, I think what you--I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s ratable. What I would say is we\u2019ve got probably some short term things we were able to do early in the cycle, so you\u2019re starting to see that momentum come in. You can clearly see we\u2019re doing some work right now on the reserves we set up for some restructuring that we put out, that is directly tied to our plans around what we\u2019re doing for some of the efficiency work and restructuring that\u2019s going on.  You kind of see the midterm or maybe it drops off a little bit as we\u2019re working some of the technology initiatives and business improvement initiatives that take a period of cycle as you move through software development that\u2019s necessary, and then as you get into the latter part, those bounce in and start to occur, so I\u2019m not going to call it an inverted V - it\u2019s not that, but you get a lot upfront, you see a little bit of softening, and then it pops up in the tail end and comes back in, so maybe risk adjust it in that fashion. Simon Flannery : That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. This one might be for either one of the two Johns. Could you guys address the timing and/or criteria and some of the political considerations about restarting the buyback program, and whether it\u2019s a certainty that that buyback program comes back in \u201921 or not?  Then the second question is related to the wireless business. Maybe this one is for John Stephens. The two forces are the pressure from overage and roaming at the revenue line offset a little bit by the equipment on the--the lower equipment velocities, and then also you had this hazard pay for the union forces. Can you talk about which of these forces is going to be stronger? Is it hazard pay going away and that\u2019s going to give you a lift? Is the equipment going to accelerate and that\u2019s going to be a pressure? When does the roaming come back? If we could get some color on those moving forces, it would be helpful. Thank you. John Stephens : David, thanks for the question. Let me take the second one first. With regard to mobility, think about it this way. John just mentioned that we felt good about our retail space. If you look at the equipment revenue in the second quarter, it actually grew and that was from a rebound in our retail stores, our equipment sales did rebound. That\u2019s because they\u2019re open and this hazard pay and some of the issues with regards to what we\u2019ve done on mobility are ebbing, and we\u2019re opening. Secondly, I would say that on the overall mobility, we grew EBITDA even with those costs of the pandemic, even with the pressure from international roaming, the pressure from waiving late fees or overage charges, and pressure from Connect America. So from my perspective, we\u2019re in very good shape with those things, to work through those even currently, but going forward, and the big piece of that is we\u2019ve had a lot of cost initiatives that allow for us to grow that. Even with those additional costs from COVID, as you say, the battle pay, so to speak, we were able to keep costs in line and grow EBITDA, so from my perspective, I think we\u2019re in a very good position.  As we work through the Connect America--Keep America Connected groups, as we get to a more stable environment, we feel very good about where the mobility business is going. It\u2019s been a tremendous cash generator, so feel good about that. John Stankey : On the question, Dave, regarding where we are on stock buybacks, I would tell you it\u2019s too early to call anything. The board is going to sit down in their annual planning cycle in September and, broadly speaking, we\u2019re going to look at capital allocation. We\u2019ve shared with you that our concerns around visibility remain, clearly as I indicated in my opening remarks, with COVID being with us for a long period of time, and we\u2019re going to be in this up and down dynamic. It\u2019s too early to tell exactly what\u2019s going to occur, and I expect as we get into the latter part of the third quarter, maybe we have a little bit better visibility of what 2021 looks like and what the circumstances are, and we\u2019ll spend time with the board in September talking about that broadly and looking at the investment opportunities that are in front of us and how we want to deploy capital and the best way to give the right returns back. But I\u2019m not going to prognosticate one way or the other on that at this point. John Stephens : One thing to add, we\u2019ve been really successful in managing the debt towers and managing the cost of our debt. We did about $17 billion in issuances in the last month and using that to retire previously issued debt at better interest rates with better timing and spreads, much more manageable towers, so we\u2019re very active and, quite frankly, the bond market has responded quite well. Our yields are as competitive for us as I\u2019ve ever seen, so I would tell you we\u2019re very active in the capital markets just on managing that debt side, and I think the markets have responded well to that.  I\u2019d just add that in. That\u2019s been a real focus, and it will continue to be a focus of ours. David Barden : Great, thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks, and good morning. I was hoping to return to some of the priorities, John, that you discussed at the beginning of the call. Just two questions on that. First, you described being a broadband provider is the first priority. What does that mean for the pace at which you want to expand fiber to the home or gigabit access to the home if you can use other technologies, such as 5G?  The second question was on your second priority, which is the focus on being a software-based entertainment provider, and you mentioned AT&T TV as part of that opportunity. To be successful with AT&T TV, does AT&T need to own the DirectTV satellite video business? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi Mike, thanks for the questions. On the broadband side, I have an appetite to get back to building footprint on fiber, and I think I\u2019ve indicated that before. I wouldn\u2019t quite pigeonhole it in the way you asked the question relative to households. I have an appetite to build fiber that serves a combination of our needs in the consumer space, what we need to do to deploy 5G, and what can help our business segment. Really, the unique position we\u2019re in as a business is we have lines of business in all those areas, and that should give us leverage in fiber deployment that I think others that are either only a fixed line provider and reselling wireless services, or those that are only wireless providers and trying to deploy more fiber-intensive 5G networks don\u2019t enjoy.  My investment thesis and my point of view on our company is that if we do our engineering correctly and we think about our planning properly, we should be getting yields off of very lineal foot of fiber we put in that nobody else can achieve. So I think about this and we\u2019re working it through from a planning perspective right now, it\u2019s how we get the leverage across all three segments, not just the homes that we pass, although the net effect of that will be there will be communities that we\u2019ve built.  I personally do not believe that 5G is a replacement in the near term for suburban residential single family living units. As an optimal strategy, I think it\u2019s going to be a tough one to beat when there is embedded gigabit-capable fixed line networks in place, so I think there is clearly going to be stuff on the margin that makes sense around that but I don\u2019t believe in the near term that 5G is the right fixed line replacement strategy in what I would call the typical single family home infrastructure.  Look, if it ultimately moves that way and we start to see the technology stabilizing, we\u2019re as well positioned as anybody to pivot to that. We\u2019ve certainly got the spectrum and the assets to make that happen, but I\u2019m just not of the mindset right now that that\u2019s the optimal place to win in the market. On the software-based side, I think what I\u2019ve shared with you is my belief is that ultimately you\u2019re coming together with one distribution platform for entertainment. Today we\u2019ve kind of seen SBAUD [ph] and pay TV platforms grow up independently, and there is good reasons why that\u2019s occurred up to this point in time, but there is no reason we should think that over the long haul that once customers are aggregated on one platform or the other, that live stays separate from on-demand general entertainment content. We\u2019re going to see these products ultimately come together. So when I talk about software-based entertainment, I think about the fact that we want a platform with a lot of customers on it that is capable of either delivering general entertainment content under an SBAUD construct or whatever is that appropriate mix of live linear moving forward, and I think that\u2019s probably the optimal way to meet customer needs as we go forward.  Do I think that satellite is necessary to respond in that area? You can go back and look at comments I made, I think very early on, you know, post transaction of DirectTV that we didn\u2019t necessarily make that move because we loved satellite as a technology to deliver premium entertainment-based video content. We liked the customer base, and it was an opportunity to move that customer base into the right technology platforms moving forward. That\u2019s clearly where we\u2019re investing and what we\u2019re doing right now, which is building those software platforms that can deliver either live or on-demand entertainment-based content and have that relationship with the customer, using data and analytics we pulled from that and hopefully bridge off other services that those platforms can ultimately deliver. I don\u2019t necessarily view satellite technology as the place that\u2019s necessary to make that happen. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yes, thanks for taking the question. One of the areas where we\u2019ve seen a real difficulty driving a reopening is in movie going. You\u2019ve already had to adjust Tenet a couple of times, you\u2019ve acknowledged it\u2019s going to be a very different release than we\u2019ve historically seen. In light of the uncertainty around getting back to normal with that experience, and also with the direct platform you now have in HBO Max, can you talk about whether you think there\u2019s an opportunity or need to evolve your film release and windowing schedule, and in particular whether you think HBO Max could be a much more important launch point for your films going forward? Thank you. John Stankey : Sure, Brett. Look, I think I said last quarter that I fully expected that coming out of COVID that I would be surprised if the industry as a whole didn\u2019t see some adjustment in the theatrical construct. I also made the point that, look, I think theatrical still has an absolute important role moving forward. There\u2019s just some content that is going to be more enjoyable and better to see in theaters than in the living room, and we fully believe that and we want to work with our theatrical partners and our exhibitors to ensure that we work with them and try to get through this very difficult period. However, I don\u2019t know when theaters are going to reopen, just like I\u2019m not sure I can say I know exactly when schools are going to reopen and what the circumstances are going to be around it. There\u2019s no question that the longer this goes on, there is going to be some content on the margin that we\u2019d look at and say it may be better served to be distributed in another construct or a different construct.  I love the fact that we have that option now. I love the reality that we\u2019ve been able to build a platform that we can get leverage and capabilities out of any content we build, theatrical or otherwise, and pick the platform and where we go with it. Do I think that there could be some things that we originally chartered and built for theatrical release that maybe migrates into an SBAUD construct? Sure, I think that could occur. Is it going to happen on a movie like Tenet or something like Wonder Woman? I\u2019d be very surprised if that would be the case. In fact, I can assure you on Tenet, that\u2019s not going to be the case.  So I think we\u2019re just going to take it a case at a time. It\u2019s nice to have the optionality, and as I shared with you in the last earnings call when we looked at the slate, we already have moved some of our future production slate where we\u2019ve re-tooled it for what would probably have been a theatrical release that we\u2019re choosing to execute the movie as what\u2019s going to be a direct to streaming construct. Yes, I think there are going to be some shifts as we move forward here. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Hey guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick one on the wireless revenue-slash-ARPU. What were you guys seeing out there as far as customers potentially trading down to lower plans, given the work-from-home environment and most things being WiFi-based instead?  Then back on the business wire line side, are you guys seeing any slowdown in decision making on the enterprise side? We\u2019ve seen that historically in economic downturns and getting some whispers out there on that. Just wondering what you\u2019re seeing. Then if you don\u2019t mind, John Stephens, on the working capital side, just the pacing in the back half on working capital. John Stankey : Let me just take the front end of that and then John can come in and do the clean-up here. Frankly, quite the opposite right now in our postpaid business of what\u2019s occurring. We are--I think we indicated in some of the comments we are already seeing the dynamic of the attach rate of the better unlimited and the higher ARPU unlimited plans increasing, and I made that point deliberately because this is where HBO Max and wireless come together nicely. We\u2019re giving customers a reason to go up in the more robust unlimited plans, and we\u2019re already seeing that penetration increase. We shared with you in October that that was an important driver through a combination of the incentives we would give people on the 5G network to buy into the upper end unlimited plans, as well as how Max complements those, and we are seeing that success with Max, so check the box on the front end of that. Once we have the right kind of equipment showing up on the 5G side, I think we will see that momentum continue and carry forward. I think wireless has become more indispensable to customers in the work-from-home environment, not less. They\u2019re relying more on their devices, they\u2019re using them more. It\u2019s an important utility and tool for them to execute the mix of their personal and business lives, and so the trend has actually been really good around that. On the enterprise side, as I mentioned earlier, I think that it\u2019s going to directly correlate to what happens in the economy overall as we move forward. The good news is we service a lot of important economic segments in our enterprise business and we are skewed heavier to the mid in that market, as I talked about, and as the airline industry continue to move through its challenges, our customer base is going to move through its challenges. As the hospitality industry moves through its challenges, our customer base is going to move through its challenges, and we\u2019re going to work with them in going through that dynamic because they\u2019re important customers of ours and we have longstanding relationships.  But as I said, I would expect that third and fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to see some pressure in that segment as a result of that. I think we\u2019ve done a reasonable job of trying to forecast what that\u2019s going to look like, but I can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to see tailwinds as we get through that dynamic. John, do you want to--? John Stephens : Yes, let me just take--. If you look at the postpaid ARPU, we\u2019re seeing the growth that John\u2019s talking about when you take into account the fact that the international roaming and the COVID impacts, so that\u2019s how you see it. Then HBO Max has been a good attachment, a good opportunity for us to grow those elite packages and people moving up, so we\u2019ve been really--you know, we\u2019ve been pleased with the way the wireless business is going. With your question, Mike, on working capital, traditionally we\u2019re second half of the year weighted towards free cash flow and so forth, and I wouldn\u2019t expect this year to be any different other than the fact that everything this year is different because of COVID. We continue to have really a focus on working capital and free cash flow, and I would say in the second quarter we saw some good activity on accounts receivable and collections and so forth. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that it\u2019s better than any prior years, but it was, I will say, better or as good as I would have expected in a pandemic situation.  With that being said, we continue to watch things carefully, continue to focus on working capital generation ideas, and we\u2019re kind of watching that and watching our receivables. All that being said, we\u2019re on a good track. We had a 50% dividend payout ratio this quarter, we\u2019re on track for full year--year to date, we\u2019re on track already and we usually have a better second half than we do first half, so we feel really good about the commitments and are really targeting the low end of the 60s for the payout ratio, and we\u2019re striving to beat that target. Last thing I\u2019ll say is that is still with $20 billion of capex investment, and I want to make sure we reiterate that. The cash flows that we\u2019re getting are coming from the operations of the business, not from cutting capex. We\u2019re staying in line with capex, so. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much, Mike. We\u2019ll turn it over to John for some final remarks. John Stankey : Thanks very much everybody for being with us today. Appreciate the discussion and the questions, and what I would say overall, the quarter represented what I thought was some solid execution in a really challenging environment. I don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to see much change in the third quarter around those challenges that are in front of us, but the cash flow numbers were very, very encouraging and certainly--you know, what I take a lot of heart in, I thought the team did a great job on the launch of HBO Max. I think that puts us in a unique position to have a lot of optionality as we move forward and reshape the media business.  I expect we\u2019re going to be dealing with some of these economic challenges in the COVID environment as we move forward here, and as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re operating accordingly, including pushing a lot harder on what we need to do on the cost and efficiency side to get our business positioned to do this. We\u2019d be doing it anyway, but clearly the uncertainty in the environment moving forward makes that more important to us. We\u2019re blessed to have a very resilient subscription business, and we\u2019ll continue to lean on that and use those cash flows to invest wisely moving forward. As you heard John talk about, the fact we remain committed to putting our capital against the areas where we think there is an opportunity to grow this business moving forward and come out of the backside of this pandemic stronger than where we came in, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that and move forward. Appreciate you being with us today. Hope you all stay safe and enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I\u2019m Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations Web site. And as always, our earnings materials are also available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T Web site. I also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the NCC spectrum auction 107, so we cannot address any questions about that today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019re all healthy and doing well and thank you for joining us this morning. John and I are going to keep our comments brief so we can spend more time taking your questions, so let\u2019s start with Slide 3. First, our industry leading network is the driver of our strong wireless, customer accounts and our healthy broadband and enterprise trends. Our high-quality network underpins our connectivity business and our commitment to customers. Ookla last week ranked AT&T #1 for having the fastest nationwide 5G network and for the seventh quarter in a row, we won the overall fastest wireless network and were named fastest wireless network for iPhones in the third quarter. J.D. Power last month named us tops in customer satisfaction for residential Internet service in every region we offer that service. The net promoter scores we\u2019re achieving with our fiber products are materially better than cables and are helping drive increasing penetration rates across our markets. I'm really pleased with the great execution from our AT&T communications team led by Jeff McElfresh under some really challenging circumstances. Second, the transformation of our business continues and is on track with how we set this up for you a year ago. The organization has been working to reduce costs, streamline distribution, remove redundancies, and simplify processes and support functions. Our focus is supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience. Accordingly, these efficiencies are being plowed back into growth in our market focus areas. And third, we're committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining our deliberate capital allocation. We've made material progress this year with our debt management, while generating solid free cash flow to support our dividend. John will provide more detail, but you're seeing a sharply focused capital structure that is strong, resilient, and efficient. We also have a very pragmatic view of the broader economic picture and the COVID driven challenges we faced in some segments, particularly WarnerMedia. In a COVID environment with a tough theatrical business, we made important organizational moves that further position us for growth in direct to consumer streaming. Through the pandemic, we continue to invest in HBO Max and continue to grow total HBO and HBO Max subscribers. I'm pleased with how the WarnerMedia team is responding to a challenging environment. In closing, we recognize that we have more work to do in executing on our vision and earning the loyalty of our customers and investors. I believe this quarter shows we've taken the first few steps in the right direction, but there's more opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to John to quickly review the details of the quarter. John Stephens : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As John said, during the third quarter, we made progress on our business priorities as you can see in our subscriber gains. Wireless growth was stronger than we've seen in quite some time. We added more than 1 million postpaid subscribers, including 645,000 postpaid phones. We also saw solid growth in AT&T fiber subscribers with more than 350,000 fiber net ads, and our HBO Max activation base more than doubled in the first full quarter since we launched the business. We now have 38 million U.S. HBO Max and HBO subscribers and 57 million premium subscribers globally. Our cost transformation continues on track. We\u2019re already seeing savings achieved from benefit efficiencies and organizational alignments. Our focus on refining our distribution is also paying off. We shifted some stores to third party dealers, closed others and we've also been able to streamline our customer experience, especially our digital sales and simplify processes. We've been very deliberate in managing our debt and focusing on our cash flow. So far this year, we have refinanced more than 60 billion of debt at historically low rates, with about 30 billion of debt coming due through 2025. This has lowered our near-term debt maturities giving us ample financial flexibility in the years ahead. We now expect free cash flow of 26 billion or higher with a full year dividend payout ratio percentage in the high 50s. Slide 6 illustrates the success we've had this quarter in our market focused areas. As mentioned, postpaid phone adds were strong. A big factor was postpaid phone churn of 0.69%, our best ever. Prepaid churn was less than 3% and Cricket churn was even lower than that. Improved postpaid churn was driven by the strength of our network and straightforward pricing plans, including our premium unlimited plan, which includes bundling HBO Max. Penetration rates for AT&T fiber are also growing as you can see on the chart on the lower left. We're on track to grow our fiber base by 25% this year, adding 1 million new subscribers. On the upper right chart, HBO Max continues to scale. We've over-performed on our initial target of 36 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers for this year. All this is before we launch our AVOD product in the U.S. next year and before we begin our international deployment of HBO Max also planned for next year. As you can see in the premium video chart in the lower right, we continue to make good progress in moving to ratable share losses in our pay TV business consistent with our share. This is a big step toward what we told you to expect as we exited 2020. We are focused on high-value subscribers as the industry transitions to over the top, which has helped improve churn. The introduction of AT&T TV has helped, particularly in our broadband footprint. Let's now take a look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on Slide 7. Cash flows continue to be strong, even during the pandemic. Cash from operations came in at more than $12 billion and free cash flow was 8.3 billion. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 per share. That included COVID impacts from incremental costs and lost revenues. Combined, COVID had a $0.21 impact to the third quarter EPS, which we did not adjust for. Adjustments for the quarter included 1.2 billion of debt redemption premiums associated with our debt management activity in the quarter. Revenues were down 2.2 billion from a year ago, including an estimated 2.8 billion of lost or deferred revenue from COVID and foreign exchange pressures. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about 300 million in revenue, primarily in our Latin America segment. Adjusted operating income was about $8.2 billion, which included the impact of COVID and shift of TV productions and sports to the third quarter. Lower revenues were partly offset by expense reductions. Adjusted operating income margins were down 280 basis points year-over-year, but would have been up if you exclude COVID impacts. And we continue to invest in our growth areas. CapEx was 3.9 billion and gross capital investment was 4.5 billion, a difference attributed to the timing of vendor payment. And we invested about $600 million in HBO Max in the quarter and are on track with full year estimated investment of $2 billion. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our communication segment on Slide 8. Our core businesses continue to show their resiliency. In mobility, in addition to strong total postpaid and postpaid phone net adds, we saw a strong demand for data connected devices. We had 730,000 total smartphone net adds both postpaid and prepaid. Prepaid had a solid quarter with 245,000 net adds with 131,000 of those phones. Bottom line, we're encouraged by our wireless market positioning heading into the fourth quarter, traditionally the busiest season for device upgrades and people moving to unlimited plans. Total wireless revenues were up year-over-year, thanks to growth in equipment revenues. COVID impacts came from international roaming as well as waived data overages and late payments. Without the roaming impacts alone, service revenues would have had a healthy growth. Roaming also impacted EBITDA margins, which were down slightly, even with much higher sales. We\u2019re pleased with AT&T fiber net add momentum, we're on track to add 1 million subscribers this year and the mix shift to fiber has helped stabilize broadband revenues. Premium video losses were improved sequentially and year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. The decline is a significant improvement over prior year trends. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 7%. Business wireline turned in another solid EBITDA quarter. EBITDA was up year-over-year and margins expanded by 130 basis points, despite legacy revenue trends. Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. The COVID impact is most evident in our WarnerMedia results. Theatrical and TV production is ramping back up, but theaters remained closed in many parts of the country. Altogether, COVID had an estimated 1.6 billion revenue impact on WarnerMedia in the quarter. Sports resumed in the quarter and programming and production costs associated with the shift to sports into the third quarter impacted expenses. At the same time, sports had a favorable impact on advertising revenues. HBO Max continued to scale nicely, driven by strong wholesale activations. We are also pleased with consumer engagement, which is up nearly 60% from what we saw with HBO Now. WarnerMedia\u2019s reputation as the industry's highest quality storyteller was again reinforced with it leading the industry with 38 Primetime and 15 News and Documentary Emmys. We also saw subscriber turnaround in our Latin America operations. We added more than 400,000 subscribers in Mexico and 200,000 subscribers in Vrio, after both showed a COVID slowdown in the second quarter. Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by foreign exchange, slow economies and COVID. But even with this, Mexico\u2019s EBITDA improved year-over-year, and Vrio continues to generate EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. Now let's go to Slide 10 for an update on our capital structure. Our cash flows continue to be resilient, even with the pandemic and allows us to invest in the business and comfortably pay for our dividend while also paying down debt. Free cash flow was 8.3 billion in the quarter and almost $20 billion year-to-date. In fact, we've reduced net debt by more than 30 billion since we closed our Time Warner acquisition a little more than two years ago. We continue to be active in the debt market. With interest rates at historical lows, we have been aggressive in refinancing our debt maturities and lowering our coupon rate. As you can see on the bottom chart, our near-term debt obligations have changed significantly since the first quarter. We have reduced debt maturities by almost 50% over the next five years. This has extended our average debt maturity, which is a good place to be with rates as low. In fact, we have lowered our average interest rate on debt to just under 4.1% with the lowest coupon rates we've ever seen. That gives us financial flexibility, not just for today but going forward as well. In fact, we ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash on our balance sheet. The 500 billion of assets on our total balance sheet also gives us ample opportunity to continue to strengthen our cash position by monetizing non-core assets. We expect $3 billion of previously announced asset sales to close before the end of the year, including CME which actually closed last week and our Puerto Rico wireless properties, which we expect to close by the end of October. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe on the subscriber side, obviously solid results really across the board and especially in wireless. Is there anything you guys can point to that really drove the gross add improvement that we saw on a year-to-year basis and the better churn? And do you think those results are sustainable? And then also on the fiber side, John, you've talked about repositioning the company around wireless fiber and software entertainment. How should we think about the footprint expansion of your guys\u2019 fiber network? Obviously, you grew a lot with the requirements for DirecTV, but how should we look at that over the next few years? Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, John. How are you? So, first, on the subscriber side, I think the answer is it's hard work and really good work. This is something that's been in the making for a period of time where the team has been focused on a variety of different strategies, and I'm not going to point to any one thing. I think we've done a number of things very well, including reengineering our distribution. We have a much broader approach to distribution today and a more effective approach in terms of efficiency of what it's bringing in. You heard John address some of that in his comments. We have been very, very focused on making sure we give value to our right customers. And data has helped us do that. And some of the gain you're seeing is that we're able to segment the portions of the market that we think we have issues to address on a value basis, and get the right kind of dynamics out to those customers through the right kind of distribution. That's working, because we have been very deliberate over the last several years, building a much higher quality network, starting with the FirstNet construct. And that higher quality network has removed a reason for customers to leave, because they're satisfied with the service that they're getting on the network infrastructure, as COVID hit and the wireless networks became much more suburban-oriented than urban-oriented, our strength in low band spectrum are literally undisputed strength and volume of low band spectrum has helped because the suburban experience is oftentimes a more distributed experience. And when you think about penetrating inside buildings, you need low band spectrum to do that. Mid band is not going to do that in a suburban environment nor is millimeter wave, at least not anytime soon, until density starts to pick up. And so we've been very focused on that. And we intend to be very focused on that moving forward. And I would tell you, I'll just answer it right now because I'm sure somebody's going to ask on our promotions that are out in the market, and what we're doing with the iPhone launch is more of the same. We have an incredibly valuable customer base. It's our most important asset for us to focus on. And when we go in and we look at the data and we understand why that base elects not to stay with us, it's not because of customer service or it's not because they don't like the network, it's because more often than not, they see some enticement to go somewhere else and that's usually a device offer or a belief that they can't fine tune their plan to meet their economic construct that they want. And we're now in a position where we can address that. And this offer is going to attack that very point. It's going to ensure that our very best customers, many have been very loyal to us. These are original iPhone subscribers that have been around a long time are treated just like a new customer coming into our business and that they can avail themselves of that opportunity and recommit to us for a very, very long period of time. And while we're getting to talk to them at that moment, we get an opportunity to chat with them about buying up to unlimited plans. And we get an opportunity to move them up the continuum to our higher value unlimited plans that include entertainment. And so that's a win-win for us in that construct and it pays off economically. Our base is less committed to contract than our competitors. We know that statistically. And part of this is just simply ensuring that our base is sitting in a similar position to our competitors, to make sure that we can continue this record breaking churn that we've set up. And that's a smart economic decision for us and it's a smart decision in positioning the brand with our customers. And so when we know we can address the number one reason why people are leaving us and do it this way, we get that accretion that comes out of buying up on the unlimited plans, getting them to the sticky entertainment, we think that's the right place for us to be. On your second question regarding fiber, my intent is to exit next year in a construct where we are gaining subscribers, gaining share and growing the broadband business. And our footprint will be engineered to allow that to happen. And we still have a lot of fiber that we can sell into. You saw that this quarter. We're selling into our existing footprint of a little over 14 million fiber homes and we're doing it very effectively. And you heard my comment about how much customers liked the product and that's one of the reasons we're having great success and we're going to continue to push in that footprint. We've been adding fiber footprint, as we've talked about, slowly. We're going to pick that up a bit so that we can make sure we're in a share gain position and we're actually growing the broadband business as we exit next year. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, John. Amir Rozwadowski : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. John, can you talk about priorities for next year? It sounds and you just said like you want to build more fiber? Does that mean that CapEx needs to be higher or can you really source that out of wireless CapEx coming down? And it's great to see video losses were lower, even after we normalized out the pledge customers. What were the drivers of that improvement and how does DirecTV fit into the company's plans? Is there anything you can say about these reports of a sale? Thank you. John Stankey : So we're not giving our guidance on capital for next year at this point. I will tell you that we feel comfortable that we can manage the cash flow equation effectively and do what I just said. I'm not concerned about that part of it. We\u2019ll come out a little bit later this year and we'll give you the guidance and lay out those numbers for you. But I feel really comfortable. If you kind of look at what's going on in these customer accounts certainly help. I think you're aware we're working really hard on the cost equation around here and that's helping us invest in some of the work we're doing in the markets. We have a very different build in front of us and we've traditionally had I think \u2013 if you think about what we've historically been doing on the fiber side, we've had to light up new central offices, kind of new geographic areas, which tends to be a little bit more expensive, have an opportunity to do some really economic fill-in and shorten the cycle from investment to cash that we can factor in on this. So we'll give you some direction next year, but I don't think you're going to see an appreciable change in our trajectory as we go through this. And we'll fill in the blanks for you coming forward here. On the video side, we've been focused on high-value customers. And so some of this, what you're seeing is, when we made this shift to kind of get out of the promotional dynamic and frankly others in the industry got out of a promotional dynamic where the VMPDs decided to go to a first price that's a little bit more reflective of their cost structure, that normalized a lot of things. We had to work through that for a couple of quarters, because it definitely impacts gross. Because the gross that we're taking in right now or effective customers are ones we can make money on and the ones that are not just churning back and forth, and we think that's a much better mix and you're starting to see us work through that cycle a little bit. But look, I want to give a lot of credit to the team as we've been clear on what our direction is. They're focused on ensuring that we run the business the right way and we've been a lot better at retention. We have a better product in the market right now for those people that we compare with broadband. The AT&T TV product is a much more natural fit in terms of how customers want to use a pay TV service today than the satellite product is. And when we compare it with broadband, which as you see we've got improved volumes on broadband, that helps our video business. So as we continue that momentum and we think about what we can do in the next year that can help the video business as well, I'm not going to suggest to you that it's anything but a mature business that's going to continue some degree of decline. But we told you, we'd like to exit this year with our decline rate looking more ratable to our share and we're on that march to do that. We're doing it by some tried-and-trued approaches to how we should manage the base, how we should manage our customers, what kind of service we should give them. And the team's done a really nice job of kind of getting back to basics on that and doing the right things around it. And the final question, I'm not going to comment on any speculation at this point. Phil Cusick : Thanks, John. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks. Can we move to the next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. On Warner, I wonder if you could just help us think about how things are progressing on the theatrical \u2013 the production for TV and movies and how you're thinking about that evolving and any big changes you might have there in terms of how we should think about the future post COVID? And then a capital allocation question. I think, John, you talked about the importance of the dividend and the track record of dividend growth. But it looks like you're not really getting paid for the dividend in the current market. How do you balance that versus, say, buybacks? Obviously, you've got spectrum options coming up that\u2019s deleveraging. You've addressed a lot of the near-term maturities. So I\u2019d love to think about the priorities and how you think about the order of preference there. Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Simon. So on the Warner side, I'm breathing easier. I think everybody's breathing easier. That's probably a bad analogy in the COVID environment. Feel much better about the restart of production. We exited, to kind of give you a rough idea, probably about 180 productions of some way, shape or form or underway in February before the pandemic hit. And I would tell you, roughly, probably \u2013 I haven't looked at the numbers in the last week or so, but I think we had about 130 productions up and running in some shape or form last week. So we're well back into that ramp back up. I don't think we have to get back to 180 by the way. There's some stuff we've rationalized, but we're starting to figure out how to do this. We clearly have gotten through most of the hurdles from a civic perspective where the geographies that we operate and produce in are working with us on what the constructs are, and there's no barriers to actually having to work, perform. I think we've got the right fields and unions squared away and we built in the right processes around testing. We're far enough into and far enough along with work that's going on where the confidence level of employees is growing day-by-day that we can in fact protect the safety of individuals and still get work done. So feel good about where that's at. I think we're out of the woods at this point from being dead cold in the middle of the pandemic to one where we feel like we can get ours produced and brought forward, and that's going to help our products. Most importantly, it's going to help HBO Max. Theatrical work is underway as well. We're doing the work for theatrical production. The question is, what does exhibition look like? And that's still kind of one of these things we don't have great visibility on. We've done some experimentation. We've tried a few things. I can't tell you that we walked away from the tenant experiencing, it was a homerun. I'm happy we did it. I think the team was incredibly creative. I think we learned a couple of things about what we can do. I actually believe that if theaters were open nationwide, if California and New York were open, we have some latitude to be able to do some of these geographic specific releases and work through that. So maybe as we get to a place where there's a little bit more consistent footprint, we can do some more. I'd say, the holiday season is going to be the next big checkpoint to see what occurs and whether or not we can actually move some content back into the theatrical exhibition and we're going to have to maybe make a game time decision on that based on what's happening in different geographies and what's happening effectively with infection counts in the country. We're still committed to want to try to put some of the content that we think is the most important into a theatrical channel if that makes sense. Now, at the same time, we're expecting this to be incredibly choppy moving into next year and guidance and direction we're giving you with the business takes that into account. We\u2019re not optimistic. We're not looking that we're seeing it, expecting a huge recovery in theatrical moving into the early part of next year. We're expecting it to continue to be choppy. And as a result of that, we're having to evaluate all of our options and keeping them open. And the team's kind of working the A plan, the B plan and the C plan. And as we get through the next month or two and we look at what's occurring, we'll call the cards on the A plan and the B plan and the C plan and kind of come back to you. So that's kind of the best I can give you on where we are and restarts on that. The other thing that I would tell you that we have a little bit of lack of visibility on is if you think about the broader media businesses, what happens with the sports calendar in '21. Clearly, we've seen the leagues demonstrate that they can in fact put games on and they can carry them through. The timing of those and how many there are and exactly what transpires in '21 and where it falls in the calendar is still a little bit uncertain. And until we have a little better visibility on that, it's hard to give you exact views of what first, second, third, fourth quarter looks like next year. And I think in the coming weeks, we'll probably get a little bit more clarity around that and be able to adjust the plans accordingly. And we've demonstrated that we can, in fact, do the right things around producing those safely and selling advertising into them. We just need to kind of see where the schedule shapes out. On your capital allocation question, I think the way you get paid is you probably execute consistently. And so I'm well aware that right now there is definitely a discontinuity in the yield versus what we're paying. And I don't like that. I'm sure nobody else out there owns the stock likes it. And I think the best way for us to kind of address that is make sure that each quarter we're delivering on what we tell you we're going to do and doing it consistently. And ultimately, I think that problem probably takes care of itself. But your point is a valid one, in the meantime, to ask about how we should think about things and where I've been and where I still sit is, I think when we have visibility getting through the COVID cycle, we can make those decisions on capital allocation. I think it's important that we can continue to manage the debt load down and that's our first priority to ensure that it isn't the discussion every time we sit down around where this business is at. We feel comfortable, as John indicated, that we\u2019ve restructured in a way that makes sense that we can manage this business and do the things we need to do to invest in growth. It's given us the space to do that and make sure that we can, in a very disciplined fashion, pay it down as we get through that and we have your confidence in that regard. And then we'll start looking at whether or not it makes sense for us to do something different on the equity side. I'd like to get some of this choppiness of COVID out of the way before we kind of move back into that cycle so that we can all be confident around what we think from an economic outlook perspective that we're managing into. I have no question we can manage through this cycle and keep the equation in check. I'm really confident of that. When we get to kind of that discretionary capital allocation piece it will be when I'm a little bit more comfortable that we know what the game plan is for the '21 timeframe, and I think we're getting a little bit closer to being able to make that call. John, do you want to add anything on that? John Stephens : No. Simon, we've got the balance sheet and the debt towers, the debt maturities in really good shape, a lot of flexibility not only over the near term as we spelled out in the slides but quite frankly over the long term. So feel very good about that. The bond market has responded very well to it. We\u2019ll continue to reduce our debt levels, but we've got a lot of flexibility going forward. And so I feel good about that. The one thing I'd say is, this all starts with a cash flow number and the resiliency of our products and services, the resiliency of our customers as they continue to pay us on a timely basis for our services is really, really important. That's the core of it. It\u2019s what John talked about when he's talking about low churn and it gives us a basis for all of this. So we feel very good about where we're going. Simon Flannery : Thanks for the color. Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : We're going to move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. John Stankey : Good morning, David. David Barden : Hi, guys. So, I guess, John Stephens, I guess this question is related to the guidance. So a couple of questions around it. So, at the beginning of the year, the math of kind of a low 60% dividend payout ratio was cash flows in the kind of $23 billion to $25 billion range. Now it's north of 26 billion. And so can we talk about some of the drivers of that? What part of that is related to lower CapEx as a function of vendor financing? What are the cash tax expectations that go into that? And what are the working capital expectations related to the iPhone promotions that John Stankey was talking about earlier kind of affecting that number, and kind of the exit trajectory into next year? And then I guess you're particularly qualified to answer the other question, which is \u2013 which we're getting a lot, which is if there's a dem sweep and the Biden tax proposal goes through, what does that mean for AT&T who was one of the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform under the current administration? How could that change cash flow outlook for AT&T? Thanks. John Stephens : Yes. So first thing, David, let me go back on the cash flow side. It really does [indiscernible] our customers. And when we came out with our guidance for the year, there was uncertainty and lack of visibility with regard to COVID. So we were careful and prudent with that. It turns out our \u2013 and you can see it in the third quarter balance sheet, you can see it in the third quarter results, our collection rates have been very good. The resiliency of the products, appreciation for the service, we're getting paid on a timely basis and at very good levels. And so that's the first point. The second point is across the board, there's been working capital efforts, whether it's managing receivables, managing payables, whether it's tax payments, that all has been done. Some of that came out of the CARES Act with the benefits of, for example, deferring payroll tax payments or deferring income tax payments that were allowed by the CARES Act, all of that's been taken into account. I think we normally have a history of being very focused on working capital and focused on cash flow. When we come back to it though, the resiliency of the products and services, the growth and mobility, the growth in fiber, the strong performance in HBO Max, is all leading us to a better revenue stream situation such that I feel really comfortable about going to that 26 billion or better number. Now, there's still uncertainty. And so there's not a specific number we can pay. And quite frankly, we'll see how sales go in the working capital impacts of the iPhone launch, feel really good about that. But that's the basis for where we came up to it. All the pieces you mentioned are a part of that. You can look at the disclosures in the third quarter in the 10-Q to kind of get some of the specifics that you asked about [indiscernible]. But those are all taken into account. I feel good about dividend payout ratio in that high 50s rate. And quite frankly, in a pandemic here that's pretty remarkable. It's really as good as it's been in probably five or six years. So it's really a sign of a strong balance sheet, a strong business. On tax reform, quite frankly, the rate issue is obviously the increase in the rates could cause tax payments to go up. It's also a little [indiscernible] impact on bonus depreciation, the incentive for CapEx. We are certainly one of the larger, if not the largest, capital investors in the United States that generates a ton of jobs for our employees as well as for our suppliers\u2019 employees. So we're watching that carefully. That's probably a significant issue for the overall economy as well as for any individual company's tax treatment. Likewise, if you look at over the last 20 years, that's been supported by both parties, whether it be Democratic or Republican [indiscernible]. So we'll continue to follow it and we'll continue to follow, quite frankly, the infrastructure reforms whether they decide to include any of the broadband activity in there and whether we can \u2013 that would fit within our efforts to expand our fiber base and expand our footprint. David Barden : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : We're going to move to the next question. John Stephens : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yes, thanks. I'm actually going to follow up on something that John was just sort of alluding to because you talked earlier about the opportunity to drive higher penetration of the 14 million homes passed with fiber that you have already. But you know, this might be a slightly outdated statistic. I think there's something like 60 million customer locations in your landline region. So you're maybe only passing 25% of them today with fiber, which would imply you could meaningfully expand the availability of your fiber product in your addressable market, if you were to sort of step on the gas there. So what are the conditions that would encourage you to meaningfully expand that fiber footprint? Does it have to be something on the policy side or are there operating items you have greater control over such that you\u2019d be willing to meaningfully increase the fiber related CapEx? John Stankey : Brett, that\u2019s a good question. Thank you. I would tell you this. Obviously, winning policy in the country where it stands right now is attractive for investment and infrastructure and attractive for investment in fiber. And we think we've had the right kind of formula around that. And I would expect that if there is a new administration, there may be a lens put on that. They may want to put their pen to how they want to tweak it. And certainly there's some broader things that need to be done in this country, addressing some of the more hard to serve areas in the digital divide dynamics that make that a worthwhile thing for people to have discussion on. I would tell you, I don't think we need policy to get better. We just need to ensure that the policy doesn't whipsaw back to someplace that is inconsistent with incenting investment in infrastructure, because I believe right now there is to your point a large incentive for people to go and continue to put money into infrastructure investment, and we would be one of those to do that. I think good things come from that when we do it. We employ a lot of very meaningful middle class jobs that pay people well that come with benefits, that allow them to do great things in their lives and better their family's lives. And I think everybody from a policy perspective would look to that and say that's the exact kind of jobs we want. They're the ones that are good for this economy and good for people and have all the characteristics that nobody debase We want to see the American worker experience. What I would say from a perspective of step on the gas and what we are working on internally and what I've had the team focused on is, our company is in a very unique position of anybody that we compete with in our competitive set. We serve everybody from the smallest residential customer up to the largest corporation and everything in between. And we run, to your point Brett, one of the largest footprints that still has customers that want to connect to the network on a fixed basis. And so we should be in a very unique position for every trench foot of fiber that we put in the ground of putting more traffic on that fiber and monetizing it more effectively than anybody else, given the breadth of the customer base that we serve and the footprint that we serve. The retail mix that we have as well as the very robust fixed wholesale mix that we have in serving others infrastructure. And my belief, not my belief, I know that as a company, we probably have not squeezed the lemon out of that juice quite enough. And what I am trying to drive this business forward on is getting much more artful in our engineering to ensure that every trench foot of fiber that we're putting in, we are serving every segment we can serve as effectively as we can and we're not looking at our investment on a customer segment by customer segment basis, but we're looking at it as a transfer to fiber that we put in that has a bunch of different access technologies that hang off the end of it, sometimes it happens to be a millimeter wave site, sometimes it happens to be a big cell tower with four occupants on it that we sell wholesale into, sometimes it happens to be a strip mall where some of those customers want to be served with a fixed connection and some can get by with simply having a credit card reader attached to a wireless network. And sometimes it's a single family household. But we can be the best at doing that. And when I am confident that we are actually engineering and executing in that fashion, I will step on the gas with a way that I think everybody will look at it and say, those returns are so darn good, why wouldn't you do that. We've done really well in our investments thus far. Our consumer broadband business is a good business. Our wholesale infrastructure business is a good business. Our private network business that goes to the enterprise customers is a good business. But we're at this moment where fiber is the juice behind every single network that served this notion of wireless versus fixed is blurry more and more. The millimeter wave dynamic will drive to the integrated fiber network and we should be the leader in that space. And when I'm confident that we're engineering and operating that way, then I will be very, very robust in how I think about funding our business to do that. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. A couple of questions [ph]. Firstly, when you think about the fiber business, I guess the growth that\u2019s rising yesterday and growth that you guys reported today and then we also have some forward-looking guidance from the cable companies, which also demonstrates strong growth today. And we look at the overall broadband market, the penetration rates don't have a lot of room to grow overall across the entire market, but everybody is growing really fast. So, I guess, could you give us some color in terms of what the growth source is, if it's not coming from others in the industry? Is it things like people moving into vacation homes or a different level of occupancy? So if you could give us some color on the growth sources, that would be very helpful and of course with sustainability on the back of that? And secondly, I guess, the NFL is in the midst of negotiating all their rights. Could you give us some sense of what your priorities are with respect to sports rights and how you view that going forward? Thanks. John Stankey : Kannan, so first and foremost, we are a share taker and that's where a lot of our growth comes from. I think we've characterized for you that when we are 36 months into penetration on the fiber infrastructure we put in place, we move nearly 10 share points. And that's \u2013 we don't do that often in a product and that's one of the reasons why I think if we're smart about how we deploy more fiber and do it the right way, we think there's a strong economic equation here. And when you have a product that's perceived as being a better product from the customer base and I shared that with you in my opening comments about what our net promoter score metrics are for our subscriber base, that's a good place to be. That's what helps it. And certainly one of the dynamics that has helped the performance and the perception of our products in the COVID environment as we all sat around for a number of years talking about what is the killer app that drove upstream demand, because we knew the Achilles\u2019 heel of certain networks that have been built was restricted upstream bandwidth? Well, the answer is a pandemic. And the reality of everybody moving home and sitting on video calls all day, all of a sudden upstream bandwidth has become pretty important in homes and fiber, given its symmetrical characteristics, is great. And the dynamic around that I think has been incredibly helpful and I expect that our share growth and our opportunity to do well will come from the symmetrical nature of our architecture that we put in place. And then you can go through a whole bunch of other things that help it out, which is attractive bundling. You got a great wireless product that goes with it. You have an excellent product that sits on top of it that makes it attractive. All those things help our market effectiveness and we can get even more market effective if we have a little less of a patchwork in our fiber footprint. And it\u2019s what I said earlier that you shouldn't think about the next incremental homes we add as being similar to the previous homes, because we're now filling in areas where we already have people trained, we have a marketing presence, there's some footprint that\u2019s in place, the core central office equipment is already there. So you're literally just having the string fiber and connected to infrastructure that's already there and the investment to revenue return interval should be shorter. And so those are all good things around that. And then I would finally tell you, look, I disagree with you. I actually think there's a lot of unconnected households. There's a lot of unconnected apartments. There's a lot of unconnected single family homes in certain geographic areas of the city. That's why we have a digital divide problem. If you go into South Central Dallas, you're going to find a lot of unconnected living units that are there. If you go into urban Los Angeles, you're going to find a lot of unconnected living units that are there. I believe some of these architectures that are coming out, and frankly if policy gets right, that you can open up some of these places for growth. The universal service program gets reformed in an effective fashion, which I think it's time that from a policy perspective in our country, we should look at that. It makes fixed broadband more affordable than people who have made the utility decision to only have wireless in their household because it was good enough now may decide they want to go into the robust area of streaming and distance learning and choose to invest. And we have architectures now with things like millimeter wave that many instances could probably give different price points, attract those segments of the market that had been out of the fixed business with a good enough or reasonable enough broadband offer that I think also has some growth over time. On the sports side, I think I've said before and I don't think my point of view changes. Sports content is important to our linear business, our cable networks business to make sure we have enough of it that sustains that business and keeps it at attractive must-have offering, an offering that our customers want to have in that cable bundle. And we've invested in a way to make sure that that's the case and we like our properties. We like our engagement with the NBA. They're a great partner to work with. The demographic on the sports grade, they're flexible in their approach to things. I think our agreement with Major League Baseball allows us to adjust as viewership dynamics change over time, which is important because I think we're going to see platform distribution dynamics change over time, and they've been a good partner around that, I think will be a good partner moving forward. I think college and what we do with the NCAA in the tournament is just kind of one of those things that culturally is relevant. And I think our mix is really good in that regard. I don't see going deeper in sports is the direction for WarnerMedia. My view is we need to be partner at the right amount, but our goal is not to become known as the sports company. So I think we've been pretty disciplined around where we choose to get into it. We need to have the right amount in our portfolio. We feel pretty good about where we are about that. And I think that's probably enough in the near term. Our goal is to continue to get ourselves into a position where our on-demand platforms and our new distribution platforms, SVOD and AVOD, are scaled and our strategies on that right now, our general entertainment content. And you'll probably see as we move through AVOD, maybe we do some additional live work that we have coming forward that may not be sports centric. So more to come on that, but that's our near-term focus as we move forward. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Two if I could. First, I was curious if you could quantify some of the cost-cutting benefits in the third quarter and then size that opportunity of how it might flow through over the next one to two years? And then separately, one of the responses to the pandemic seems to be an acceleration of companies going digital and just software-based solutions. I was curious if you can unpack for the business wireline segment, how you think about those opportunities for AT&T to try to take advantage of that acceleration relative to some of the risks you may also have from legacy revenue and any lagging cyclical impacts as companies try to respond to the recession? John Stankey : Yes. So, Mike, let me \u2013 it\u2019s good to hear from you. I'll take the second part of that and then ask John to maybe round out the first part of your question. So, managing through the legacy wireline issues in our business segment, that's not anything new. In fact, I think I'd like to kind of declare we're on the downhill side of that issue. My point of view on what matters to our business subscribers moving forward is great connectivity and great infrastructure and more and more, it's a mix of what they need for their core networks matched with what they need for their wireless services. And not an insignificant part of our strength in our subscriber numbers have come from us marrying those two things together. We're doing much better in the wireless space on customers that we sell other network to. And I believe we have opportunity to do more. And it gets back to my point of view of where we put our fiber and how we deal with the midmarket and how we connect the midmarket to the core fixed infrastructure that they need to use for major parts of their business and marry it to the reality that all businesses are mobile in some way, shape, or form right now. I think that's our sweet spot moving forward and that's where our growth can come from, and that's where we have the team focused right now. And so I think the play in business is a core conductivity play. It gets back to my comments that we are in a very unique position, that if we put that fiber in because of the products and services that we have on core complex network connectivity that we do so well on with highly secure corporate networks, whether they be midsize or large, plus then what you pick up in the smaller segment of the market for unmanaged broadband connections that come off the back of that fiber mixed with our strength of wireless, that's a winning combination for us. And that's where we should be focused and in fact that's where we are focused right now. And that's what the enterprise organization is spending their time and energy on and how we're equipping our distribution, how we're setting up our distribution channels that both can sell wireless and basic fiber connectivity into these areas and that will be our meat and potatoes and what that business is built on. And I think that there's nothing more complicated about it than that. John Stephens : John, let me just add. Mike, to your question, we added close to 400,000 non-phone postpaid net adds. A lot of that were the kind of devices that business, education uses. And so we're seeing what you were discussing, we are seeing that aspect in our postpaid numbers already. Additionally, we had about 4 million connected devices and other connections in the quarter. So what you're referring to is happening today at different levels certainly of ARPUs, but we are very well connected. And the last thing I\u2019d say in on the FirstNet business that we have, a lot of the connections, the 1.7 million connections we have, some of those are those connected devices as opposed to just the phone aspect of it. So it's happening now and we're responding and I feel good about it. With regard to the cost cutting activities, let me just point out. We set a target of about $6 billion. We talked about that target last \u2013 beginning of the year and in October on a movement forward. We are continuing to work towards that goal. We've seen some immediate benefits already and John referred to it. Our review of our distribution capabilities are pushed towards digital, which is a more streamlined, simpler approach, improving the quality of that. The teams\u2019 made great progress that customers are happy with realigning our stores. We had the opportunity that we had two state mandates well over 1,000 stores closed that we made and we had a timing opportunity to adjust that and to shift some of that to authorized agents at a lower cost, relocate and close some stores to be very efficient. That's going on. We told you before that we had virtualized close to 75% of our network activities, we're continuing to do that. I can tell you my finance organization, we probably have on the new company combined have 125 or so systems we use and we've got a plan now to take out and reduce combined, consolidate probably two-thirds of those and we're starting on that. So those are the kind of flavor of the items we're doing. We're confident we're going to get there over the next few years. We've already gotten significant amounts of it through our organizational alignment, through our benefit efficiencies. But you can believe that we\u2019ll continue to do that. The best point I can make to you on these two things is these two were in the middle of the pandemic, we added 1 million postpaid customers and mobility. We had significant impacts on our roaming and our EBITDA was essentially flat. It does that because you do really good cost controls. I could tell you that same story on our business wireline. And look at those results in there EBITDA actually grew and margins grew. That's from these transformational efforts, really taking hold in the team, really doing a good job. I can't give you specific dollar amounts by categories. I have those, but we're not disclosing those. We're just working through this whole process. We got a lot more work to do. But the progress so far is encouraging. Michael Rollins : Great. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much. And we have time for one last question, operator. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Douglas Mitchelson : Terrific. Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in. For John Stankey, a few questions bundled together. I know the HBO Max initiative is a big initiative for you. If you can update us five months in on learning so far, engagement churn, the like? And if you can give us any context you're willing to around the international launches next year, how much of the world will be launched? And you mentioned the advertising-based service. I'm not sure if you're prepared to discuss how that will be different from the existing HBO Max? And then tailing onto that, if you don't mind, could you carry that into the state of play for the pay TV bundle? Given that in theory, the HBO Max initiative puts pressure on the pay TV bundle, but over at DirecTV and AT&T TV are trying to hold the bundle together. Do you see accelerating cord cutting in the future from the current 5% decline level across traditional and virtual MVPDs, given what you're doing and what you see and streaming across the industry, that would be helpful? Thanks so much. John Stankey : Sure, Doug. Let me see if I can kind of tick them off. So on Max, I would say absent the pandemic, the game is played out much the way we expected it to play out. The piece of the pandemic has put a little bit of a struggle on us. The customer acquisition game is an originals game. The customer retention game in that spot is a library game. Our library is performing incredibly strong relative to our customer base. In fact, we shared with you we had an objective of how many minutes a day we wanted the customer to engage with Max. We've well exceeded our expectations on that and it's on the strength of a library. And the best part about that is it's largely our owned library, what we already own the intellectual property on. It's not what we're releasing from others. I think in our top 10 library shows right now, there's one leased piece of content, maybe two that make it into the top 10. The rest is our own intellectual property. So the pandemic put us in a tough spot on originals. We didn't have the funnel. We were running the market and the pandemic got away with it. We couldn't finish a lot of the work that we had underway. It's that stream of new originals that allows you to kind of grow the customer base, and the team has done a really good job of doing that. I'm not disappointed. We're well ahead of what our initial plans were that we laid out for you a year ago in October. But nonetheless, we know we probably could have done better if we had the right kind of lineup of robust originals that we had originally slated, and that will now start to ease as production picks up. So, I would say everything is about where I expected it would be. There's some usability issues on the platform that we'd like to improve on the user interface. We made conscious decisions to launch with those to get time to market. Is software being written to improve those? And will you see every 45 days a new release coming out that will make the product even better and customers will see that occur? Yes. But that's just part of maturing and scaling a product and I feel good about the ramp. And once we think we've got those things online and have the right content, it's a good question to ask. Should customer acquisition pace increase? And I think we'd all like to see that happen when the formula is right. On international, as we shared with you before, our focus right now is on Latin America and certain parts of Western Europe. And so that's where you will see the focus in '21, as we roll out. Those teams are mobilized and working on that now. And just like we had a domestic U.S. launch, the same thing has to be put in place in all these countries to move forward. The subscriber counts that we gave you in October were consistent with what we thought would be our international gains coming from those regions, and we're still holding by those and have no reasons to be in any different place than we were before. AVOD will be an important feature add-on, because many of you write about the price point of HBO Max, which I will still maintain given the premium content is recognized by our performance recently in the Emmys that there are many customers that want quality, and they want to be able to go in and see something that has some depth in it, depth of seasons and we offer that. And as a result of that there's a segment of the market that's willing to pay for non-commercial driven, high-quality content. But there's a segment of the market that probably wants a lower price point. And AVOD not only allows us to broaden the offering, the amount of content we put on the platform, but it allows us to hit a different price point and attract different segments of the market and as a result of that we think that will be an important market expansion capability for us in accelerating our ability to attack different parts of the market. And frankly, it allows us to think differently about how we use other products and services on the platform, when you can use both subscription and advertising to support it. So it's a really important strategic issue for us to have an ability to use advertising in a scaled advertising play as a means to offer other products and services. And then your last question on the pay TV bundle, I don't know what the cord cutting rate is going to be over the next couple of quarters, so to speak. I expect that we saw a little bit of an uptick. I think a lot of that was driven by what I suggested earlier, which is when the virtual MVPDs got out of a highly promotional pricing game. There's the segment of the market that backed out at that point. We saw a little bit of that step up as a result of it. I've said before and I still maintain there's a certain number of sports consuming households that are going to be the stickier households in the pay TV bundle that when we kind of get down to that, 55 million, 60 million household range, we're probably going to see a little bit of a plateauing as a result of that. That doesn't mean that the bundle stays the way that it is. I think there will be a number of channels in the bundle that probably fall away over time and it gets a little bit thinner. But from my point of view, the reason we're doing HBO Max and one of the reasons that we expected walking in as we want to be where the customers want to be and we're focused on building a platform that\u2019s relevant for the next decade, and we have a great opportunity to pick those customers up to have a great opportunity to have both a subscription and an ad supported platform that we manage and we control that we have a direct relationship with the customer on where we not only do the distribution, but we own a large amount of the content that the customer is interfacing with. That is a good place for us to be strategically over time and we're leaning in to do that. And I'm more in tune with that being important to us and having a great and growing broadband business that complements it and that's whether it's broadband by fixed or mobile, that's where our business needs to be and that's the focus on what we need to do going forward. So with that, Amir, I'm going to wrap it up here. And I think we're done taking questions. First of all, thank you all for joining in today. I hope that you see that the business is demonstrating that they're working hard and they're executing with some great teamwork and that's yielded the performance in the market that you saw here. We're continuing to work on our efficiencies and our effectiveness. As John alluded to you, I think we're demonstrating that we can yield those and keep the cash flows coming in the way we expected. And we're plowing those strategically back into the market to make sure that we can continue to grow this business and be competitive. There is no reason that a customer shouldn't choose AT&T and it's our job to invest in this business in a way that we keep our customers with us and we can grow our base. And that's what we intend to do. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation as we move forward. We've done a great job in restructuring our profile. And as a result of that, we're going to continue to support the dividend and reinvest those free cash flows in a way that grow among those priorities I just talked about. So it's a tough environment, but I think we're managing well. We\u2019ve shown a great degree of resiliency. I have confidence we're going to get to the other side of this pandemic as we roll through next year. And we have the wherewithal to do that in a way that we can continue to invest in our business strategically. Thanks for being with us today. I hope the new format that we use today works for you. If you want to give me some feedback, I'm certainly welcome to take it to the extent that you want to give me some thoughts on that. Everybody stay safe. We'll see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I\u2019m Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. I also want to remind you that we continue to be in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 107. So, unfortunately, we can\u2019t answer your questions about that today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year to all of you, and I hope this moment finds you all in good health. With that, let\u2019s go ahead and get started on slide 3. There are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn\u2019t be nice to say in public, but when I look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, I keep coming back to one word, and that\u2019s resilient. We added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade and our highest value subscribers. We reduced churn, streamlined operations and have the nation\u2019s fastest wireless network. For the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers as customers moved to our higher speed services. And perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched HBO Max. And about seven months later, we have more than 41 million HBO Max and HBO domestic subscribers, two years ahead of the plan we shared with you in October of 2019. Our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. In fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. And on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next five years by about 50% and lowering our weighted average interest rate on debt to about 4%. We continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. Our cost cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward. In mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers and closed others. Total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base. We retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity. We took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work underway in our longer term operating model. We also realigned and streamlined our WarnerMedia operations to better deliver on HBO Max and the future of how consumers want to view content. Those are a few of our 2020 highlights. Let\u2019s talk about our 2021 priorities on slide 4. We have three priorities this year. Number one is straightforward, grow our direct customer relationships. That begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network. We\u2019ve had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last two years according to Ookla and the fastest nationwide 5G network in the second half of 2020 after our nationwide 5G launch. It shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio. Our fiber Net Promoter Scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. There is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides. Beyond our core connectivity services, we\u2019re focused on our goal to establish relationships with most U.S. households, and HBO Max is the key here. Through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities. Our second priority is the same as last year, and that\u2019s continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. We\u2019re restructuring businesses, sun-setting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs. As a result, we\u2019re positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company. Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We\u2019re committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we\u2019ll give top priority to debt reduction, at this time. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made the last two quarters. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we\u2019re seeing growth where we want to see growth, and we\u2019re successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. We have more work to do, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re on the right path. Before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that I\u2019m sensitive to the reality that there\u2019s much going on in and around the business. I know inside AT&T, we\u2019re working hard to reposition the Company. So, I can imagine you\u2019re working equally hard to keep up with us. To that end, I want to let you know, we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans, and we\u2019ll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. Look for more to come on that soon. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. John? John Stephens : Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Let me start on slide six with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it\u2019s been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones. Postpaid phone churn was the second-lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%. Our fiber momentum also continues. We added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. HBO Max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates. We added nearly 7 million total subscribers for HBO Max and HBO in 2020 alone. The trend of premium video declines continues to improve. If you exclude the impact of Keep America Connected on third quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row. Let\u2019s now look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75. That included COVID impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate and lower international roaming. Combined, COVID had an estimated $0.08 of EPS impact to fourth quarter, which we did include in our adjusted results. We\u2019ve made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our Entertainment Group results accordingly. In conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. As a result, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of $15.5 billion. Additionally, we adjusted for an actuary loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, stemming from the continued shutdown of theaters and film releases going on HBO Max. We\u2019ll provide more information in our SEC filings on our website and in our annual report. Revenues were down from a year ago, with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from WarnerMedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue, primarily in our Latin America segment. Cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. Cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020. For the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. Gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020, and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas, even during the pandemic. In addition, we invested about $800 million in HBO Max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year. Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on slide 8. Our Communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. We told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers, and you are seeing the benefits of that logic. Strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans help drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming. More than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. Churn has been impressive. The last two quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record, and for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis-point improvement in postpaid phone churn. Our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and an improved subscriber count make this the right economic trade. As I mentioned, we have split the Entertainment Group into two reporting units, broadband and video. And a full reconciliation of the two units is in our support documents. But for comparative purposes, here are the trends in Entertainment Group, the way you have been used to seeing them. We had our best AT&T Fiber fourth quarter net adds even with more challenges associated with the pandemic, and penetration continues to grow. It\u2019s now at 34%. In our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both, video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 5%. Our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amidst the pandemic. Solid cost management is the key to delivering solid EBITDA all year long. Let\u2019s move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on slide 9. WarnerMedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we\u2019ve seen across that entire industry. We did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of HBO Max. We now have 41 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of HBO Max later this year. And we now have more than 10 million customers who combined one or more of our connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO. Advertising revenues also grew driven by political advertising and CNN, which was number one in all of cable viewership, not just news in the fourth quarter. Because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique one-year plan in which Warner Bros. will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive one-month access period on HBO Max, simultaneous with the film\u2019s domestic release. Our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. That includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners and most importantly, the movie-going public. Our Latin America operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic. We added more than 500,000 subscribers in Mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in Vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in Brazil. Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by FX, slow economies and COVID. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. Now, let\u2019s go to slide 11 for our 2021 guidance. Last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. There remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery from the pandemic around the globe, impacting media, travel and employment. Against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. We expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in WarnerMedia\u2019s top line. As noted previously, we plan to reinvest all our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum in our growth businesses. Combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted EBITDA declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be stable with 2020. We expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net CapEx of about $18 billion. The primary difference between the two is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated FirstNet reimbursements. Free cash flow has been resilient for us, even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. We\u2019ll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. As John mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including Crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. We do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer term debt ratio target, once the auction quiet period ends. As 2020 showed us, things can change quickly. However, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. As John mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. Amir, that\u2019s our presentation. We\u2019re now ready for Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning. So, looking forward to the Analyst Day. Perhaps you could start with the macro environment. What are you assuming in terms of the backdrop is? Are you really assuming things continue to be much as they are, or do you have a pickup in the second half on things like roaming and advertising? Any comments just about trends with what CIOs are seeing, et cetera, that underscores that? And then, within the CapEx budget, are there any material changes within your priorities there, for example, your fiber build-out? I know that\u2019s a big priority. Is there an opportunity to ramp that up or additional spend on 5G rollout? Any color there would be great. Thank you. John Stephens : So, Simon, this is John. Let me take that. On the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was customers\u2019 willingness to pay. Our bad debts were really quite solid, quite positive trends, both on the consumer and the corporate side. So, while we\u2019re not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense. What we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next six months with some second half and really close to the fourth quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. So, we\u2019ll see more theatergoing probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year. We\u2019ll see some more travel, but in no way did we envision a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase. It\u2019s really much more of a general staying the course. There is some slight improvement but staying the course. Secondly, with -- the one thing I\u2019d add though is, the cash collections have been strong and have been resilient, feel really good about that. So, that gives us some comfort. Secondly, with regard to the CapEx, I\u2019d say, it this way. As you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it\u2019s up $1 billion. There\u2019ll be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., I continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite type side of the business, because of the success of AT&T TV and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross adds. There\u2019ll be some more money there. I think, you\u2019ll see us -- we\u2019ve continued to spend money on wireless, but we\u2019re well into and well completed with the FirstNet build. So, we\u2019ll have some ability to manage there. The next piece though is, we will see an increase in the fiber build and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. I don\u2019t know, John, did I miss anything from your perspective? John Stankey : Yes. I\u2019ll be more precise than John. We\u2019ll be building somewhere around 2 million fiber residential locations in that neighborhood. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve got the team tasked to do to give you a sense of what that increase will be. And I think the only other thing I would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that\u2019s occurring, we put a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with FirstNet upgrades. And there is a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless building. We\u2019re now moving away from what I would call capacity that\u2019s on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prefer possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. So, we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that\u2019s in the overall wireless program. John Stephens : Thanks for your question, Simon. Simon Flannery : Okay. CapEx -- okay. Is CapEx second half loaded then? John Stankey : We don\u2019t have anything that I would tell you is any different than what you\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re actually -- we started doing engineering -- if you\u2019re worried about fiber, Simon, we started doing engineering on the fiber build this year. I told you we were getting ready to go, and it was my intent to get going. And the teams are already out turning things up. We had the conversation last quarter. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber capable. The infrastructure is in place. We\u2019re going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. And as a result of that, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this. So, we\u2019ve got a little bit smoother dynamic around it than what you might think, because of the increase in the fiber dynamic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. John Hodulik : First, a related question. What\u2019s driving the 22% decline in the broadband segment? Were there additional costs associated with splitting it out from video? And sort of how do you expect that to progress through the year, especially with the increased fiber build you expect as we go on? And then, secondly, any update on the timing of the AVOD launch or anything you can tell us on new content or reliance on sports and news? John Stephens : John, let me take the first one with regard to the broadband piece. Quite frankly, it\u2019s really the efforts we\u2019ve had to increase our sales capabilities, add new customers, the amounts that we built out in the prior years. It also has to do with the recognition that we are providing HBO Max for all of our gig customers. And so, there\u2019s an intercompany charge there. It\u2019s within the umbrella of AT&T and the economics are there. So, we feel good about it. But, that\u2019s also in there. I would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure customer service like fiber is a long-term game, and we\u2019ve gone through the process many times, feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. But yes, we\u2019re going to be spending some money, as we did last year, to invest in that customer growth. You saw the 600,000 plus -- 650,000 or so net adds last six months. And we feel very good about that, particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction, the NPS scores. So, completely -- or completely support the fact. But yes, there is some investment there. With regard to the AVOD, we are expecting to launch our international version of the HBO Max later this year as well as the AVOD. I\u2019m not ready to give any dates. John, I don\u2019t know if you want to say anything more. John Stankey : We\u2019re still shooting for second quarter launch on AVOD. And I think, I would point out equally as important is the Latin America launch of HBO Max that we\u2019ve been working really hard on and be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on a unified platform and approach to things. So, you should expect, as we get into the second quarter, there is going to be a lot of activity and change going on here. One of the reasons we\u2019re kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we\u2019ve been working through pandemic-related production issues, and ramping that back up has been a pretty significant path. The team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely. It puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we\u2019re able to do. And there\u2019s a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. As a result of that, we\u2019re still fighting through getting the pipeline dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we wanted to. And the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycled back into production. Our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter. And it\u2019s really important as we put these new iterations to the product. We know that we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory. And so, as we\u2019re kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, John, we\u2019ll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what\u2019s coming out and exactly what month simply because it\u2019s just that tough, and that much of a battle literally show by show to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel, and we\u2019re working hard to do that. And we hope we\u2019re past any of the unexpected dynamics like the California closures that went on over the last several weeks that put a couple of twists and turns in the road, and we\u2019ve got the worst behind us. But, I\u2019m a little chased right now with everything on the pandemic. So, I don\u2019t want to overpromise anything. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hey guys. So much to ask. Thank you. So, in wireless, John, you talked about growing customer relationships overall as a priority for the Company. Should we assume that means the current level of promotion and upgrades that effort continues? And then, second, to follow up for John Stephens. Just really quick. You mentioned an updated leverage target that you had talked about in an Analyst Day. I know you can\u2019t really talk about where leverage goes around an auction. But, do you anticipate changing the target from the current 2.5 turns? Thanks very much. John Stankey : So Phil, the -- look, we\u2019re in a dynamic market. Things change all the time. We\u2019re going to look at our promotion strategies and adjust them accordingly, and determine what we need to do to continue to be in a position to maintain and grow share. And it\u2019s -- I think, it\u2019s really important that we continue to have a growing business. The management team is focused on two things. We like the momentum. I think, we\u2019d like to be a little bit more efficient with the momentum. We\u2019ve done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we\u2019ve been doing in the market. But, we\u2019re not self-funding all of it yet. And so, our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business, so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter. And we\u2019ve tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share. But, what I\u2019m turning back to the management team is a task that I\u2019d say is more aggressive. And to the extent that this management team delivers, and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters. Does that mean that, that\u2019s going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that I think is totally appropriate, bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want, going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our FirstNet abilities, using our deep enterprise customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base with affinity programs, ensuring that we\u2019re getting the mass market with attractive offers like HBO Max and what\u2019s associated with that, that is -- it brought in a really attractive gross add pool and treating our embedded base well, that is the strategy. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think you\u2019re seeing it, to be the industry leader in churn this quarter, I think we called it right. We said that we don\u2019t have customers that are upset about our network. They like it. We don\u2019t have customers that are upset about our service. They\u2019re satisfied with our service. We had customers who are interested in finding new devices. We shared with you that we had a little bit more agent population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. We\u2019ve been targeting how we do that. I think getting the new 30-year lease on life, the 30-month lease on life with these customers, I wish it was 30 years -- it\u2019s in a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now, given everything we have in front of us. John Stephens : Phil, with regard to the update at the analyst conference. First and foremost, what we\u2019ve said and we\u2019ll continue to say is free cash flow in excess of dividends is going to go to pay down debt. Proceeds from the sale of assets is going to pay down debt. The reality of it is we would prefer to be able to give you more information about a leverage target. We can\u2019t do that at this time because of the status of the C-band auction and our inability to comment on. That\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to tell you is that we understand that we would normally give it to you that would be appropriate. But because the FCC rules, we can\u2019t. So, we will commit that we will update it when it\u2019s possible. That\u2019s the story. I think, the one thing that I\u2019d repeat though is $27.5 billion last year, $26 billion, we\u2019re guiding for next year, $15 billion dividend, lot of money they\u2019re used to pay down debt. That\u2019s what the message we want to give you, and the proceeds from things like Crunchyroll going to use to pay down debt. So, we feel good about what we\u2019ve done over the last three years with regard to managing the debt, and we feel really good about our ability going forward. But, the comment about leverage is just, we feel it\u2019s appropriate for us to give to, we can\u2019t because of the rules around the C-band auction. Phil Cusick : Okay. So, that\u2019s a maybe this year leverage target, not a permanent changing the 2.5 leverage target? John Stephens : As I said, we\u2019ll give you all that at the analyst conference when we can talk about it, quite frankly. I just got to be really careful. We\u2019ll go from there and move forward. But, our guidance on this, the real piece is cash flow in excess of dividends and proceeds from asset sales go to pay down debt. And if you look at our net debt at the end of the year, I think, we\u2019ve shown a -- we\u2019ve got a good record to prove that we\u2019re doing what we said we\u2019re going to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : I just wanted to follow up on the wireless business, just with a couple of questions. So, with the guidance to grow service revenues at about 2%, can you frame the opportunity to improve ARPU for your wireless customers over the next 12 to 24 months? And then also with that target and given where the fourth quarter service revenue growth was, does that mean that AT&T may be exiting the fourth quarter of \u201821 with service revenue growth above that 2% for the whole year and relative to maybe where you\u2019re starting earlier in the year from? John Stephens : Michael, let me take a quick -- just a math point out, I think you\u2019re aware. But, the first quarter of 2021, this quarter, we\u2019re now -- last year, we still had international roaming. And so, that compare is going to be compared to, if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming. So, that will be one set. The next three quarters will presumably be without the international roaming. So, the numbers will be different. That\u2019s one. And I\u2019d just say that to you, so I don\u2019t want to get into quarterly analysis because I just don\u2019t want to confuse things we talked about the full year. Secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth. And quite frankly, we talk about the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid net adds last quarter, 1.5 million of voice net adds, mostly in the last six months, all of that. But the reality is too, we have close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year, when you include all connections. And, we\u2019re seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones John just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. And so, we\u2019re optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the service revenues. With regard to the ARPU growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer HBO Max, which has certainly got tailwinds behind it and the success of it. You saw the 7 million HBO adds, best we\u2019ve had in not only 10 years, but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. That is going to -- we believe that that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help and such that we\u2019re going to be able to grow it and then grow the ARPU from, getting people to buy up just from the mobile share plans and to unlimited, but the buy up for the basic unlimited all the way up to the elite. That\u2019s the story. We\u2019re not giving specific percentages, dollars, but that\u2019s what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth, which really drives the overall growth of the Company\u2019s 1% guidance on revenue growth. That and some tailwinds from the comeback of WarnerMedia. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And John, I guess, this is going to be your last quarterly conference call. So, we\u2019ll see you at the Analyst Day, but congrats on everything you\u2019ve gotten done. John Stephens : Thanks, David. David Barden : I just wanted to -- two questions. One is, separating out the video business, taking the $15.5 billion write-down is going to fan the flames of the conversation around divesting that satellite business. Could you kind of -- either John or John, could you elaborate a little bit on kind of what that might look like and what in the $26 billion of free cash flow guidance is coming from the satellite video business today? And then, the second conversation, we\u2019ve just finished the first month of the HBO Max experience with Wonder Woman commensurate with the theatrical release. And this is obviously going to happen like 11 more times over the course of 2021 as you kind of do the day date thing with the movie slate. If we multiply what happened with Wonder Woman times 11 over the course of 2021, what does that look like for Warner Bros. from a revenue and profit standpoint relative to what maybe 2019 would have looked like in a more normal year? Thank you. John Stankey : So, let me try to deal with the front end of that, David, and then, John can give you a little bit of context on the cash flow. Obviously, what I\u2019ll say on that is we assume that we\u2019re running the business as we portrayed it to you. And we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. And I think, part of this, when we step back and think about why we made this change is we figure we\u2019re at a life cycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines. And so, in the video case, we\u2019ve seen a pretty dramatic change in what\u2019s occurring in the market. And there is a variety of things driving it. You all know about the declines in the pay TV life cycle. But, we also have the dynamic that\u2019s starting to occur, which I think is a really important one to understand where we\u2019re starting to see pay TV disconnect a little bit from broadband as virtual MVPDs start up. Our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it. And, it\u2019s a fairly mature offering. And so, getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the life cycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively, I think, is a wise thing to do for that product on a standalone basis. And that\u2019s one driver behind why we made that decision. The second driver behind why we made this decision is, I believe we\u2019re at the front end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. And I think about our business being in a very unique position for both, businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise. And the innovation that\u2019s going to be necessary from a product perspective, and then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity, I think, is a new play. And that\u2019s a new growth for us. And to get them another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our business is how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we\u2019ve historically seen when we\u2019ve been bundling what I would call these high overhead, premise intensive visit-type services that we\u2019ve traditionally had in the bundle, and play into that is the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward. And that just makes sense for how we\u2019re operating the business because of the time and place and where we are. And we are absolutely comfortable that that\u2019s the right call for how to operate our business, moving forward. And I will tell you, I\u2019m not going to speculate on anything structural or M&A-oriented. We never do, and I\u2019m not going to now. But, I believe that what we\u2019re doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. John? John Stephens : Yes. Both the asset of video and both the asset of broadband is so critical going forward. John Stankey : Let me just quickly touch on the HBO Max and theatrical piece, if I could. So, I think, where we are is that there is a difference between what I\u2019ll call a tentpole release and a non-tentpole release. And Wonder Woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs that is different than the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. We have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule. They are going to be equally as buzzworthy as Wonder Woman. And we have in between those other high quality offerings that fill that in that cater to maybe sometimes a less broad audience. And that\u2019s the power of doing what we did in bringing the entire slate out to our end user base. So, we\u2019re going to see a little bit of spikiness in what occurs. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say if we\u2019re going to put, call it, 17, 18, whatever movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year. We\u2019re not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in December and early January every time we put a movie out, but that really isn\u2019t the design intent of the plan. We have -- but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base. And we\u2019re going to take every advantage of doing that. And we\u2019re going to work filling in the niche between it. I think, I want to stress, this is a unique year, and we did this as a unique year. And probably appropriate to make a comment that in some cases, I\u2019ll say maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little oversold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this from my point of view. We told you when the team decided to make this move that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time. And the team made the call, and I think it was a bold and aggressive swing. It was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. It was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. But, part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical movie-going audiences were going to look like in 2021. And since we articulated that, I would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that. I mean, just the last several weeks, you\u2019ve seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we\u2019re going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. And we don\u2019t believe that magically just because there is more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that that\u2019s going to dramatically increase the size of the movie-going population at that time. And so, as we indicated by making the write-off, we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively. And this was the right economic call that balances across both sides. And we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers that build out a scaled platform that allow us to have options on our distribution and using this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case. And I think, we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. I mean, nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. It was a pandemic. Just like nobody got on airplanes and nobody went to hotels and nobody goes to restaurants. And all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that. And the theatrical business had a little bit of dislocation. And I applaud the team for the move they made and trying to make the best of this circumstance for our circumstance around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product. Could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently and how we got through the front end of it? Any time you\u2019re first in something, there\u2019s no map. You\u2019re a trailblazer. There\u2019s nothing perfect for you to read. And I think that there\u2019s -- there were some things on the margin that maybe we do a little bit differently. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. And I think we know how to do that. I think we\u2019ve been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a planned and routine set of releases coming to them at a time when they really, as we\u2019ve talked about, have other studios snowplowing. I think, in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are bound to be there in a high anxiety environment, like the pandemic. And all things having been said with what we\u2019ve seen in the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. It\u2019s pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. So, John, why don\u2019t you go ahead and... John Stephens : Yes, and say a couple of things. One, I\u2019d point out first, almost from my perspective, 7 million net adds is pretty stout, and strategy worked. And secondly, it\u2019s still early. We\u2019re 31 days out from Wonder Woman\u2019s release I think. And so we\u2019ll continue to file it. More importantly, for everybody on the call, I think at the Analyst Day, we\u2019ll get the team. Jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about some of the further plans and go through that. Dave, your other question, I think, was with regard to the planning process. The guidance we\u2019ve given here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on C-band, is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of January 1st and owning them for the full year, other than Crunchyroll, other than the already held for sale termination of Crunchyroll. And so, yes, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. I won\u2019t give you a specific number on that, Dave. But, you can assume based on the results of the business last year, it\u2019s probably going to be a lower number, inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. But, it is a business as usual, what I would call kind of business planning approach. All that being said, feel really good about the free cash flow position. And particularly, as I mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year with regard to the fourth quarter, with regard to customer activity, both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side. And you guys can see it in our bad debts, which are remarkably low. Team did a really great job of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- and focusing on the best customers, and it\u2019s showing up in our numbers. So, I think, hopefully, that answers your question, David. Thanks for the earlier comment about my retirement. It will be a change, but it will be interesting. David Barden : Good luck. John Stephens : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to follow up on some of the fiber commentary. It\u2019s obviously encouraging to see that you\u2019re going to be picking up the pace of the build-out this year. But, even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint. How do you think about what portion of that footprint, which I think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a great demo and having economics to reach them that generate a compelling return for you? In other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? And am I even asking this question correctly? Because as you build out your 5G footprint, which is really a national 5G network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint. How do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? And maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country? Thanks. John Stankey : So, Brett, I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record, but it\u2019s really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally, so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year-over-year. If I think, about what has traditionally happened in outside plant access technology upgrades, I\u2019ve been through a series of them over my career. And I don\u2019t think this one is going to be a whole lot different. There is always the first third of the customer base that\u2019s kind of the low-hanging fruit slam dunk that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve. And it\u2019s like the no-brainer economically, and you kind of make your decision that that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to start. And I would say, we went through that largely through that first third in the investment we\u2019ve made over the last several years. Then what happens is as you get your -- up the learning curve, and the vendors start to scale and you start to get confidence in your economics and your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber, which is what you\u2019re going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we\u2019ve broken out for you as we move forward here over time, the next third becomes the opportunity. And we\u2019re into that segment -- the middle innings of the game, if you want. It\u2019s the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it that makes sense. Then you get into that last third, and it\u2019s always the hardest part. And I think, in many instances, you\u2019re still sitting with the last third that in parts of the rural America that still really don\u2019t have effective broadband options. And oftentimes, it\u2019s policy. Sometimes it\u2019s a technology breakthrough that gets that last third. And I would tell you right now, if you wanted me to prognosticate on are you going to build fiber to that last third, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to prognosticate that that\u2019s a place that we\u2019re likely to go in the near term. Absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place, I actually believe candidly even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented than the technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space. But, we\u2019re several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we\u2019ll have time to work through it. Right now working in the middle innings of the game, and the next 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. And as I shared with you on the previous call, it\u2019s 2 million this year. The team executes well, we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up. And when we demonstrate to the investor base, we\u2019re getting the kind of returns that you all like and you should cheer us on to do that and be very supportive of us moving down that path. And it\u2019s my intent to characterize that and show that to you. In terms of how I think about the wireless and fixed base, I\u2019ve got maybe a little different view on this, and I\u2019ll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. If you go back and you look at consumption that\u2019s occurred and customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric data use or fixed-centric data use, they\u2019ve all been growing. And they grow at a pretty consistent level. And if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what\u2019s going on inside the household of, for example, just one major trend of people moving away from what used to be broadcast or multicast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device. And you just look at what\u2019s happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast. It\u2019s going to drive a massive amount of consumption. And this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been about 10 :1 for many years. This is not new. And I got to -- I believe that that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10 :1, but there\u2019s still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. In other words, there is still a lot of traffic to be moved, given consumer shifts and how they\u2019re using products and services. And so, as I sit back and think about things, I think about hybrid access technologies has been important. But, I don\u2019t know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the four walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we\u2019re going to see over the next 10 years. And I think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. It doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some segments of the population. And my son, who lives on his own in an apartment in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that could work on an all wireless portion of his life in his 20s when he\u2019s independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household, and maybe that\u2019s a little bit different surrogate arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust wireless LAN inside of a managed dwelling unit. But, I still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward. John Stephens : John, the only thing I\u2019d add in your putting a fence around this issue, John made this comment earlier and it\u2019s really important. We have fiber-to-the-neighborhood in many, many locations, and taking fiber-to-the-home is the second step. We haven\u2019t done that yet. So, if you think about our VDSL, if you think about our new greenfield builds, if you think about the neighborhoods next to the VDSL, there was next to where we\u2019ve got fiber-to-the-prem, those are the opportunities. And that VDSL footprint is 35 million. And when you add the fiber to it, it\u2019s greater than that. That will give you kind of a framework for something that we could efficiently do just what John said about building out the 2 million this year. That\u2019s where a lot of the focus is going to be. So, I think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us. And yes, we have that ability. We need to continue the sales momentum. That\u2019s going to be really critically important to make it work. But in line with that that\u2019s I think a focus of easy capability for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Can you comment on any potential regulatory changes with Title II potentially coming back over the next 12 months? And can you give us a little bit more detail on -- as far as the fiber-to-the-home? You say you\u2019re doing another 2 million homes this year. To what extent can we expect that to continue at that sort of pace, or is that just sort of a year-by-year kind of a decision? John Stankey : So, I said in the neighborhood of 2 million homes. I would tell you that, as I just said, Frank, I want to be able to demonstrate to you that that 2 million pace is a no-brainer and a slam dunk and a great value driver for our business and a great subscriber count driver for our business. And I think, this business can build more than 2 million in a year in a very profitable fashion. But, we\u2019re going to demonstrate to you we can do that and then we\u2019ll come back to you and tell you about what that rate is. So if we execute well, when the management team execute well, do I expect that I\u2019ll be back talking to you about a 22 build that maybe lean in heavily to that? That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see the management team step up to and be able to work its way through. Where I think -- I\u2019m sorry, the first part of your question\u2026? Frank Louthan : Title II. John Stankey : Oh! Title II. How can I forget? Look, I think, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re now back into the wood-saw approach of the new administration and a new belief that despite four years of not a single data point to suggest that we have a problem to solve, nobody blocking anybody, nobody throttling anybody, nobody bought -- doing anything inappropriate in terms of use of service and disclosing how they\u2019re offering services to customers, we\u2019re going to go through another regulatory bloodletting over this. I expect it to happen. And we\u2019re going to watch the cycle repeat itself. And, one would hope at some point that there\u2019s a recent discussion around a policy that gets us away from this web sign and allows everybody to kind of have a more consistent and stable approach. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019re certainly going to try and push and discuss it. Where I think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. And if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where competitive markets exist, then I think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be okay. But, if for some reason, policy goes down a path if that isn\u2019t the case, it hasn\u2019t in the past, even when Title II is in place, we have the latitude to do what I felt like we needed to do. But if, for some reason, policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist, I have to step back and ask ourselves how we\u2019re allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it\u2019s the right place for us to go for our shareholders, based on that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away. So variable, I\u2019d say, in the market, not lever. So that\u2019s how I think about it right now. I actually step back and from a policy perspective, ironically, think about what\u2019s happened over the course of the last year or two, and the dynamics that are going on right now where the issue is looking at metering and monitoring speech and what\u2019s occurring for people\u2019s access to platforms, that -- there are more real and significant data points and how that\u2019s affecting society than anything to do with how internet service providers are delivering bandwidth in the homes. But, I\u2019ll leave it to smarter people to meet and figure that one out. John Stephens : Frank, I think we\u2019re -- the industry is real proud of what\u2019s happening in the course of the pandemic and the way we\u2019ve allowed people to continue to work from home. I\u2019m sure many of you are taking this call from home. And the industry, the investments they\u2019ve made under the prior union regime is working. We\u2019re as a company more focused on broadband, not just the availability because it\u2019s out there, but people\u2019s actually taking advantage of it for the home work situation for others. And we\u2019re working on those aspects, as well as following all the other aspects of a infrastructure bill, another stimulus bill, tax legislation. We\u2019re following all those things, right? So, we\u2019ll continue to follow as closely, as you can imagine. Amir, can we take one more question? Amir Rozwadowski : Yes. We\u2019ve got time for one last question, operator. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. John, I know you said the move to virtualization of content is kind of accelerating, and that seems to be happening with gaming, compute, even communications with Microsoft Teams and Zoom. How are you positioned to take advantage of that? Are you better positioned as a company that owns the pipes and some of the content, or do you think it makes more sense to separate these assets, or you\u2019re in a really unique seat? I mean, how do you really take advantage of this accelerating move at this point? John Stankey : Tim, our biggest and single most important bet in that regard is HBO Max. And I think about that broadly is, while today, we talk about it as an SVOD evolving to an AVOD offer. I\u2019ve mentioned this before. I view it as a really important foundation for broader customer relationships. I mean, this is the first big foray of maybe legacy AT&T thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point SKU that isn\u2019t exclusively dependent on infrastructure. And to the extent we are successful at having that relationship with most U.S. households, if we don\u2019t use that as an opportunity as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities, either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we\u2019d be losing a huge opportunity. And so, I think there is all kinds of things we want to do around the edge and making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure, so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. That\u2019s all important and that\u2019s all meat and potato stuff we need to do on a network. But, I think about owning some degree of engagement with the customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, I think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. And I know, it\u2019s longer term in nature, and I\u2019m well aware of the folks who have maybe a tighter orientation to financial return, question, why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area? It\u2019s because I feel pretty strongly about that. And I think building large subscription basis of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of the hallmark of this business. We have a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. We need to evolve that into what the next step is. And this is just one of those steps in making that happen. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Tim. That\u2019s all the time for questions that we have. And with that, I want to turn it over to John Stankey for final comments. John Stankey : So, I have one last order of business before I let you go, and Dave kind of hinted at it with his complement to John. I do want to point out that it\u2019s with very mixed emotions that we recognize that this is I believe John\u2019s 40th and last earnings call that he\u2019ll be doing with all of us. And he\u2019s been a very-valued and long-time coworker of mine. I think, if you think about the fact that he sat in this role as CFO of this Company for nine years, that speaks volumes in and of itself about his character and abilities. That\u2019s a tremendous level of longevity for somebody who occupies a role as significant, as pressured and as dynamic as the one that he\u2019s had. I\u2019ve worked with John for 23 years of his career, which has been a long time, and it\u2019s been a pleasure all along the way. I could say a lot of things. Obviously, high integrity, high impact, high functioning and incredibly high regard as a person. We\u2019re going to miss him at AT&T. I know you\u2019re going to miss him in support of all of you, but we\u2019re delighted about what lies ahead for him and his family and Michelle on his next chapter. And as you would expect, the professionalism and navigating the handoff to what\u2019s going to be a very capable successor. I\u2019m just delighted to have Pascal coming in, and look forward to all of you getting to know him. It\u2019s gone incredibly smoothly. It\u2019s been first rate. And I think as we join you a quarter from now and Pascal takes the reins, you\u2019ll see what a nice, smooth and even keel transition that\u2019s been when we reconvene. So, I hope you join me in giving best wishes to John in his next chapter and thank him for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you, John. John Stephens : Thanks, John, and thanks for the kind words. Thanks to all the other members of the management team here who\u2019ve been a family for me. Specifically, thanks to my team, the finance team, just remarkable people across the board. Pascal is going to do a great job, and you guys are going to be thrilled we\u2019re upgrading. And I would tell you, I just want to wish everybody on the call good luck, Godspeed, stay safe. And remember, don\u2019t text and drive. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I\u2019m Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T\u2019s SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s been about six weeks since our Analyst and Investor Day. So the framework for what we\u2019ll cover today will be familiar to you. We have a consistent, deliberate and clear approach to the way we run our business. From our market focus areas to our 2021 priority to grow customer relationships with most U.S. households across these market focus areas to our capital allocation plans. As you see in our quarterly results, our execution has been sharp and we have momentum. We continue to grow our customer relationships with strong subscriber growth in mobility, AT&T Fiber and HBO Max. We also continue to invest both in capital spending and in content. Our ability to drive costs out of our business and deliver strong cash flows has allowed us to invest in strategic growth. However, as you can see from the results, we\u2019re investing wisely. We\u2019ve been deliberate and intentional in allocating dollars that about generate returns. This supports the future of our business while also optimizing the returns on strategic opportunities across our portfolio. For example, cost transformation efforts in mobility yield improved year-over-year profits while we simultaneously invested to drive customer growth. Same at WarnerMedia where EBITDA was down slightly, even with significant increased investment in HBO Max. The restructuring and consolidation of our WarnerMedia business is driving cost savings in our studio operations, networks, sales force and technology. Our transformation initiatives across the Company are driving efficiencies and freeing up capital to invest in our growth areas and there is more opportunity ahead of us. Our deliberate capital allocation plan allowed us to invest and sustain our dividend at current levels, which we believe is attractive. We\u2019re prioritizing cash after dividends to reduce debt. We continue to monetize non-core assets as we refine our overall business focus, as you saw us do in the quarter with our announced sale of a controlling interest in DirecTV and our other video assets. Let\u2019s look at the progress we made in delivering on our market focus areas on Slide 4. Our customer growth was impressive across mobility, fiber and HBO Max and we\u2019re doing it the right way with a focus on growing profitability. In mobility, we added nearly 6,000 postpaid phones in the quarter, our best net add first quarter in more than ten years. Our subscriber momentum is strong and we\u2019re taking share. Gross adds are up and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago. Our transformation program is enabling us to be competitive. At the same time, we\u2019re benefiting from a simplified go-to-market strategy and optimize sales and distribution channels. Mobility EBITDA was up more than 2% and service margins increased 100 basis points despite a 2020 first quarter compare where roaming revenues were largely unimpacted. You put it all together, and I believe this demonstrates the formula works. AT&T Fiber net adds were strong and penetration levels continue to expand. We\u2019ve added more than 1 million fiber subscribers in the last four quarters. IP broadband revenues grew nearly 5% in the quarter, and we\u2019re on pace to build out fiber to another 3 million consumer and business customer locations this year. HBO Max continues to deliver strong subscriber gains fueled by the success of our day-and-date theatrical strategy, and are steadily strengthening post-COVID content slate. In the U.S., we\u2019ve added more than 11 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers in the last 12 months. It\u2019s a premium offer with a premium ARPU compared to other streaming platforms and subscription revenues in the first quarter grew about 35% globally for WarnerMedia\u2019s direct-to-consumer business, and we\u2019re on track to launch HBO Max internationally and introduce an AVOD product in June. Across the board, we\u2019re encouraged by our momentum and how our management team is executing against our singular priority to grow customer relationships in our market focus areas. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the specifics of our first quarter results. Pascal, welcome, and the floor is yours. Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin with our consolidated results on Slide 6. We started the year with growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. Revenues were up from a year ago with gains in mobility and WarnerMedia more than offsetting declines from video, legacy services and FX. As a reminder, our Communications segment has been recast to exclude our video business. For the quarter, Communications EBITDA was essentially flat with the prior year. That demonstrates a marked improvement from the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.86, that\u2019s up more than 2% year-over-year. We also had a good start to the year with our cash flows. Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion with higher sales of receivables, lower CapEx and interest. Our dividend payout ratio was about 63%. CapEx was $4 billion, gross capital investment was $5.7 billion. In addition, WarnerMedia\u2019s total cash content investment across all their business this quarter was $4.5 billion, slightly higher than last year. As we indicated at our Analyst Day, we are investing in our market focus areas and we\u2019re seeing further validation of our strategy in the first quarter results. Therefore, we edged up our gross capital investment expectations to the $22 billion range for the year. Additionally, we increased our expected vendor financing payments given our ability to negotiate favorable terms. Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on Slide 7. Mobility continues to lead the way in our Communications business. We saw strong customer growth in our postpaid phone base, growing service revenues, growing EBITDA with expanding EBITDA service margin and that\u2019s with continued headwinds facing our high margin international roaming business that we estimate cost us about $100 million in EBITDA this quarter. Our simple direct postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. And as John mentioned, our mobility gross adds share is increasing and postpaid phone churn has stayed near record low levels. Cost transformation continues to be a big part of the story for mobility. Our more efficient, sales processes and streamlined operations are driving down costs. In fact, our average promotional spend per net adds is significantly lower than a year ago. Our cost efforts are also evident in business wireline. Cost management has helped expand EBITDA margins as customers transition away from higher margin legacy services and products. But the product simplification and the resulting cost savings have been key to delivering solid EBITDA. Consumer Wireline is another business in transition. We are moving quickly to expand our fiber footprint and our results show you why that is crucial. We added 235,000 AT&T Fiber customers in the quarter. IP broadband ARPU grew 3.2% year-over-year. Our fiber penetration rate is more than 35% and growing, and total broadband net adds also increased. We expect this to be the trough in terms of year-over-year EBITDA growth. We expect trends to improve from here, driven by IP broadband revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the year. Let\u2019s move on to WarnerMedia, which is on Slide 8. WarnerMedia results are the first chapter of what we expect will be a transformational year for the business. Revenues were up nearly 10%, higher direct-to-consumer subscription and advertising revenues drove the growth and even with higher customer acquisition and content costs associated with HBO Max and higher sports costs EBITDA was down only slightly. Advertising revenues were up more than 18% driven by return of sports, especially the NCAA Championship Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenues grew about 35%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. We now have 44.2 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and nearly 64 million worldwide subscribers. Average monthly revenue per domestic customer is just a little less than $12. And now we have 11 million customers who combine one or more connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO. The same day release of movies in theaters and on HBO Max has been a success. It has provided theaters with a steady flow of content in a pandemic challenged environment. And it has also been a great catalyst for subscriber growth at HBO Max. The success of Godzilla vs. Kong at both the box office and on HBO Max bears this out. It had the largest domestic box office of any other movie in the last year, while also having the largest viewing audience of any other film or show on HBO Max since launch. And films such as Godzilla vs. Kong attract new retail customers who are staying because they enjoy other content on the platform. We\u2019re really looking forward to the introduction of our international and AVOD products planned for HBO Max later in June. We plan to have attractive price points for our AVOD offering and we expect to lean into our international launch reaching 60 additional markets by the end of the year. Our aim is to use our differentiated premium content offering to attract global customers Now let\u2019s go to Slide 9 for an update on our capital allocation and liquidity. We made our $23 billion C-Band spectrum payment since we last talked to you in March. That drove net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.1 times. We expect this will be our peak leverage level. We\u2019re still on track to have a sizable reduction in debt by year-end through a combination of strong free cash flows and proceeds from asset monetization. We\u2019ll continue to focus on debt reduction. We expect our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be around three times by year-end. We also continue to actively evaluate other asset monetization opportunities. Our treasury team has also been working tirelessly to lower our cost of debt. Our weighted average cost of debt is down 50 basis points year-over-year, driving about $150 million in lower interest costs in the first quarter. Our weighted average maturity for debt is 16 years at a weighted average cost of 3.8%. About 90% of our debt is at a fixed rate. So we feel we\u2019re well protected in an increasing interest rate environment. Amir, that\u2019s our presentation. We\u2019re now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe two questions on the WarnerMedia side. You've got 64 million total HBO Max subs and the AVOD and international launches coming later this year and obviously some momentum. So it's certainly more than we thought in the first quarter, I mean, is the 67 million to 70 million guide for year end, does that need to come up? And if not, why do you expect to slow down? And then maybe for Pascal, I mean, you mentioned some of the drivers, but we expected a double-digit decline in WarnerMedia EBITDA this quarter despite get driven by all the content investment in HBO Max. Can you give us some more color on some of the drivers that kept that EBITDA essentially flat? And is that a trend that we can expect through the year even as the investment ramps? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Thank you for your question, John. A couple of things to keep in mind. First, as it relates to our guide, we provided our guide on Investor Day. And obviously, we're really pleased with how the business is performing, but at this time we're not going to update our guides beyond what we've said already, but we are really pleased with the performance. And I think what you're seeing is we're putting out a really good product and consumers are responding. In terms of WarnerMedia overall, here is a thing to focus on. We've mentioned this several times, but over the course of last several years, there has been a consistent transformation effort taking out duplicate costs across the organization. So we have a combined technology organization, sales function, content production studios. So all that is what you're seeing coming through is offsetting the investment that we are making in HBO Max. That was the plan, that was deliberate and that's what we \u2013 that was our objective and it's coming through. In terms of going forward, I am not going to comment on what the exact trends are going to be, but again, you should keep \u2013 we have significant transformation savings that should help subsidize some of the investment we're making. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks, Pascal. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we can go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line \u2013 hold on one second. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, can we get to that, move to the next question then. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Thanks so much. Maybe two, if I could. John, you talked at the Analyst Day about the prospect of accelerating the fiber investment based on the success rate that team had in deploying against the opportunity that they were presented with the 3 million passing this year, potentially as many as 4 million next year. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing on the ground relative to your expectations? And how the recent price changes in the fiber business factor into that game plan? And then I guess the second question for you Pascal. You effectively lowered your CapEx guidance by boosting your plan to take advantage of vendor financing, but you kept the free cash flow guidance the same implying lower operating cash flow from a quarter ago. Could you elaborate a little bit on how we kind of square that change in the guidance with what looks like relatively strong performance this quarter? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Dave, let me start with the CapEx question then I'll turn it over to John. Here is the context to keep in mind. Our first quarter performance was really strong. And typically as you know, this is the low watermark for free cash flow delivery. And so, we're really pleased with how the business is performing and the customer momentum, rest assured. You should not read into this any more than it is. When we looked at our projections for capital spend, we thought it was appropriate to increase it, but we didn't think at this time we have given however it is, it was appropriate to start to change guides. We wanted to maintain some flexibility, but we are really comfortable with our free cash flow guidance and it has not changed in any way as a result of the change that we've made to CapEx. So there's really nothing more to it than that. John Stankey : I'd tell you Dave just to kind of maybe put a finer point on what Pascal said. One of the things I'm trying to impress upon with the management team is we want to do things in the right way, and we want to do things in a sustainable way. And I have probably a little bit of a cultural shift. We have a very process-driven organization that's very focused on delivering what we ask them to do, and that's a great strength, but sometimes that means that people are very literal about looking at a number and saying, I will get you that number and maybe don't \u2013 raise the point that says, if you gave me a little bit of flexibility, I could do something a lot more efficiently or effectively for the next two years. And I'm really trying hard with the management team to help them understand they have the latitude to do the right thing for the long haul and that while we want some consistency in how we run the business, there is a limit to doing that with the de minimis returns or diminishing returns. And so with that, I got to back up what I say to folks and when they come in and they have compelling ways to think about how we should build or go about deploying, I need to be responsive and ensuring that I give them the latitude to do that. And given the number of things we have underway that we're scaling, including fiber build, as you asked the question of what we're doing around starting to roll into 5g deployment, et cetera making sure that we get that latitude in there is really important to me. And I think it's important to supporting them. And what I'm seeing on the early days of \u2013 I won't even call it the early days, what I know about our base on our fiber deployment and what we know about the incremental work is it's from an operational perspective and a market perspective all green lights. That's one of the reasons why I'm really comfortable in letting the team run in the way that we're letting the run. And I like what I see in terms of our market position. If you look at things like customer lives, churn, customer satisfaction and net promoter scores and the actual performance of the product, they're all great. And when you start looking at that, there is going to be goodness. And I've told you just before, I've not seen share movement on typical products like this as rapidly as we're able to get share movement once we deploy an area. And I frankly have never seen customer satisfaction levels move up and get to a promoting position in the market as we've transitioned to product as fast as we're seeing. I think both of those things bode really well. And as you heard Pascal talk about in the opening remarks, we think we're at kind of the bottom of our EBITDA compare. A lot of that is actually being driven by our strategy to a start attaching content, the broadband. That's been really good in terms of driving those customer lives up. It's driving churn down. It's driving engagement and satisfaction levels higher. We're going to get the benefit of that over the customer life cycle. And as we start to lap that, you're going to start to see \u2013 our EBITDA dynamics start to creep back up to where we want them. So I feel really good across the board. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much David. Operator if we can, move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Good morning. John, can you talk a little bit about the plans for the C-band spectrum? What are you doing in the marketplace today? When do you expect to get the initial markets rolled out? And is that what's the extra billion dollars is going on? Is that part of the 6 billion to 8 billion you're called out? So any updates around the timing there would be great. And I think you just mentioned on CNBC around your interest in the 3.45, perhaps you can expand on that. Thanks. John Stankey : So Simon, we gave you the POPs coverage guide at the Analyst Day, and we haven't changed any of that now even within \u2013 without changing the pace and rate of where we are on C-band deployment, which will begin turning markets up late this year. That doesn't mean that in things that we're doing today that can help the 2022 build that we wouldn't make some decisions on deployment. And that is an aspect of some of this the capital dynamic we described, but it's not the aspect. There are a variety of things that are playing into it. That's one of several. And so as we time certain things, the aggregate amount may be the same, but there is things that we can do today is we're touching towers and doing things in parts of the infrastructure. That, for example, maybe aren't going to be in service until later in 2022 that we could do a little more efficiently to pre-provision some things and not go back and touch them a second time. So, some of that ordering is a dynamic that we're trying to drive through. As I've told you, I don't expect that there is going to be any change right now on our deployment plans and the growth from the guidance that we gave you five weeks ago. We'll see as we get into this a little bit deeper. As usual, we're in that cycle where technology is relatively new, vendors have commitments. We're waiting on specific units. Global supply chains are stressed right now across the board. And you asked the question and you do the work and people will give you comfortable answers, but I'm a little skittish. I mean, we're seeing dynamics that are occurring in the global supply chain where unexpected things are popping up. And is it possible that we could see certain element shortages that start to crop up as everybody is racing to put stuff up on towers in May. And that's why I want to be a little bit cautious around guiding up or doing anything different until we get a little bit momentum around that. In terms of where we are on the 3.45 end of year DoD auction, look I believe that there could be an opportunity there. We're going to watch it carefully. We've always participated in any spectrum auction that comes forward or looked at it and said does it make sense for the portfolio. And we can see some things that if the valuations are sound valuations, that make sense for our business. I will tell you in the guidance we've provided you over the next several years we have plugged in an expectation that we will be in spectrum markets as we guide down to our 2.5 debt to EBITDA level that we projected for you in 2024. And so I expect within that plan, we're going to be looking at it and saying do we like the valuations and does it make sense? And we do believe some of that spectrum could fit into our network portfolio and be helpful to us down the road if the auction is done and the way we think it's going to be done. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Simon. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Two questions, if I could. First just curious if you could share more details on the customer engagement levels that you're seeing on the HBO Max platform to gain a better understanding of how customers are using the platform after the initial reason to purchase the service or activate onto the application. And then secondly, I'm just curious if you could also provide some context on the customer verticals that are contributing to the improvement in the wireless postpaid subscriber growth and if you're seeing any impact or change to your growth or growth expectations from some the recent promotional changes of your competitors. Thanks. John Stankey : So, Mike, let me give you kind of \u2013 we're not going to give you any more guide publicly on the hours of engagement than what we gave you at Analyst Day. I don't want to get into kind of every five week update on those numbers. I think we gave you a good sense of what's happening and our satisfaction that we're well up over two hours per day per account. And I think that's a really good place to be, and it certainly is probably higher than our engineered expectations when we launched the product and we'll take that goodness. The behaviors of what customers are doing really I don't think are dramatically different than what you would see on any other SVOD service. As Pascal mentioned, we clearly have a good reason for them to come in and we're seeing in the customer data that many are opting to come in because of theatrical slate opportunity and credit to the team. They've done a remarkable job, not only of engineering that strategy and executing it, carrying it through, and it's playing out exactly as we kind of laid out for you. When we said we wanted to do it in terms of the mix, we've got more of the year to get through to see what that balance is between theatrical revenues versus SVOD. But when you look at the customer growth on SVOD and you see some of the early data coming back on movies like Kong versus Godzilla in the theater. I think you can all see that there is probably a pretty compelling rising tide lifting all boats in this case. And we feel it was the right call for the moment we were in with the pandemic and really comfortable about that. And that drives customer exploration of the product. And once they come in, they do what they do with any other SVOD service. They go to our high value series. So any of the new scripted series content that we have out there, HBO originals, HBO Max originals, they go for the high profile ones and they start to engage on those and then guess what else they do. They dig deeper into the library. And there is workhorses in the library, depending on the demographic of the individual that tends to sustain them around. And because of the good job of marketing the slate for the movies, I think what we're seeing is evidence that they say, well, gosh, I'm now into it two, three weeks, and I know there is another one coming next month that I want to see I'm sticking around. And so our churn expectations have been consistent with what we expected moving in. And so, I think, it's just the classic approach to managing any SVOD service, although we're playing to our strengths and how we're tiering the content, and we're using theatrical maybe a little bit more heavily than other services might use because that's one of our strong suits. And it always has been with the strength of HBO and the theatrical slate that HBO offered in the core product. On the wireless side, I've said this before, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but part of our strength is that we're really able to cover the waterfront on some of the verticals in our distribution strategy. And in particular, we've been particularly strong in using our enterprise business and our business sales force and not only selling into business segments, but ensuring that affinity plans in those areas can reach customers and their families at home for being part of that business that we sell to. The strength of FirstNet, which has opened up a vertical that we were under indexed in and share, and we're seeing really attractive share growth. And again, there's an affinity characteristic that occurs within that vertical. It's not only an affinity characteristic among coworkers, but we've managed to ensure that if somebody chooses to come on for the purpose of their work as a first responder that they have a lot of incentives to maybe drag their family through that experience with attractive pricing and approach. We continue to be strong on our traditional verticals with our iOS centric customer base, which tends to scale what I would call the better part of the postpaid market. And we haven't lost any edge there. In fact, we've done a little bit stronger. And I would tell you, I think we still have room to run. I think we're probably under-indexed in a couple of verticals, especially if we start looking at the Hispanic community that we can do a little bit better in and how we position our brand and our product and the team is focusing on those areas. So, my point of view right now is our momentum is continuing. We're doing better. As you can see from the results, we still have a couple of cards to play to try and sustain that. We've been very consistent in the market with a repetitive offer quarter after quarter. You're correct. We have seen our competitors continue to try to compete aggressively. They're mixing and changing their offers pretty frequently. We seem to be very consistent and very stable, and that's a really good place for us to be, and we're going to continue to play our game. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Thanks. John, following up on wireless, you talked last year about investing in the base. How do you see the upgrade in retention outlook for the next few quarters? You've upgraded a lot of the base. Do you think there is just less need for new phones going forward? And second for Pascal, I believe with lower churn, you extended the life of wireless customers. Can you give us an idea how much that may have helped wireless EBITDA year-over-year? John Stankey : Yes, Phil, it's hard to predict exactly where the ebbs and flows of the subscriber base goes. It's been fairly consistent and I expect it's going to remain pretty much on this pattern. The pattern that we would expect given it was a new device launches. It tapers off a little bit in the middle part of the year after you get through the bubble immediately following a new device launch. And then as you get into the second part of the year and you get into the holiday season, it'll kick back up. But as I said, we have given you guidance that we think is consistent with the volumes that we're experiencing right now. We're really comfortable with where we're at. As we told you, you're going to see service profitability bounce back, and you're seeing EBITDA grow in the segment. We're very comfortable we'll continue that trajectory. So I'll take the customer growth and we can get that dynamic moving the direction it's at. I feel really good about it. I don't think I'm going to guide you to suggest that there is going to be any dramatic shift one way or the other over what you're seeing right now on our direction. Pascal Desroches : And Phil a couple of points, first just to follow-on John. The thing to keep in mind is look we saw not only the customer momentum, we saw revenue gains as well as profitability gains in mobility. So the strategy is working and we feel really good about it. As it relates to your question on customer lives, here is the context. Overall, this is something we do on a regular basis. We change lives of assets based on the most recent information we have. The net effect of changing lives this quarter was slightly negative to earnings. For wireless, it was positive. For Consumer Wireline, it was positive, but for DIRECTV assets, it was negative. So, on balance, it was negative and it was not significant by any stretch and we've disclosed that in our 8-K. Phil Cusick : Make sense. John Stankey : I think you'd expect to see a little bit of an extension of wireless lies with churn taking the direction it's taking, you know, seven handles on post-paid churn is rarefied air. Phil Cusick : Yes, I agree. Pascal, if I can follow up on a question earlier. I'm just getting a lot of incoming that where people are of two minds. Can you spoon-feed us on the free cash flow versus increased vendor payments versus CapEx? I think there is a lot of misunderstanding about what are you spending and that's this year, what are you paying back for in previous years? And you mentioned also something about higher confidence so higher spending as well. Can you just go deeper in that? Pascal Desroches : Phil, as you know, we have a metric out there, a non-GAAP metric that's called gross capital investment. That is the sum of cash that we pay for CapEx plus amounts we pay to vendors for financing-related CapEx that don't flow through free cash flow. I will tell you that met \u2013 much of the time those vendor-financing payments don't necessarily relate to in-year purchases of CapEx, but relate to prior year. But it's a measure that we've historically provided as just another data point for people to consider. Overall, your takeaway should be from our free cash flow \u2013 from the guides we have out there. One, we intend to continue to fully invest in our businesses. Two, we expect to generate free cash flow at the levels that we've got it to. And we feel really good about the trajectory and being able to accomplish that based on where we are today. Phil Cusick : Thanks, guys. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we could spend some time on the AVOD product that will be launching this summer. Can you elaborate a bit on who you see as the addressable market for that offer? In other words, who do you think you can reach with the AVOD service that you aren't currently reaching with Max? And then how do you intend to reach those consumers? Do you think you'll be as efficient leveraging your existing channels as you have with HBO Max? Or do you think you're going to need to broaden out and work with new partners as you bring that service to market? Thank you. John Stankey : Brett, let me \u2013 I'll give you a little bit of color. And as you know, we're \u2013 for market reasons haven't entirely disclosed everything like pricing, et cetera. And we'll, of course, do that right before the launch, so that we get the maximum benefit of coming into the market. Look, I think that there is a segment of the base and this is particularly true when there are multiple streaming services out there and people are making decisions to reorder their investment and in-home entertainment that are going to be more price-sensitive. And while we believe HBO Max without commercial interruption as a premium product and warrants, what we charge in the market today, we know that that premium in some cases is high enough that there are people when they start to say, well, I've got three services and I aggregate everything up that maybe I won't make a choice to be in it. And that's particularly true if you look at maybe some younger demographics. And as a result of that, we believe getting the price point down where for them to get some well-executed advertising, they would look at the product and service and say within the portfolio the streaming services that they may wish to have in their household or in their apartment that they think that this is a good place to be. Another example will be in certain socioeconomic dynamics. So, you can expect, for example, we believe the AVOD product actually pairs well with some of our prepaid offers and how we might position it, because it tends to line up on a more price-sensitive socioeconomic dynamic. And we think that opens up marketing channel and awareness channel, and ultimately an opportunity to drive penetration in other places where, again, customers are a bit more price-sensitive. So, it really at the end of the day, customer gets to make a choice. And there is no question if you get a lower price point you're going to push it down lower in the demos that it will ultimately subscribe to it. And I think that's more important as people are making portfolio decisions of multiple services in a household. And when you see the reality of an ebb and flow on a direct-to-consumer offering where maybe you hit that period of time, where you're not as enamored with the offering that we have on the new content that's in place. Having that option to be at a lower price point allows somebody to stick with the service and we just think it's a really smart place to be for that segment of the market. In terms of the channels, what we've been \u2013 I think it's really important point that you bring up. And I want to stress this. We've been really, really careful about our channel partners. At the end of the day, a direct-to-consumer business should be a direct-to-consumer business. It should be a business that we have the opportunity to have a direct relationship with the customer, market and sell to them, and work with them in the way that we feel is appropriate. And so, we're -- in some cases, we were criticized for taking a long time to get certain agreements worked out. You should understand that we were doing that under the principle of we refused to back off on the notion, that we wanted to make sure that our distribution and the way we offered the product was something that we ultimately had the ability to talk to our customers, and to bill our customers and make sure that we can manage the lifecycle of our customers over time and do these migrations easily and not allow somebody else between us and the user interface of their customer. And not all launches of streaming products have done that and done it in that same fashion. And so, we've been a little bit more dependent on our owned and operated channels. We've been, I believe, respectful and balanced with our existing distribution partners where we've certainly consented to their rights to be able to bundle and sell the product where we can make sure that we manage the customer experience and the user interface as the customer is inside the product. And that we can appropriately inform them and guide them to the right kind of content, and have the kind of relationship with them that we should have as the direct owner of that product or service. And so, you're going to see us use, for example, our own prepaid channels. But you're not going to see us dramatically change our distribution strategy where just to get volume, we're turning over control and exercise rights on how the product or service is being used. We're in discussions with our existing distributors. We intend to make it available to them under very similar constructs to what we did in economic incentives with the subscription product if they choose to do that. And if they choose to carry it forward and it's done in the way that we think is the right balance for our ability to manage that customer, we'll extend it to them. If not, we'll be moving it largely through our owned and operated channels if that's what's required. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you very much. What is your sense of the fiber investment that could come out of the infrastructure bill in Congress and how much that might be available to you? And can you comment on the FCC's EBBP plan that they're, I think, going into effect later this month and how you might be able to take advantage of that for your customers, both on the wireline and on the wireless side? Thanks. John Stankey : Sure, Frank. The infrastructure bill, euphemistically speaking, the infrastructure bill is a little bit of a large amorphous thing right now. And I think we're in very much the early innings of shaping what it's going to be. I don't pretend that I've got any great insight that I can predict how the political process will play it out, but I'll give you my opinion on it. My opinion is that it will go through some changes. I think, in aggregate, the size of it will probably be different than what it was proposed to be. My sense is that there is enough support on both sides of the aisle that both would like to see broadband spending. If it's a bipartisan approach, I think it would still survive a bipartisan approach. If it ends up not being a bipartisan bill, I think it will still survive not being a bipartisan bill. If you think about how it's executed, I think the White House made a couple of broad statements in the announcement of the policy that were starters. I think you've heard the president say himself that he's open for discussion on things and I know there's a lot of dialogue going on. My sense with that dialogue is that there are members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that maybe have somewhat different views as to how the policy should be executed than what was \u2013 in a very \u2013 at a very high level laid out in the bill with some suggestion. I don't think it was all that specific. And I think we're actively involved in that discussion right now talking about our learnings and our understandings of what we think good policy would be if, in fact, the government chooses to put some subsidy in place around that and some incentives in place. We think it should probably get to a different place than the rough framework that the White House put in place, and we think that there is support on both sides of the aisle and other policy aisles of this administration to try to drive it that way. I believe some of the things were frankly not characterized properly. I think when you get underneath the facts of how broadband infrastructure is deployed in the United States today, what occurs when there's two players in the market that are offering both capable and robust networks, what the price, performance, characteristics of the product are. I think vast parts of the U.S. broadband market are actually performing incredibly well. I think we have an issue that needs to be dealt with on certain degrees of low-income subsidy. Interestingly, voluntarily, several of us in the market including AT&T has a voluntary low-income offer that's out there that it's hard to imagine that a $10 offer, in my view, would be a monopolistic pricing offer. It seems to me that that's a pretty gracious and attractive offer. And if that were the right subsidies put on it that that could be a pretty effective tool of putting more fixed broadband into people's homes. I do believe we have some rural areas that the bill needs to deal with that if the policy is done right on a technology-agnostic way that we can participate in and grow in. And that clearly is going to take some additional discussion and policy formation to get it into that place. We're in the early innings of it. We're active in it. I think it's going to be something at the end of the day like any political process that there will be a middle ground that will come up with some opportunity, but probably not everything we'd like. But we'll be active and aggressive in the places that we can go. The good news is in the guidance that we've given you, in the core of our business, we have a lot of opportunity for growth in broadband. This would be icing on the cake if we were able to make some headway there. I think we can move forward without this policy to deliver to you what we said we were going to deliver. We've been working with the FCC on how the subsidy gets placed out. We've been talking with them about the approach to it. My sense is that they've got their arms around it. They understand how to administer these programs. They are going to do it in a way that I think it will help some of our customers. Again, we've got great offers out in the market for low-income customers. In some cases, there is income stress that maybe don't qualify as low income. The FCC plan will help the income-stressed, but it will particularly help low income. And that coupled with the offers we have in the market, I think, should be generally helpful moving forward. I think we're probably at a peak right now at need. As people return to schools in-person, I think there's going to be a little bit of pressure taken off this dynamic moving forward. But again, we weren't banking on a lot of government subsidy in the guide we've given you on our direction. So if it breaks the right way, it will be a good thing for us. Frank Louthan : Thanks very much John. It\u2019s helpful. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks, Frank. If we can, move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So, John, on the broadband side, just wanted to see if \u2013 given the success you've had on the wireless side with device promotions, and now that seems like it's flowing through to margins as well. Is there any thought about maybe a different go-to-market strategy with broadband as well, which accelerates the pace of growth there in the coming years with respect to penetration because that's been a big focus for you guys for a long time, just wondering if the approach has some room to change. And secondly, on the wireless side, when you think about the margins this quarter, I mean, they were obviously pretty good in the context of some of the promotions you guys have run. And I think you pointed to the promotional costs on a normalized basis per subscriber actually being pretty attractive. Could you just talk about that a little bit more and how that might play out over the course of the year? Thank you. John Stankey : Sure. Kannan, we're \u2013 first of all, if you have any ideas you want to send me, feel free to drop me an email. I'm always looking for good thoughts on what might be effective in the market. But I will tell you, we've had really good success at pairing our wireless services with our broadband customers. And I will tell you it's one of the areas where, frankly, over the last couple of months, we're really pleased with the team's execution and how we've been working that data set and that customer base to put the right attractive offers in place and one of those things were because we have a relationship with the customer. We can maybe do some things a little bit differently in the market and how we position, what those incentives are for them to put two products together than what you might do in a mass-market channel nationally and we feel that that's a pretty attractive place for us to go. And I mentioned we're having really good success bundling our entertainment direct-to-consumer product with broadband, and we're seeing really high marks from customers in doing that. That feels really good. That feels to me like a new version of pay-TV with broadband. It feels like a forward-leaning entertainment product and service coupled with broadband, where we know that when we bundle, we drive churn down. Our success has been really strong on that. We've leaned in on that. We're seeing customers receive it really well. But it is really, really good on customer profitability and asset lives when they make that wireless coupling decision. I'm not going to kind of say too much, but we believe there are some further customer relations on service integration. We can do between wireless and broadband that makes some things even more attractive moving forward for that customer base. Our product road map, as we move into 2022, starts to introduce some of those, and it goes right at the heart of what you're suggesting. And I absolutely believe that will be a winning play. But I don't want to oversell it because right now our broadband footprint, as you know, doesn't cover the entire United States. And we do need to be successful in marketing and selling in the entire United States in our wireless business to be successful. Why are we doing better on promotional unit costs and dynamics? Consistency of execution is one as we've not had to change our approach to the market and change our messaging to customers and go to what I would call the expensive approach to on again, off again, on again, off again. Those things cause you to do things like try to retrain sales people. You have to put incentives and SPIFs in place to get their attention to move through. I will tell you we are operating through our distribution channels in an incredibly consistent fashion, in a way that I look at the numbers and I take great pride to what the team is executed and what they're doing and it looks like sound management. It looks like we're doing the right things and doing them better. And when we get the customer in with the right consistent offer, our trusted sales advisors are doing what you would expect trusted sales advisors to do. They're guiding the customer to the right product and service that meets their needs. And sometimes, that product and service and that solution isn't exactly the thing that the customer was motivated to come and explore. And oftentimes, that's a good outcome for our business when that occurs, and that might be a buy-up on an unlimited plan to higher rates that allow us to drive ARPU up. It might be bundling another product and service with them. And we're getting the goodness that comes along with that consistent message. It causes customers to explore with us instead of maybe their first inclination, which might have been to go and explore with the competitor and move their service. And that's why the churn levels are so much lower. So we're getting really good lift from our promotional spend. We're getting really good performance when you look at how we're managing the device recovery life cycle. It's all good and it's all helping. And when you're not driving the volume that we had driven in the past, when we're down at those low gross-add levels, guess what? Your unit costs are higher per gross add. When you're operating at the levels that we're operating at right now, you get some scale benefits to it. So it just \u2013 it all comes together in a way that's really goodness, and that's what you're seeing work through the numbers. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Kannan. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thanks for filling me in. I guess two questions. One, I was hoping you could just talk about what you're seeing from a competitive perspective. In broadband, you've obviously had success now for a few quarters stepping up your fiber net adds. Just curious if you're seeing any response to that and how that might expect the momentum you're anticipating in the remainder of the year. And then secondly, Pascal, as it relates to the guidance, after such a strong quarter, the revenue growth guidance of plus 1% seems pretty conservative as does the EPS expectation that it's flat. I think in a previous question, your response is that it's less about anticipating any type of downturn, if you will, in terms of the financial results, but more a function of you guys not wanting to be in the habit of having to change your guidance so frequently. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly. Thank you. John Stankey : So, Colby, I don't think I've seen what I would call any dramatic shift or adjustment into the broadband market and the competitive dynamics around it. We're not pleased with our performance in places where we don't have fiber, which is why I need additional footprint and why we're headed that direction. But we're incredibly pleased with our ability to compete where we do have it, and it's been pretty consistent in terms of the competitive dynamics around that. In fact, I think, we're doing some things right now that are improving our performance overall because our focus on the market and how we're thinking about the integrated customer experience and, really, what we're now starting to do took us maybe a little too long to get there. But we're thinking beyond the side of the house is the way I would think about it. We've always built really good networks. And we do a really good job of ensuring that they're consistent, reliable, and work well. But the inside of the house is a bit of a dirty place right now from a data perspective, and it's getting dirtier by the day as customers do more and more, add more devices. And we're now starting to work really hard on how our product and service can help the customer inside the house. That's the result of making our product look more consistent, more reliable, and perform better. And I think we're in the early innings of that, frankly. And so one of the competitive dynamics that we really want to push on is ensuring that, where we used to kind of, I would say, wipe our hands as the problem that occurred on the other side of the network interface in many instances, trying to lean on and embracing that in a way that's helpful to the customer. It makes our product and service work better. And we think that that's a great way to compete moving forward. And it has a real interesting opportunity to start differentiating the product and service offer moving forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about that, coupled with our fiber infrastructure as we move into 2022. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : And, Colby, on your guidance point, your commentary was spot on. It is early in the year. We're really happy with our performance. We don't want to get into the habit of changing our guidance each and every quarter. And John said this earlier, but just to underscore the point that he said, what we want to try to do is to focus on running the business and investing appropriately. And we believe that has to be our priority. And we're comfortable we can do that and, at the same time, deliver on our financial commitments. But we won't be in the habit of changing guidance every quarter. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much for the questions. John, turn it over to you for any wrap comments. John Stankey : Well, first, thank you all for being with us today. And, Pascal, it's good to have you here. And -- but sadly, you no longer consider you have a first coming up, so we look forward to many more of these with you. But what I would tell you is second quarter of last year, we told you about where we wanted to focus this business and that we wanted to make sure that we were gaining momentum and success in satisfying broadband customers on our wireless business and what we could do in growing fiber and fixed connections and how we grew a forward-leaning entertainment-based product. And I think this quarter you're seeing that the team has done a remarkable job of getting their focus together over the course of the last year and carrying success forward. And I would submit to you, you can plow through the numbers and see that it's being done in the right way across the board where these are growing products that they're growing in the right way with the opportunity for high-value subscribers that are highly satisfied, sticky with long and service lines, and I feel really good about that in terms of building the franchise. And then, finally, if you look underneath those numbers, we have a lot of confidence in what we've seen coming out of the first part of this year. We told you our guide was a conservative guide. We don't know exactly where things are going with the clawback from COVID. I'm hopeful and optimistic that we see citizens continue to get vaccinated, and we continue this march out. And if those tailwinds continue, I think we're going to have a really strong year in front of us. But there is still a degree of uncertainty that we're all trying to adjust to. I'm sure you understand that. But irrespective of that, the fundamentals underneath the business are really strong right now. You see that in the quarter. We're going to continue to ride that, and I look forward to talking to you 90 days from now. Thanks for your attention. We'll see you soon.

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pas Desroches, our CFO. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of our call are Jeff McElfresh, the CEO of our Communications Group; and Jason Kilar, CEO for WarnerMedia. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations Web site. And as always, our earnings materials are on our Web site. I also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum auction 110. So, unfortunately we can't answer your questions about that today. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. At the risk of being repetitive or I guess consistent, depending on your take, the framework for what I want to cover today should be familiar to you. It's been four quarters since we articulated a simplified strategy in how we planned on evaluating our success going forward based on three priorities. First, we wanted to grow subscriber relationships through our three market focus areas of 5G, Fiber, and HBO Max. Second, we initiated an effort to transform our business to be effective and efficient in everything we do so that we could allocate increased resources to support these focus areas. And third, we committed to deliberate capital allocation to support increased investment growth, improve returns, narrow our operating focus, and restore flexibility to our balance sheet. To achieve these priorities, we made some difficult near-term decisions to set our businesses up for success in the coming years. And that success is defined by improving our competitive position through the investment in best-in-class products and experiences for our customers. By doing so, we believe the execution of this strategy will drive better returns and profitable long-term growth. Let's look at what we've achieved in the past year on slide four. We've made notable progress on each of our priorities. In wireless, we're gaining share, lowering churn, and had our best 12 months of postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade. And we just posted record quarterly wireless EBITDA. In fiber, customers have similarly responded to the combination of a premium service at attractive prices, and we've grown our base by more than one million subscribers. By year-end, we'll have expanded our fiber footprint by three million consumer and business customer locations. And just over a year after launch, we've grown our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers by 10.7 million. We transformed HBO from a $6 billion business that was not growing to an $8 billion run rate business that grew at nearly 40% this quarter. We've also made solid initial progress in our cost transformation efforts, which have produced $2 billion in savings that we've reinvested into our core growth areas. We're streamlining our operations and effectively growing digital fulfillment channels. Our NPS scores have improved significantly, and our fiber customers continue to rate us number one in customer satisfaction. Churn levels have dropped substantially too. Our second quarter postpaid phone churn matched a record low. And in broadband, we had our lowest churn on record and the highest second quarter fiber gross adds ever. At WarnerMedia, we continue to deliver great content. In the first-half of the year, we introduced hit series such as Mare of Easttown and Hacks. And our lineup in the back-half of the year is even stronger with new seasons of popular series such as Succession, Raised by Wolves, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Love Life. That's on top of the day-and-date movies we'll have on the platform such as Space Jam : A New Legacy, and Suicide Squad, Dune, and Matrix 4. When the Emmys were announced last week, HBO Max and HBO led the field with 130 nominations, the most of any network or platform. In total, WarnerMedia received more than 180 nominations. I'm really proud of the way the team is executing. And speaking of good execution, we're seeing indications that our DIRECTV deal with TPG might close in the next few weeks, ahead of what we expected. Also, we're pleased with the new management team's ability to exceed operational expectations since we announced the transaction. Our intention with WarnerMedia is the same. We want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands the respective opportunities for success going forward. And we continue to invest at strong levels, more than $60 billion in the last 12 months in 5G wireless, including spectrum, fiber, and premium content. Finally, we announced or closed a number of non-core asset dispositions, supporting our path to balance sheet flexibility. The same time, we positioned each of our three major businesses, AT&T Communications, WarnerMedia, and DIRECTV, the right capital structure, the right assets, the right management team, and in the case of the latter two, the right partners to optimize the returns to drive material value creation going forward. These decisions were not easy. And in some cases, they compelled us to rethink how to best deliver returns to our shareholders, leading us to balance long-term value creation with an attractive dividend. As our second quarter results demonstrate, the momentum in our strategic areas of focus is real, supporting our view that we have the right business strategy and capital structure in place for longer-term success. Today, we're updating our 2021 outlook for our consolidated business, but our work is far from over. We know that consistent execution is the only way to win and keep our investors' confidence in the strategy we put forward. And I couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making. I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across Mobility, Fiber, and HBO Max. We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phone, that's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues to be strong, and we continue to take share. The gross adds are up, churn is at record low levels, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago thanks to the consistency in our offerings. The story with Fiber remains much the same. We continue to see solid subscriber growth, with most of those customers new to AT&T. And broadband revenues grew more than 8%. HBO Max continues to exceed our expectation. Having surpassed the lower end of our global subscriber target six months ahead of plan, we are now raising our expectations to 70 million to 73 million global subscribers by the end of the year. We also launched our domestic ad-supported version of HBO Max, as well as our international offering in 39 Latin-American territories at the end of the quarter. That sets us up for additional customer growth as our addressable market expands. Let's now turn to slide seven, for our consolidated financial results. Last year, we saw the brunt of the pandemic's impact on our Q2 results. While the pandemic is still having some impact on our results, we're seeing our businesses emerge stronger than before, with growth accelerating in our market-focused areas. Revenues were up more than $3 billion or 7.6% from a year ago, gains in WarnerMedia, Mobility, and Consumer Wireline more than offset declines in video and legacy business services. Adjusted EBITDA declined mostly due to pandemic-impacted timing with sports costs in last year's second quarter. We'll talk more about that in a moment, but we expect most of that to reverse itself next quarter. In fact, we expect consolidated EBITDA to be flat to up modestly next quarter, and improving thereafter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was %0.89, that's up more than 7% year-over-year. This includes about $200 million of pretax gains principally from mark-to-market gains on benefit plan investments. Adjustments for the quarter included a $4.6 billion pretax non-cash write-down of the Vrio assets based on our sales transaction announced yesterday. Cash flows continue to be resilient. Cash from operations came in at $10.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $7 billion even with a $2.4 billion increase in WarnerMedia cash content investment. Our dividend payout ratio was about 55%. Cash flows this quarter were also impacted by the capitalization of interest of about $250 million associated with our recent fee band C-band spectrum purchases which are recorded as investing activities. This accounting treatment stops once the spectrum is deployed. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business, on slide eight. Our Communications segment grew revenues driven by gains in Mobility and Consumer Wireline. Mobility growth continues to accelerate, and we delivered another terrific quarter. Our simple postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. Revenues were up more than 10%, with service revenues growing 5%. Postpaid phone churn matched a record low, and we continue to have strong customer growth, especially in our postpaid phone base. Our postpaid phone customer net adds improved by nearly a million year-over-year. And EBITDA is up $200 million, our highest EBITDA quarter on record. This growth came without a material return in international roaming revenues, and a difficult capacitor last year's Q2 that included more than $100 million of gains on tower sales. As you think about the balance of the year, keep in mind, we are expecting a normal handset introduction cycle the third quarter versus last year's fourth quarter launch. Also on the timing front, we expect our recent agreement with dish to provide a boost to wireless service revenues in 2022. Business wireline continues to deliver consistent margins and solid EBITDA even as customers transition away from higher margin legacy services and products. We saw a sequential improvement in both EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Year-over-year comparisons were impacted by benefits related to the pandemic in the year ago quarter. We expect similar challenging comps in the third quarter. However, with continued product rationalization and cost management, we're very comfortable with maintaining business wireline margins in the high 30% for the remainder of the year. Our fiber growth continues to be solid. We added 246,000 fiber customers in the quarter. Broadband ARPU grew by 6.1% year-over-year. Our aggregate Fiber penetration rate is now more than 36% up from about 31% a year ago. And nearly 80% of net ads are new AT&T broadband customers. We've reached a major inflection point in our consumer wireline business. Broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. This help drive consumer wireline revenues up 2.9%. We expect broadband revenues to continue to outpace legacy decline. EBITDA trends are also expected to continue improving as we make our way through the second-half of the year. Let's move to WarnerMedia's results which on slide nine. We feel really good about our execution that WarnerMedia coming out of the pandemic. Subscription, advertising and content revenues have accelerated. Customers love HBO Max, and subscriber growth is exceeding expectations. And we had a successful launch of both our ad supported and international HBO Max offerings late in the quarter. Revenues were up more than 30% thanks to higher subscription, advertising and content revenues. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenues grew nearly 40% reflecting the success of HBO Max. Advertising revenues were up nearly 50% driven by sports, and upfront negotiations so far have been really strong. Content and other revenues were up 35%, reflecting the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. The return of sports had a big impact on an advertising revenues and EBITDA in the quarter. In fact, sports contributed more than $400 million of advertising revenues, and we incurred sports costs of $1.1 billion in the quarter. So discrete losses from sports increased more than $600 million year-over-year due to last year's suspension of sports in the second quarter, we expect most of that to reverse itself in the third quarter as the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA season. We now have 47 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers. And more than 67 million worldwide subscribers and domestic ARPU is just a little less than $12. Our ad supported international offerings were launched too late in the quarter to have much of an impact on the second quarter results, but we're enthusiastic about their prospects given the initial receptivity. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our subscriber growth expectations for the year. We're seeing good momentum, especially in our Latin American markets. We expect most of our subscriber growth for the remainder of the year to be from lower ARPU subscribers in that region. To lean into HBO Max fast start in Latin America, we may push back our launch in some European markets until early 2022. This shift is factored into our revised HBO Max subscriber guides for the year. Now, let's shift the guidance. As John mentioned, we updated our consolidated guidance for the year. Let's discuss that on slide 10. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 is on a business as usual basis and includes a full-year contribution from DirecTV. Based on the momentum we're seeing across our operations, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range up from the initial 1% guidance. We also expect wireless service revenue growth of 3% for the year, up from about 2%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to increase in the low to mid single digit range, that's up from our earlier guidance of stable with 2020. Growth capital investment expectations remain in the $22 billion range, and we now expect about $27 billion in free cash flows for the year. Also, we now have better clarity on the projected close of the DirecTV transaction, we expect the transaction to close in early August. Here's the expected impact from excluding five months of DirecTV on the consolidated financial guidance we just laid out. Revenues are expected to be lower by $9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be lowered by a billion. Free cash flow is also expected to be lower by about a billion, equating to $26 billion for the full-year. We expect no change to our updated adjusted EPS guidance as benefits from the accounting treatment related to the NFL Sunday ticket are largely expected to be offset by certain fixed costs that were previously allocated to DirecTV. Capital investment guidance is also expected to remain the same. Obviously, the actual financial impact could vary depending upon DirecTV's performance, the actual close date and other considerations we recognize the financial structure of the DirecTV transaction is complex. That is why we included some incremental details on cash and dividend distribution terms in our press release. Shortly after we close the deal, we plan on providing pro forma historical financials to help your modeling going forward. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : Of course. And our first question today comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Okay, great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Anything you could tell us about the details of the wholesale deal with Dish, specifically just any thoughts, I know Pascal, you mentioned that it would affect revenues in '22, but just do you guys expect to take all of the traffic on to your network and maybe if you could give us a sense on when it should start to migrate or over what timeframe do you see that? And then also, as part of that announcement, there is some details about some spectrum that you guys could utilize from Dish, is that the 700 megahertz spectrum that you'd have access to, and maybe if you could give us some details on how quickly that could be put into -- it could be lit up and sort of used by AT&T Mobility, would be great. Thanks. John Stankey : Sure, John. So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say, having watched some of the comments of the last couple of days, let me frame one thing, we have been in the wholesale business, since as long as I've been working for this company, and the wholesale business has been very good to our company. And it's a very important element of how we manage our returns and how we kind of think about tracking the right kind of scale on our business moving forward, and that -- it's both true in the fixed and wireless business. And we've been cognizant of percentages of traffic that we have in various aspects of our business and always try to maintain a balance. And I would say my experience with this company and looking at the relationships we've had from a wholesale perspective, we've always managed to strike relationships that we think are win-win relationships for the parties involved. Second thing, I would say is I believe that Dish is going to be a company that in their business model, what they choose to do moving forward is going to be successful one way or the other. And my point of view, and when we start thinking about wholesale businesses, when somebody is going to be successful, it's always nice for us to be successful along with them. We think there's accretive way to do that that drives a reasonable return back into the business, and again, manages the balance of that traffic in the aggregate of the business. And I think we've achieved that in this case. And frankly, given the nature of their business and where they are in its maturity, and what our interests are, and ultimately aggregating as much traffic on our networks as possible I'm looking forward to demonstrating to Dish that we can be a good partner, and that we can carry the right kind of traffic, and we can do things to help them grow their infrastructure over time on parts of our network, where they may not have ready access to infrastructure that we can ultimately support them with. And I think that's a good thing for AT&T over the long haul, given the nature of our business and what we've done, and the balance that we like to keep between retail and wholesale traffic. The construct around this particular agreement, as you should think about it is, as you know, it was set up so that as Dish continues to build their own infrastructure for own and operate, they need places to put traffic. And so, while this is a 10-year agreement, it's discussed, I think in the disclosures is a minimum commitment per year, one should think about this as probably being something that's more front-end loaded than back-end loaded, in terms of how that commitment retires, and I think you should also think about it in terms of Dish has established with us a minimum annual commitment. That's not necessarily the annual commitment, or the maximum annual commitment, and a lot of this will be based on our effective performance with them, and ultimately what they choose to do in the market, but frankly, we'd aspire to possibly see that, you know, be something greater than what those minimum levels are, that have been put in place. But this was a comfortable construct that I think both parties could agree to get started and establish all the practices and processes that are necessary to have an effective wholesale arrangement like this. And I think that we need to demonstrate that we can do well, and ultimately see that grow. And I don't want to speak on behalf of Dish or Charlie. I'm sure he will, when he has a chance to comment on that. But I believe, one of the reasons they view this as being a good move for them is their assessment of where things were in the industry is, they felt like we could be a very capable and more capable partner than their current arrangement. And they have motivations or business reason to continue to deepen that relationship with us. I would go on to say, as we think about what we do with them on this relationship going forward, there are a lot of options that we can explore. Spectrum, as you know, is certainly one that's open. We have a variety of Spectrum licenses where our existing radio infrastructure can ultimately deploy and put to use some of their spectrum. That's been done through the pandemic. We have options to do some of that, as well as we move forward and look, I don't think any of us know over the course of a longer-term relationship, what's going to happen to other regs and specs on Spectrum. And I think parties will keep their mind open as those evolutions occur and look for some other options to pursue. But right now, we know what we need to do with the wholesale agreement that, frankly, is really no different than any other wholesale agreement that it's in the market, like what maybe Verizon does with Cable, or what we've done with other entities that have elected to use us on a wholesale basis. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that, your team did a great job pulling it together, is there anything you would add? Jeff McElfresh : John, I think you covered the broad strokes of it, I would just say the cadence between the two organizations and getting ready to begin migrating this traffic towards the latter part of this year, and ongoing into 2022 has been very positive, I think the comments from the operation have been that the AT&T network has got the capacity and the coverage with all of the investments that we've made over the last several years, we can actually afford to do something like this and not worry so much about our spectrum position. And our technology migration that we've got experience in and upgrading from 4G to 5G and making those transitions seamless is something I think the Dish organization is looking forward to working with us on. John Stankey : I don't think anybody around here is upset about taking $500 million a year out of the competitors pocket either so. John Hodulik : Got you, okay. It sounds good, guys. Thanks. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much. Operator, we can move to next question. Operator : We do have a question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Yes, thank you very much. Good morning. Just got a quick update on the Warner Media Discovery deal, any updates on timing, regulatory process, tax status, structure, et cetera and then for Jeff, you did an interesting deal around the 5G core with Microsoft Azure. It'd be great just to learn more about the details of that any numbers you can give us and the opportunities that that gives you? Thanks. John Stankey : Is that a legal line change, Simon, or is that, Simon 2.0? Simon Flannery : We'll figure it out on the transcript, yes. John Stankey : I think net of where we are on the Discovery process is no news is good news. We're basically tracking to the process, as we would expect to do. And I think you're probably familiar enough with these things that right now, it's a lot of work with the regulatory agencies and document production and providing information that's responsive to their requests so that they can begin the reviews. And all that is underway. There's nothing we see that that's been particularly problematic, nor is it far enough along where I think you can effectively say that anybody has developed any position or point of view on something. So, we continue to move through it, I'll tell you internally, all the normal steps are going on to be prepared operationally for when we would expect an approval. I think as I indicated, when we announced the transaction, Simon, we expected it was going to be next year, and probably close to a four year overview to get this done. And I don't have any reason to suggest it's going to be anything other than that, at this point. We've had some interesting and pleasant surprises in some cases, I think we moved through to DirecTV process a little bit faster than what we had expected. It's not a complicated transaction, I think certainly supports it. And if we were to be fortunate enough to do that, because of the straightforward nature of the transaction, we'll take it and we'll be prepared for that, if that were to happen. But at this point, I'm expecting it's going to be a fulsome review. And we'll run through the process as we normally do and get to the end of it and probably have as we approach the latter part of it a little bit more insight for you as to what's going on, it's just a little early, Jeff? Jeff McElfresh : Simon, on the Microsoft transaction, I think it's appropriate to point out that AT&T and Microsoft, we've got a very deep and wide ranging strategic relationship between the two firms and this particular deal that you referenced is just another example of how we choose to partner with companies like Microsoft who have expertise in doing things, they do this day in and day out for a living, and that is scaled compute. And as you know, over the last several years, our labs organizations and our network team has been hard at work virtualizing our core network functions. What this deal essentially does is it brings Microsoft to the edge of our network and supporting our network workloads, at a scale level for efficiency and as a partner in this, our engineers and their engineers are developing this solution on a broad scale across the business, across the network. We're going to enjoy some anchor tenant benefits from that, we're not disclosing any specific financial details. But one thing that we're not doing and I've kind of read this in the trade, in the press a bit is we're not outsourcing our core network function. We're relying upon Microsoft to develop a scaled compute and storage capabilities at the edge while we retain control of our network stack and the kinds of services and products that we're going to offer to the market. And as John has shared over the last four quarters, our focus here is to put our energy on the things that differentiate our service. And by doing this, it enables us to reallocate resources that were once attempting to build scaled network cloud compute capabilities. We rely on Microsoft for that and the Azure for operator's capability going forward. And then our product development teams and our engineers really work on the service layer, and the kinds of products and services that we intend to provide with our fiber and our 5G network to consumers and to our enterprise customers. Simon Flannery : Any color on timing? Jeff McElfresh : No, we've not disclosed product launches or capabilities. This deal just got announced and it's in the process right now of the integration of the two teams, we will go on for a more appropriate time. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Jeff McElfresh : Thank you. John Stankey : Thanks very much. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much. Maybe two if I could. The first question is, Pascal, thanks for the information about what the perspective impact of the DTV dispositions might be, I guess a helpful mirror image of that would be what kind of EBITDA and free cash flow from DTV is baked into your current outlook as you've laid it out here today. And the second question is, obviously two new factors impacting the earnings outlook, one is changing Rio from operational to [indiscernible] for sale and the benefit from depreciation there, and then the new kind of approach towards capitalized interest and having taken down the interest expense. Can you talk about what those two factors are doing to inform the new earnings growth outlook? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Sure thing, Dave, on DTV, we have not provided detailed guidance yet. But as we said, once we -- once the transaction closes, we will provide details to help with the modeling. In terms of Rio, you said that you asked about the impact of stopping depreciation amortization. Think about it as $0.01 to $0.02 for the balance of the year. So, not significant and capitalized interest we just, as you saw in my remarks, I said that it's about $250 billion in Q2. So think about that as being the zone you should model going forward. David Barden : Thanks. And so, if I do that math, it kind of suggests that the -- for the balance of the organization, it still kind of more stable as [indiscernible] top line. Is that fair? Pascal Desroches : I think that's fair. But remember, we are stepping up our investment significantly across the board in mobility, fiber, and HBO Max. So that -- some of this is self-imposed by the investments we're making. And you're seeing the delivery of the return to the top-line in over time. Over time, we expect to continue transformation effort and continued revenue growth, we're going to drive operating leverage, which should translate into EBITDA improvements. And I said this in my comments, we expect next quarter EBITDA to be flat up modestly. And so this is really a good outcome. The businesses are we're investing pulling our businesses, and we're delivering returns as evidenced by the revenue growth. And we're optimistic that all of that is going to translate into profit growth and cash going forward. David Barden : Great, thanks. John Stankey : Thanks very much, Dave. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. First, John. There are a lot of questions about the retention promo we launched last year, and it keeps running. But maybe talk about what else has changed in the wireless go-to-market strategy, aside from the retention promos in last year? And then what do you see driving the industry strength this quarter as well? And then quick follow-up, do those boost customers will most of them need new phones to come to your network? Or can you just convert them without a new phone? Thank you. John Stankey : So, Phil, since I have Jeff right here, I'm going to go ahead and just have him address it since he -- was his day in and day out. Jeff McElfresh : Yes, hey Phil, appreciate the question on the wireless business. We've been operating in this go-to-market model for the past four quarters. And I've got to tell you, it just continues to prove to be sustainable, I -- when I think about it, and I'd encourage you to think about as three simple elements. And the first is, we have simplified our offers in the market. And we have remained consistent in our offer constructs over the last four quarters, despite really a highly active and a competitive environment. But the second element that I think is sometimes overlooked is our persistent focus on the customer experience. And that is execution across our sales and distribution channels. Our newly formed a year ago, customer advocacy teams work in the grind on improving the experience of our products and our services. And then our network organization that just continues to put the capital into the ground and drive for third year in a row of the nation's best network. And those two things combined have responded and continued positive responses from the market and in customers. Both our existing subscriber base, as I think all are aware of, but also those of other competitors are choosing to join AT&T network. And we've been able to achieve and sustain taking share in multiple segments. It's across the board. It's not in any one particular segment. We're growing in consumer, we're growing in small business, we're growing with our first net position, we're growing in enterprise. And as Pascal mentioned earlier, we've set a 10-year record for net ad growth here in the second quarter, but we've also set a record for our turn and the NPS results that customers are giving us for our wireless products and services. And so in short, the customers themselves are telling us that we're doing something right. When you grow the top line revenue growth through the subscriber growth, remembering that we are third place in market share. We've got just a little over 27.5% of the market. Our growth trajectory right now is roughly 35% to 36% shared net adds. We're doing it also efficiently and through our transformation program and our distribution optimization, we're able to mine dollars out of the operations to support this growth and drive EBITDA growth at record levels here in the second quarter, year-over-year as well as sequentially. And so this operating leverage that we've achieved gives us confidence that this model is sustainable, but we got a lot of work to do. As I mentioned, we still have a third place share position in the market. We haven't made our way fully through upgrading our existing customer base on unlimited plans. We still are early in the cycle of upgrading our base on the 5G devices. And so teams are doing a great job. We are satisfied. I feel very strong about our position in the market, but we're staying focused on what customers want. And as long as we're getting the positive response, we're going to stick with it. John Stankey : And in terms of the overall strength in the market, Phil, I probably, I don't think there is any one particular thing I'd look at, but there is a number of factors. One obviously, many people are flushed with probably incremental cash and what they might've otherwise have had for a variety of different reasons. And they look for things to spend the money on. And I would say that generally speaking, these are high value, high utility services that we sell, and I can understand why on the margin, people may make a decision around that. I think secondly, the postpaid strength, clearly there has been some suppression on the prepaid market as I think value and things occur and there has been some movement in that direction. Third, you got to adjust some of these numbers in the industry. When you think about how many customer lines are actually what I would call an economic decision of paid for versus not paid for. And that probably is having a little bit of an impact on the aggregate numbers. Jeff, I don't know if you think there's anything else that you would point to? Jeff McElfresh : No, I wouldn't. I think you've covered it. John Stankey : Okay. Phil Cusick : And then on the boost conversion, thanks. John Stankey : Yes, there is -- obviously there -- I think boosts in, we've got a situation where additional work through whatever their arrangement is commercially with, T-Mobile on those. And then I think there has been some public discussion around what that entails and what's happening and we're not in the middle of that debate and what's occurring. And I think it still has a little bit of path to play, but yes, there is a segment of those customers that ultimately if they were to come over to our network will require a device change out exactly what the pace of that is and when that's necessary and how it occurs. And the total numbers of that I think is yet to be played out. Jeff, is there anything you would add on that? Jeff McElfresh : Yes, not a 100% required device conversion risk, some require SIM spots, and they're a little easier to transition, but you've covered it appropriate. Phil Cusick : Thanks, guys. John Stankey : Thanks very much, Phil. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good morning. Two questions if I could. First, when you take the plan investments in 5G and fiber all together, can you share the percent of homes over the next three to five years in the U.S., where AT&T can deliver better than DSL performing in the home? And secondly, just going back to the DISH transaction that you were describing earlier, because I think about some of the history, John that you were sharing when AT&T entered into some of those larger wholesale deals years ago, it felt like it was more resellers and [indiscernible] that were complimentary to the AT&T focus, a lot of it on prepaid before AT&T was a larger provider in a prepaid category. So when you evaluated the deal this time with DISH, how did you consider whether or not DISH would be a competitor that maybe more complimentary to the addressable market that you're going after relative to a competitor that may be going directly after the same broad set of customers and revenue that AT&T currently proceeds? John Stankey : Hi, Michael. So why don't I have Jeff go ahead and answer your question on how we think about footprint for coverage of broadband, and then I'll come back and touch on your point of view on the wholesale piece. Jeff McElfresh : Yes, Mike. We've disclosed, we've got investment plans over the long-term to reach 30 million homes passed with fiber, which is clearly an excess of speeds, capable by copper cable or DSL. I would point to today our 5G network delivers speeds over 250 million POPs covered that exceed that of DSL. We have not made the choice or decision to launch wide scale fixed wireless internet, but rest assured that the strength of our wireless network is providing options for us as we migrate some of our legacy wire line, DSL customers, off of that technology over to a better technology, served up with fiber or wireless, and where it doesn't make sense for us to invest in fiber for the long-term in certain demographic areas or market areas. We choose to serve that with wireless and we'll leverage the 5G existing network that we've got with our sub-six spectrum strength. Outside of that, we're not disclosing the number of homes covered by the wireless network. We generally measure that in terms of POPs. John Stankey : So, Michael, in your comment I think I probably disagreed with the front end of your premise. I think we do things that are complimentary in terms of we think there are creative opportunities to bring profitable traffic on the network, but our portfolio owned and operated services, frankly covers the breadth of whatever a customer needs. I mean, there isn't really a customer base that we couldn't go out and sell an owned and operated service to. And we've been in that position for some period of time. We have a very strong prepaid business, which plays in the value segment. We have a variety of different pre-pay offers that are out there. We have great post-paid offers that cover a full gamut of things. So, yes, there are other operators out there that on a resale or MDNO basis go and attack other market segments. But I'd like to compete for those customers on an owned and operated basis as well. And that's always been the case. Now, I think where we're at in the U.S. market, maybe a little bit different than others is, there is kind of a direction toward more owned and operated competition than resale an MDNO operation. And as a result of that occurring, the number of wholesale options I would say moving forward in the future are going to become a little bit more concentrated. And so you're probably to see, where you choose to put that wholesale traffic on your network to be fewer options to go out pursue different partners. And as a result of that, if you want to continue to have an element of wholesale consistency in your market, and to Jeff's point, if you have some excess capacity that you can put to use and use it for either fixed cost coverage, or we're driving up incremental traffic in a place where you have some valid capacity, you're going to obviously choose to do that. I think that's the case here. And as I would also tell you, when you think about this relationship, a broader wholesale capability beyond just the wireless business is a part of this, which is really attractive to us as an infrastructure provider and something we do in our core. And there are opportunities for us to think about, again as we deploy as DISH deploys network infrastructure, where they go for us to do some things that I think are complimentary and helpful to both businesses. Jeff McElfresh : Yes. I would just only add John to your earlier comment during the call that we expect DISH to be successful in the market. And so the competitive dynamics are unchanged here and rather we get to participate in their success at this point. So that's how we analyzed it strategically. John Stankey : Thanks very much, Mike. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Doug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. One for Jeff and one for Jason actually; Jeff, we've focused so much on promotions and subscribers and revenues and in wireless, and you've mentioned on a few occasions the ability to mind for cost efficiencies to support acquisition. What specifically are you addressing in the cost structure? How much is less there? It would be interesting to hear, Jason, I know you were super excited about the Latin-America launch for HBO Max were the learnings from the launch in Latam so far. What percentage of existing HBO subs has moved over to HBO Max, and as we kept track the app downloads, I think it's upwards of 6.5 million in since launch. And we're trying to figure out how much of that is new subscribers versus HBO Max existing customers pivoting over. Thanks so much. Pascal Desroches : Doug, in terms of our transformation agenda, I'd say we're roughly about a third of the way through. We've got two-thirds of the way to go. So we're in the early innings of it. Key themes around our transformation and cost takeout or things like optimizing our distribution elements be at stores and retail locations, and indirect agents as well as our digital and our online buy flows. Second area is transformation as we're now at a point in time where we're managing a higher percentage of our volume through digital than we ever have, and because we've perfected some of the ailments and our product experiences of the past. We're able to enjoy a lot more self-install and customer self-serve capabilities. And that's required us to work through not only the by flow experiences online, but also some of the platforms and technologies that are behind the scenes supporting our frontline resources. Third, our call center operations and our IT organization are hurt at work, just kidding, planning, simply more efficient per transaction. And as I said, I think we've got probably a two-thirds of the way left to go, it will take time, these initiatives are funded, they're inside of our outlook, and inside of our guidance and other teams just hard at work, and the grind day in and day out to drive it. John Stankey : Jason. Jason Kilar : Well, thanks for the questions. In terms of learnings from Latam so far at an overall level, we're feeling very good about the launch. A Beta was only two days before the end of the quarter. And so obviously, we're not sharing details, but this call. But in terms of the biggest lessons, number one is the content and the stories that we have on the service. The team did a remarkable job in terms of planning for this launch, and making sure that we put our best foot forward in terms of not only original new productions, but also an incredible library. And then the other three things I'd mentioned is distribution obviously is key. And we certainly lined up had healthy distribution partnerships ahead throughout Latin America. The tech and product works. And it's a modern experience that we're very proud of. And finally, you got to have the value. It's the value proposition is a very strong one in Latin America. And so in your last question, Doug, in terms of incrementality, and HBO migrations, we're seeing material incremental subscriber additions and so. Again, not for this call in at this moment, but certainly for the next quarter. Doug Mitchelson : Thank you both. John Stankey : Thanks very much. Operator, can we move to the next question. Operator : Of course. And our next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks. If you don't mind, first on fiber, you've had pretty consistent net adds, but you're still under penetrated, you're going to be meaningfully expanding the footprint, you've got a better service, you can match anybody's bundle. Can you help us think through whether there is an opportunity or the timeline for an opportunity to maybe step up that cadence of fiber net adds, because it certainly seems like that's an opportunity for the company. And then just as a follow up on the WarnerMedia side, you're six months into going day in day with the theatrical slate on HBO Max and in the theatres. I know, that was a strategy that was unique for this year, but I was hoping you could give us some insight into what you've learned from that, and how that might shape your view on what a more permanent strategy should be in terms of thinking about the theatrical release plate going forward? Thank you. John Stankey : Jeff, go ahead, why don't you to tackle the first one? Jeff McElfresh : Yes, Brett, so the first two quarters of this year have essentially been built selling into our aged fiber footprint from the prior bill. We are currently deploying some of the early stages of our next 3 million bill that we've disclosed for this year. As we cited earlier, Analysts Day, the bulk of that inventory is going to come online towards the back half of the year. And so my expectations are that our net add performance takes a step up as that inventory comes online. Having said that, thing that's really strong for us and exciting is one product continues to be durable as you point out the best technology. It's a great price value proposition. It's got the highest NPS scores in the industry. Two, 80% of our net performance here in the first-half of the year is actually new relationships AT&T. And that's given us an opportunity to move into those households with the best-in-class fixed broadband service as well as offer up some of the other products and services like wireless. And so, each of these execution elements we believe are going to continue to perform and continue to improve. This is not a quarterly game. This is a long-term plan. And we're just building momentum quarter-to-quarter. John Stankey : Jason, do you want to touch on the day-and-date issue? Jason Kilar : Sure, Brad thanks for the question. In terms of what we've learned, there's probably two things I'd highlight. One is that the motion picture format absolutely matters. And it matters in a number of ways. But I'll highlight to, it matters in theaters. By data versus comm, which we released this quarter, it's done over $463 million in revenue at the theaters. And so, so clearly motion pictures matter and will continue to matter when it comes to theatrical exhibition. They also matter at home, and absolutely, in terms of the response that we've gotten not just from that title, but from all of our day-and-date titles. We feel very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home. In terms of the things in terms of where things go in the future. I think it's fair to say that, and I've said this before publicly, I certainly don't anticipate as going back to the way the world was in 2015, or '16, or '17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an all the card transaction or something else. So we'll have shorter windows for a portion of our slate 45-days specifically, but the Warner Bros. is also going to be producing over 10 motion pictures that will be available on HBO Max on day one. And so I think that what you're going to see is this industry continues to evolve, and to continue to innovate in ways that not only works for consumers and fans, but also works for our business partners. Brett Feldman : Thank you. John Stankey : Thanks very much for the questions, Brett. Operator, we can move to the next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. [Technical difficulty]\u2026 Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. Maybe just follow-up a little bit more on the consumer wireline, what point do we think that can really start to see the consistent top-line growth with based on all the fiber and broadband you've pushed out? And secondly, on FirstNet, where are we on penetration there? And can you comment on the FirstNet based and what percentage of that or have been net new customers AT&T? Thanks. Jeff McElfresh : Hey, Frank. We have achieved revenue growth in our consumer wireline business. And as Pascal pointed out, we expect that to continue to accelerate already looking at the 8% to 9%, only in the broadband business. And so we've got confidence. We've made that pivot now. In terms of FirstNet, we're over 17,000 agencies were ahead of all of our commitments with FirstNet authority, and all the IOC build out commitments and payments. As a result of that, and the subscriber base has peaked over 2.5 million, I'm not going to comment on what percent of that base is incremental or new to AT&T, I would just leave you with -- we are growing market share in a highly competitive wireless business and FirstNet has been a critical element for us to take share, and unseat possibly other carriers who have long held a strong position in public safety and in this part of the community. And so, that program continues to perform very strong and we don't see any signs of that slowing down. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Frank, one other thing that I would add on consumer wireline, as I said in the first quarter, we expect profitability trends to improve we saw they improved from Q1 to Q2, and we expect that to continue as we make our way through the back part of the year. And we will similar to what we've done with revenues, we will make the pivot on profits as we get through the back-half of the year. John Stankey : Thanks very much for the question. Frank Louthan : Thank you very much. John Stankey : Operator, if we can move to the next caller. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. I think one of the debates for investors coming off the WarnerMedia announcement was how you actually get to that $20 billion in free cash flow in 2023 that you've guided to. And when you just run the EBITDA on the businesses that remain, you don't quite get there. And I think that the two things that you guys have outlined is number one, the cost synergies you've talked about, I think $1.75 billion to $2 billion by that time now you've also mentioned the billion dollars plus in distributions from DirecTV. I guess two questions there, number one is that as it relates to Jeff's response in response to Doug's question being one-third through the cost transformation, is that effectively one-third through getting the $1.75 billion to $2 billion and any color there. And then secondly, I guess as it relates to the components, is there anything else worth flagging, besides those two things that cost synergies and distribution that helps to kind of bridge that gap to that plus $20 billion? Thank you. Jason Kilar : A couple of points to keep in mind, one, when you look at interest, once the WarnerMedia transaction closes, our net debt will go down significantly and the interest savings for that are fairly meaningful, you can do the math, just think roughly $40 billion, $45 billion of cash coming in. And that's after our DirecTV cash that we expect to come in beginning of August. So, overall, we expect a meaningful savings in interest, one, two currently we've said this on a number of occasions. Currently, we are the contributions from WarnerMedia are not as meaningful as you may believe, right now, given the step up that we're experiencing in our content spending. So those two factors, I think are things you had when you consider those factors, relative to where we're today and the other factors you mentioned, I think that gets you to how it gets to $20 billion. John Stankey : I just reinforce the things we shared previously, Colby, around $6 billion margin on the cost structure of which as we've described to you, just correct, we're about a third of the way through that, we've been reinvesting a lot of the improvements that we've been able to drive into the operations so that we can accelerate our market momentum. As we go through the back half of this margin of the second, third, and then the final third, we do expect some of that's going to start hitting our bottom line, we have some of it targeted for how we want to continue to move into the market, but some of it is going to move through our bottom line. And it's going to ultimately be accretive to what we do on cash as we move through that. And that's part of our calculus on this. And Jeff gave you a little bit of a description of some of the things that we're working on. But I would also tell you that a major part of these efforts, and some of the stuff that comes at the back end is restructuring parts of the fixed asset inventory of our company, if you want to think about it in terms of the geographic footprint that we cover on the products that are associated with it, and the operations that are necessary to keep those products up and running. These are pretty fundamental hard things to do, they take a little bit of time, the business is doing them and when they're done, and we move through them, they have a meaningful impact on the cost structure as we move forward. And that's an element and then I look, we have some market momentum in places as we just described you, you heard our comments about where we're in the consumer space and the pivot we made there, we like what we're seeing in the wireless business and think we have a sustainable equation that we can take forward that's going to drive growth in those things. And that's what's going to get us out to those numbers. Jason Kilar : Yes, you remember the guidance is for two years from now that so the first full-year after the WarnerMedia transaction closes. So, we believe we'll grow our remaining business between now and then given the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace. Colby Synesael : Great. And there's just one quick point of clarification, then you were saying then that the one-third done, that's off to $6 billion broader cost savings target? John Stankey : That's right. Colby Synesael : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thanks very much for the questions, Colby. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : And that question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks. And John, congratulations on some pretty radical transformation of the company and strategy and just in the same vein, would it be possible for Dish to light up their spectrum on your passive as well -- sorry, non-passive infrastructure wireless, the RAMs and the antennas relatively quickly, if they wanted to do so and the people that meet them. Pascal Desroches : Yes, that is technically possible. As John pointed out, the industry during the pandemic shared in spectrum to bring it to life to support the needs for broadband. And so there are certain spectral assets that are already engineered with our antennas and our radios that are deployed today. Tim Horan : And with that meet the FCC requirements on build out the Dish has at this point? Pascal Desroches : I'm not going to comment on that. Tim Horan : And then lastly, just on the whole go-to-market strategy, there's something that they may partner with AWS and AWS and other hyperscale has just done a phenomenal job digitizing the customer experience. Have you thought about the point, the same type of real radical digitization for customers, AWS will do same day delivery obviously, and it would really reduce the need for the number of stores that you have, and a lot of other processes you have? Pascal Desroches : We have done much of the very same thing in our operation over the last 18 months. In fact, our call to a higher percentage of our volumes are flowing through digital, we're getting higher gross adds than we ever have before with fewer doors as a result of our operations and our transformation of our distribution channels. And so, yes, we've got teams that that execute against those opportunities day in and day out. John Stankey : Tim, I will tell you, there's a fundamental reengineering going on right now, our supply chain and how we think about the logistics around that supply chain and an element of that is, of course, as we've learned during the pandemic, folks have changed behavior, we've accommodated a lot of that, frankly in terms of how effective we're on an omni channel approach. But we also realize that probably elements of more enhanced servicing and they kind of approach to it are going to be what we need to address going forward. And there's a lot of work underway with that. Tim Horan : Thanks very much for the question. Amir Rozwadowski : I'll turn over to John for our final comments. John Stankey : Look, I'll be real brief. I would say this. I think with yesterday's announcement on RIO and those that came before it, I would say we put the bulk of the framework in place to optimize our execution and performance in the business. And it's as simple as that. And that's what we're focused on. And I'm pleased with the momentum as we begin this chapter. I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning, your interest in the business. I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer and I look forward to speaking with all of you very soon. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of our call are Jeff McElfresh, the CEO of our Communications Group; and Jason Kilar, CEO for WarnerMedia. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. I also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 110. So unfortunately, we can\u2019t answer questions about that today. With that, I'll turn the call over John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll be brief because the quarter is largely more of the same. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of consistent progress since we articulated our simplified business strategy and how we plan to measure our progress going forward. The close of the DIRECTV transaction this quarter is another important step we've completed to reposition AT&T. I acknowledge this makes for some extra cycles on comparative analysis. And as we continue to do so, there'll be fewer moving parts to assess and better visibility and clarity. In the meantime, it's important not to lose sight of the success we're having, deploying capital into our areas of strategic focus. Bottom line, we're accelerating our historical rates of customer growth in Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max, and customer satisfaction is improving across the board with lower churn and higher NPS scores.  Mobility is delivering more postpaid phone customers on a rolling 12-month run rate than it has in the prior decade. Our Fiber products are recognized as best-in-class. As we expand our Fiber footprint, we're delivering a superior service, and we're growing our share. We're already nearing the low-end of our 2021 guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, despite our long-planned intent to no longer cede customer control to Amazon's channels offering. Additionally, customer growth can be attributed in part to our ability to mine out significant cost savings from our operations and reinvest them back into the business.  The results are driving Mobility and Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth that we expect to be complemented by margin expansion, as our transformation work matures. We have clear line of sight to achieving at least half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year, driven by success with a number of initiatives that we believe also will support improving returns in the coming years. Whether they stem from nearly $1 billion of savings from streamlining our field operations, a similar level of savings from changes made to our procurement processes, or a $0.5 billion of savings from the rationalization of our retail store footprint. Our focus on driving out inefficiencies is showing tangible results. These are just a few of the most significant programs underway. More initiatives that we expect will drive incremental savings and operating leverage are in the investment and implementation phase. Finally, as I mentioned, we've closed the DIRECTV transaction and continue to expect the WarnerMedia deal to close by mid-year 2022. With these and other dispositions, we monetized or announced plans to monetize more than $55 billion of assets over the past year. The last five quarters have been a period of repositioning our business while also delivering operational results. With that repositioning nearing completion, that will afford even more focus on continued execution and improved performance.  We're on track to reach our full-year free cash flow guidance in the $26 billion range and we expect to hit the high-end of our adjusted EPS guidance. We're in the early innings of transforming the Company and believe that we have significant opportunity ahead of us to expand, share in our focus areas and drive better returns, including sustained earnings growth. We continue to strive to earn your confidence one quarter at a time, delivering operating performance and shows our momentum is real and sustainable. Let me now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpaid phone net adds. That's our best net adds quarter in over 10 years. Customers like the strength of our network and our consistent simple offers. Gross adds are up, churn is low, and we continue to take share and grow our customer base.  Our Fiber base also continues to expand. Broadband revenues grew by more than 7%, and we now have 5.7 million AT&T Fiber customers, with 3.4 million of them on 1-gig connections. And we saw sequential growth in our Fiber net adds with most of those new to AT&T. Let's now look at our HBO Max, HBO global subscribers. As we said last quarter, most of the subscriber additions for the remainder of the year are expected to come from our lower ARPU international base. We've reached nearly 70 million global subscribers, thanks to growth in our international markets.  As previously announced, domestic subscribers were down due to our proactive decision to shut down the Amazon wholesale platform. This was partially offset by new wholesale relationships. Retail subscriber growth slowed on the timing of new content, but we expect retail subscriber growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter due to strong content slate. We have new seasons of Succession and Curb Your Enthusiasm debuting, the return of Sex and the City, as well as the much anticipated premieres of Dune, King Richard, and The Matrix Resurrection. Given our upcoming content slate and expanding global footprint, we expect to end the year at the higher end of our year-end global subscriber target. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for our consolidated financial results. The third quarter results reflect the closing of the DIRECTV transaction after the first month of the quarter. We're a smaller Company today than we were at the beginning of the quarter, and that is reflected in our results. Excluding DIRECTV revenues, revenues were up about $1.7 billion or 5%, thanks to growth in our market focus areas. Gains in Mobility, WarnerMedia, and Consumer Wireline more than offset declines in Business Wireline and from the disposition of other businesses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.87, that's up more than 14% year-over-year. In addition to merger amortization adjustments for the quarter, adjustments were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, a gain on the sale of Playdemic and an actuarial gain of benefit plans.  When you exclude DIRECTV from both periods, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year, mostly due to growth in Mobility and strong growth at WarnerMedia, reflecting partial recovery from the pandemic and the timing of sports costs. Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Spending was up both year-over-year and sequentially with CapEx of 4$.7 billion and growth capital investments totaling $5.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion inclusive of year-over-year increases of $850 million in CapEx and $1.7 billion investment in WarnerMedia cash content. Year-to-date, our content investment has increased by more than $4 billion. Additionally, our leverage position also benefited from $10 billion in asset monetization in the quarter, including our DIRECTV TPG transaction. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our communication business on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues to gain steam. Revenues were up 7%, with service revenues growing 4.6%. postpaid phone [Indiscernible] remained at record low levels, and we had record postpaid phone growth.  Prepaid also continued to be a solid performer for us, especially our Cricket brand. We added 249,000 prepaid phones in the quarter. Prepaid phone churn is less than 3% with quicker churn even lower. Mobility EBITDA is up nearly $300 million or 3.6% year-over-year, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. We expect that growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter.  This growth came even with increased volumes, 3G shutdown costs of nearly 200 million, higher costs associated with the return of the iPhone launch into the third quarter, and without a material return in international roaming. We expect similar quarterly 3G shutdown costs through the first quarter of 2022. Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins in the high 30s and solid EBITDA.  The business did see some difficult year-over-year comparison given pandemic-related benefits experienced last year. We have been very aggressive in proactively rationalizing our portfolio of low margin products. This creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues, but at the same time, it allows us to focus on our core network and transport services products. It will take several quarters for us to work through this initiative, but as we lap the beginning of this process that began late last year, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline.  Our fiber growth was solid. We had our highest fiber gross adds ever, and we continue to win share wherever we have fiber, we added 289,000 fiber customers in the quarter. And more than 70% of fiber net adds are new AT&T broadband customers and discuss this great confidence as we continue to build up our fiber footprint. Last quarter, we reached a major inflection point in our consumer wireline business where broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy decline. Total consumer wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 3.4%.  This quarter also reached an inflection point on broadband profits as EBITDA grew 3.8%. We expect sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, but it will be a tougher year-over-year comparison due to a onetime pandemic related benefit in last year's fourth quarter. Let's move to WarnerMedia results which are on Slide 8. WarnerMedia revenues were up 14% led by strong D2C growth and content licensing. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenues grew about 25% reflecting the continued success of HBO Max.  Content and other revenues were up 32%, reflecting higher TV licensing and the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. Advertising revenues were down nearly 12%, mostly due to the timing of sports. You may recall that the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA season and the playoffs, which returned to a more traditional schedule this year. This lowered sports costs in the quarter, which helped WarnerMedia grow EBITDA by 13.5%. The third quarter also included the impact of more than 200 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing costs. With the close of the DIRECTV transaction, WarnerMedia continues to represent and sell DIRECTV advertising inventory and now compensates DIRECTV through a revenue share arrangement. This revenue share is now recorded as an expense to WarnerMedia. We launched HBO Max in Latin America late June and have had incredible success.  And next week, we are launching new international markets in Spain and the Nordic region with more new markets to come in 2022. Now before we get to your questions, just a few words about guidance. Three quarters into the year, we feel good about customer momentum and where we stand relative to our guidance provided last quarter. With our strong performance, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth range.  And that's with significant costs expected to be incurred in launching HBO Max in Europe. Additionally, we expect more than 350 million of advertising sharing costs associated with WarnerMedia 's new advertising sharing arrangement with DIRECTV, as well as continued costs associated with shutting down our 3G network. Also, keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter benefited from the advertising associated with the U.S. presidential election.  And as mentioned earlier, we are on track with our free cash flow target of around $26 billion as well. In addition to the fourth quarter being a traditionally stronger free cash flow quarter, we expect a FirstNet reimbursement of approximately $1 billion, lower year-over-year costs from the iPhone launch, moving up to the third quarter this year, and DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately 800 million. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : And our first question today comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Good morning, guys. With the inflection in the consumer market, the business segment is clearly what's keeping the communications business from generating positive EBITDA. And I know you guys had some tough comps and Pascal, thanks for the comments on the revenue growth improvement. But when can we see -- start to see some EBITDA improvement? Any sort of color or granularity you can give there that get us to the point where the communications business is growing EBITDA.  And then maybe for Jason, can you give us any color on the AVOD launch this summer? And it looks like you guys added 6 million to 7 million HBO Max subs globally if you net out the Amazon losses. Is that - a, is that in the ballpark? And b, does the content release schedule that you guys mentioned, does it allow you to sort of build on that number as we go into the last quarter of the year? Thanks. John Stankey : Hey, John, let me start before Jason jumps in. Overall, here's the way to think about. We haven't given specific guidance on the overall communications Company yet, which is what I think you're asking about. But I said in my commentary that we expect Mobility, the biggest part of our business to accelerate growth from here. I also said that, well, sequentially, we have some tough comps. For the fourth quarter Consumer Wireline, we expect sequential growth in that business. Business Wireline, we talked about some of the issues we're facing. So when you think about all those things, you should get a sense that from here, the momentum of the business continues. And we feel really good about it, our customers are growing, our revenues are growing, and we continue to take costs out of the business. So over time, it's going to translate to improvement in, not only top line, but we will see profit growth. John Hodulik : Thanks. Jason Kilar : John, I'll jump in. This is Jason on the AVOD question, which is -- we've been happy with the launch, which was in June of this year. So this is the first full quarter. And we're happy, not just in terms of the absolute response, in terms of subscribers, but also because advertising helps lower the price and increase the value for an HBO Max subscription. So we see it as rather strategic. and we're very excited about where that goes.  One thing that is interesting to note, John, is that until the end of the year, there is a slight difference in the product of ad-supported HBO Max in that the movies, specifically Matrix, King Richard, and Dune are not part of the ad-supported offering. So there will be full content parity starting in late January of 2022. So we're very happy with the results and we're quite excited about the future as well. And then you also asked about our results, if you assume taking into account the Amazon Prime Video channels exit.  We haven't commented specifically on the size of the subscribers coming from Amazon Prime Video channels, but I think it's safe to say that we're very happy with the quarter. When you think about how we've grown, 1.9 million worldwide, and even when you think about the Amazon exit, which we think was a very strategic decision that three companies really have made so far, which includes Disney and Netflix being the other two, we feel very good about the quarter. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys Jeff Mc Elfresh : Thanks very much, John. Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. I wonder if you can talk on your view on the wireless industry. Clearly, your business you've talked about, is accelerating. But there's a thesis out there that there are huge subsidies in for consumers that are damaging industry health. Do you think investors are wrong on that, and that the wireless industry is healthy? And with churn low, does it make sense to back off a bit on growth to push margin? Thanks. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Yeah. Hey, Phil, this is Jeff. Good morning. Phil Cusick : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Mc Elfresh : To address that question, I'd kind of backup for a second and look at the health of our Wireless business in the context of the overall industry and tell you that our strategy is working here at AT&T as we've demonstrated, it's the 5th consecutive quarter where we have driven some momentum in gaining share. Our net add strength here in the quarter at 928,000, that compares to what we have produced back in 2019 in the third quarter of 101,000.  And we're driving strong service revenue growth and we just posted the largest total EBITDA that we've generated out of the Wireless business segment. The best part about it, Phil, is that our customers are telling us that we're doing a good job. These churn levels that are low are a signal to the service and the value that we're offering, and our NPS feedback that we've received is the highest that we've ever received. The sustainability of what we've done here in AT&T, I think, is really important to understand more broadly. It's a question that keeps coming up about our growth, relative to competition in the general market. It's important to note that we've optimized our distribution channels. We've expanded the reach of it and we're now addressing new segments that we were not addressing earlier, and that's helping us drive some of our customer momentum. But in combination to that, Phil, we've simplified our rate plans and we've remained consistent in our offers to the market over the last 13 months, if you will.  And this really enables the AT&T frontline team members to master their craft, deliver a higher level of service. And that -- this can't be overlooked, this is a key component to what's driving momentum for us at AT&T in our business. I'd also point to things like our FirstNet program. We're starting to reach some scale here. Third quarter, we posted the highest net add quarter since launching the program. And we've arrived at a position of leadership and strength in the law enforcement segment under that public safety sector. And so all in all, it's been the operational changes that we've made at AT&T that has driven really strong momentum in our customer counts. The promotions that you referred to, there's an aspect of promotion that's just one element of this broader strategy. And it's important to note that not all of our customers that are with us, that upgrade or that join us from competitors, take advantage of the promotional offers that you see in the market.  We've been at this for a little over a year now. And I can tell you I've studied the characteristics of the customers that have taken the promotion versus those that have not taken the promotion in our customer base. And here's what I can tell you, that those that have participated in our promotional offers have a higher LTV, a better churn and a higher satisfaction score than those that have not. And so, we know this is driving accretive value. The industry is healthy. And better than that, the new accounts to AT&T, those that are joining us from our competitors, they exhibit the same kind of characteristics in their financials, higher LTVs, better churn, and higher satisfaction than our base. So it's not just that we are adding more customers, we know based on these metrics that we see that we are adding high-value customers and don't believe that this is driven uniquely by any kind of subsidy or extra cash flow that happens to be in the marketplace of the general market. It's also, I think, important to fill the note that the cost of these promotions as one element of our strategy, it runs through our service revenue. The cost of those promotions run through that in amortization, and so for us to be able to post this kind of growth in the quarter, in this competitive market, and drive this kind of solid performance in subscriber revenue, accounting for any cost of the promotions gives us confidence that we're creating value. I would take this kind of quarter all day long in the competitive market, and I'm certain that our shareholders are going to be happy with it. John Stankey : Phil, I'll just add on that. We're not participating or taking EBB dollars on our postpaid subscribers. And I would say in terms of telecommunications in general, in the health, there's clearly a stronger consumer out there because of some of the things that the federal government has done with the pandemic to prop-up household income and that's not -- can't last forever.  However, if you kind of examine where we are in the infrastructure bill, and you think about what is moving from a federal policy perspective on building better infrastructure, whether or not congress gets that through of course is a question, but you work under assumption that there seems to be some bipartisan view that we need to do the right things around infrastructure and then broad band and connectivity to the Internet seems to come at the top of the list.  I would expect that there's going to be some more federal money that moves into the industry next year. And some of it comes in the form of a direct subsidy to what's considered to be low-income households. That definition of low-income households is a fairly generous definition. It's 200% of the poverty line in the bill as it was proposed or written. When you start thinking about that, does that mean that a household, at least in terms of making decisions on telecommunications purchases, might be in a strong perspective next year, the economy continues to be reasonably strong, I don't worry about all of a sudden seeing a reversal or turn around in the aggregate spending power on telecommunication services. Phil Cusick : I appreciate the depth of your answer. I would only follow-up -- and Jeff, I think everybody has been pretty impressed with the results of AT & T over the last year. I would only follow up that the market is telling you that investors don't believe it. Not necessarily about AT&T, but look at the stock price of AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile together. And investors are discounting the terminal value of these Company is pretty massively. And so more detail on that over time might be really helpful. Jason Kilar : I think our job is to do what we say we're going to do each quarter, and continue to meet our commitments and carry it through and ultimately over time, that when the cash shows up, it tends to get reflected in the stock price. Phil Cusick : Thanks, guys. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Phil. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Thanks for the update on the WarnerMedia transaction. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more on when we might learn more about the final structure of the deal at the dividend policy, etc. Any color there would be great. And then on the supply chain, can you just revisit the fiber build pacing on the 2.5 million and just general commentary on what you're seeing in the supply chain and how that's impacting both fiber 5G rollouts? Thanks. John Stankey : Sure, Simon. It's nice to hear you. Thanks for joining us today. Simon Flannery : Thank you. John Stankey : The general progress on the deal, I think is consistent with what we would have expected as we walked into it. As we indicated in our opening remarks, we're moving through the steps with the various regulatory agencies, both domestically in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Those processes are moving along at the pace we would've expected. I don't see any surprises around it, as you might guess, regulatory agencies are doing their typical thorough overview around that. And we feel really comfortable around the back-and-forth and what's been produced, the timelines and the milestones we've hit around those things. I would not expect that we would be giving details around our view of the construct of the deal until we're a little further along in that process and we have some degree of visibility that we know that there is going to be a positive affirmation of the deal coming out. and we're getting into that.  Let's call it the window where we know we're in the final back-and-forth could try to get either a consent decree or approval, whichever comes out of it, to get the transaction moving forward. You probably are going around the deals long enough to know that we're not at that point right now and we're probably not going to be at that point until we get into the early part of next year. And once we have some visibility around that and we can step back at that moment, look at where the stock price is, how things are standing in the market at that point in time. And we're starting to get down to that window where people would need to make a decision, then we'll be giving you some visibility around what we think the right path forward is around that. And obviously, we want to see what also transpires here in Washington over the next couple of months. There's chances that policy may change around how different types of distributions or different approaches get taxed and all that has to be factored into our overall equation of how do we get value back into the shareholder's pocket in the right way. And the more information we have around that, the better informed that'll be, and I think the better it will be for shareholders as they move through it. But of course, there will be noticed before we close the transaction.  I just wouldn't expect that it's going to be months and months and months before we'd close the transaction because we obviously want some degree of regulatory certainty. And where we are with the bill, you know what, the first thing I would probably share with everybody is, we're on this path to substantially increase our fiber foot print and that stretches across both our consumer and our business base.  And I think as you known from past history, this is not uncommon for us to go through these ramps of infrastructure builds. We've done that many times before. We've recently been through 1 where we went through a multi-year ramp on Fiber builds that we started executing around the 2015 timeframe.  They always, as you move through the front end of them, have a few moments where they're a little bit lumpy and a little bit rocky, because that's the nature of it. These are inherently large civil construction projects and they're spread out across many municipalities and there's many permitting agencies and all kinds of things that go on. And getting everybody ginned up and ready to go at scale sometimes takes some steps, but the end of the day, we always get there. And I think what's important for the investors to understand is we're on this march to get ourselves into a position where we can deploy fiber at scale and move from where we are right now, which is we want an objective of about 3 million passing a year and we'll ultimately probably ramp that into 5. We're looking at other options to see if there is capital efficient ways for us to even take that up a little bit further and do more, but we will get there. And I would ask that we probably not rotate on any given 90-day period as to whether or not it was a good 90 days or a bad 90 days. It's a question around whether or not we scale this up and get to the point that we're starting to deliver new homes into the inventory in a regular fashion, and I'm absolutely convinced that the organization is doing that. Are we seeing some supply stress right now in certain places as part of the reason why we guided down to 2.5 million this year? The answer to that is, yes, it's coming in interesting places.  But the great news is when you are the scale player in the market, we work through those faster and with the preferred position than others. And we're seeing that occur, whether its chip sets for gateways and the homes that are necessary to put a Wi-Fi infrastructure and a motive in place, or it's Fiber components that are necessary or access to civil engineering. I think we're working through all those in a respectable fashion. I can give you an example right now.  One of the reasons that we had to kind of deal with a guide down was one of our fiber providers was struggling a little bit in getting us the prefabricated portions of the infrastructure that go out into the distribution plant. The last mile, if you will, the parts that go up and down alleys and streets that ultimately connect homes into the network. And there is pre -assembled components that come in that, that are pre -spliced, that are put out into the network as we receive them from the manufacturer.  We have worked through a lot of those issues and we in fact have an awful lot of infrastructure, if not all of the 2.5 million that will be placed, but there is a connector piece of that infrastructure that moves from the optical node that ultimately ties that in to the distribution neighborhood, which we're running a little bit short on right now. And it's literally a very small section of fiber that splices in the larger distribution. It's frankly the larger distribution that's harder to deploy.  There's more labor hours in it. It's what requires more permits and more activity out in neighborhoods. But it's that little connector piece that we're a little bit short on right now. We're working through with the manufacturer in a cooperative way. We have a lot of plans in place to get that done and get the work completed. But it's one of those things where it's going to be nip and tuck right up until the end of everything we put in. But if for some reason we fall a little short on that, we're not talking about missing the substantial portion of the labor, we're talking about missing a connector that has to be put in that can bring up a lot of houses every time we put 1 more of those on the network. So we feel good about the ramp. We're going to continue to ramp or we're going to continue to give you insights to the new homes that are coming in.  And we also believe we're in a very unique position given that we are the largest provider and builder of fiber out there right now that we're in strength in the industry and what we can command. And that's supply chain and we've secured the right relationships to get that done. Simon Flannery : Thanks for the color, John. Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Yeah, thanks. And two more for Jason. Last month at our Communacopia Conference, David Zaslav indicated that they would likely be taking a bit of a more targeted approach to deploying Discovery Plus ahead of the merger closing. I'm curious, have you or do you intend to modify the rollout or go-to-market plans on HBO Max ahead of the merger? And if so, can you give us an example what that means?  I guess I'm just curious whether the current run rate of subscriber growth might actually understate the underlying momentum of the business if you were going to market the way you would expect after the merger. And then the second question is, you're nearly a year into the stay-in - date strategy with HBO Max and theaters. I'm curious what you've learned, maybe the biggest surprise and then more broadly, how has this experienced shape your view on the role of the theatrical distribution in sort of a post COVID, DTC driven world. Thanks. Jason Kilar : Sure thing, Brett. Very much appreciate the questions. In terms of your first question, our approach is consistent with what our approach was a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, 3 quarters ago. And what I mean by that is that for us it's business as usual. We're going to be launching in 6 countries. next week in Europe, and we're very excited about that, and we've also publicly announced a number of other European country launches in 2022. So our approach is very much what it had been before. And we're excited.  If you take a look at the Latin America results, what expansion across the globe can bring. In terms of your second question about our motion picture slate and what have we learned. I'll state the obvious, which is not unique to us is that, we're in the middle of a pandemic and a pandemic obviously presents very unique circumstances.  And as you know well, we've been very much leading and the first over the wall, so to speak, in terms of bringing our 2021 slate to customers in a way that can work for them, but also worked for exhibition and work for our participants. And so what we've learned is that motion pictures continue to matter.  We believe they're going to matter for decades to come, and we're probably investing in them. In terms of the road forward, we've committed to 2022, and that's the visibility that we have, and that is a combination of two things; on one side will be a certain slate of motion pictures that will have an exclusive theatrical run, 45 days that's quite a bit different from where things were, say, 5 years ago in terms of the theatrical run, then they will come to HBO Max. And then we're also going to have a slate of motion pictures from Warner Brothers that will come directly to HBO Max on day 1. That's -- those are the answers to your two questions, Brett. Thank you for asking. John Stankey : Put an exclamation point on your first question, which is, we absolutely believe and did this transaction with the notion that we're moving this business forward in a direct-to-consumer marketplace, and it's required that you get to scale. And I've said multiple times that we're in a window here where that's a foot race, and it's an important foot race. So there's no pulling the foot off the accelerator on that regard.  HBO Max is the foundation of that business moving forward and how the combined Company will continue to go to market and everything that we do right now to make that product better and add customers is a step in the right direction and the consistent direction of where the closed and combined business goes.  And we all want the shareholders that own a substantial portion of that Company moving forward, to have a valuable asset, one that's growing and one that will be successful in the next-generation of media. And we believe we've got to do the right things right now to make sure that the business is well-positioned, to make that happen. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Brett. Operator can we shift to the next question. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America, please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions -- 2, if I could. The first one, Pascal, I think, for you; the way that the industry is growing ARPU has been moving meter plans to unlimited, unlimited to premium unlimited. You called out that now that we're at the end of year 1 of the promotional retention discounts that you guys are offering, the amortization of those discount in ARPU is starting to be felt in a 60 basis point year-over-year decline. David Barden : Can you give us a feeling for how we should expect these two forces to work against one another as year 2 and year 3 see these promotional discounts compound as a headwind, assuming you continue down this path and the runway you have to try to offset that with core growth, recognizing of course that it's just an accounting issue.  And then the second question would be, you mentioned that you've taken a year's worth of initiatives to try to improve the business revenue trajectory, could you give us a picture of what has happened and what change do you expect to see in the business outlook? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Dave, on the latter question, you're talking about Business Wireline? David Barden : Correct. Pascal Desroches : Okay. Let me start, and Jeff will probably chime in on a few items. Remember, as we -- as we've said, the promotions that we are doing, 1, not all customers are taking them, so that's a big factor to keep in mind. 2, yes, the amortization is growing, but the ARPU -- the cash ARPU, is there. And when you couple the increased -- the continued vibrant cash ARPU with the expense work that we are doing in the middle of the P&L, we expect to grow both top line and bottom line as we move forward.  And yeah, there will be some slight degradation in ARPU, but if -- when you look at our overall ARPU, we're still at the high end of the industry, so that's a consideration to keep in mind. These are very profitable lifetime value subscribers. As it relates to Business Wireline, we started about a year ago, started to rationalize low profit margin products and services, and that effort continues. The goal would be, over time, more and more of our services in the enterprise space are going to come from our core connectivity product, whether it be wireless or fiber. And that's where the growth is going to come. And it's a process we are partway through, but we think as you get through the latter part of this year to early next year, the comps get a little bit easier. I'll ask Jeff to chime in. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Thanks Pascal. If you look at our Business Wireline business as a reported segment wise, we are moving our customers --many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while. I think it's important to note that unlike others, we don't report a consolidated business P&L, that includes wireless. And we are actually seeing shift to wireless for many services, as many of our customers have moved up and over in the pandemic. As just a general observation. More specifically, David, the three parts of our business that we're getting to subscriber growth, revenue growth, and then EBITDA growth. We've got, first to our business wire -- our Consumer Wireline and our Mobility moving in that direction. And we are at the cusp of getting our Business Wireline business to move in that direction. It's going to take some time because it's going to require some product mix and product development work. Specifically, areas of the business markets that we, at AT&T, serve less of, or underrepresented, are in more of the medium-sized businesses in the mid-market. And these customers are more inclined to use shared broadband served up by Fiber. And our business service are class services that we sell to our top-end enterprise accounts are a bit more bespoke in specific networks that are not necessarily attractive to the mid-markets. We have been making moves to shift the product mix into mid, and as John mentioned earlier, as our fiber expansion, it's not just for consumer but also for business, begins to take footing, you'll see us shift shares of our revenue in Business Wireline more transactional based and down market with the execution that we know we can deliver, and so it's going to take a few quarters as we work through it. The cost transformation that we're undertaking inside the communications Company, as Pascal mentioned, about halfway through the 6 billion and aggregate for the firm. The back half of the transformation program really brings in more operating efficiencies in our Business Wireline segment that we we'll see start to accrete to EBITDA growth in that part of our business. David Barden : Thanks for answering the question. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, David. Operator, if we can move to the next caller. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good morning. Just wanted to follow up, and forgive me if you mentioned a little of this earlier, but I just wanted to unpack this a little bit further. In terms of the Wireless business, what you're seeing in terms of the right plan participation for unlimited plans and the higher value plans, and how much opportunity is in front of the Company to upsell customers on these higher-value plans that you've been marketing. And then just secondly, back in -- I think it was March at the Analyst Day, AT&T set a goal for net debt to end the year at 154 billion at three times leverage, which infers, you can just divide the three into the net debt, it's about 51.3 billion of EBITDA [Indiscernible] for the year. And since then, it seems like your cost cutting program is moving faster. Just curious, if you can give us an update on these goals. And is that the right bouncing off point to think about the AT&T EBITDA without DIRECTV for 2021? Thanks. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Mike, I'll take the first part of your question. This is Jeff. There still remains a large opportunity within our base of customers to work them through a more value -- higher end of our rate plans. And you're seeing that play out in postpaid phone ARPU. Pascal touched on this a second ago. If you think about maintaining the industry-leading, the highest ARPU of any player in the market, even though we're the third player in wireless, being able to do that with some of these promotional offers that are part of our strategy, gives us confidence that we're working our base and our customers up the ARPU stack into higher-value unlimited rate plans. We still have large portions of our subscriber base that we have not migrated into those rate plans. And so we expect that to continue pretty much on the course and speed of what the customer wants. We're not driving or forcing any unnatural behavior there. We're letting the customers choose when it's time for them to take advantage of an offer or to move into a new rate plan. And we'll continue to execute that. So that's got a room to run for the next mini, several quarters. That's not something that's going to dry up in the short-term. Pascal Desroches : Mike, a couple of things to keep in mind. While we didn't -- we're not updating that guidance. We feel comfortable with it. If you want to get to a sense for what the base business is, post DPV, and WarnerMedia which, I think all the information is out there. We've provided, for WarnerMedia, we report the results separately, so those are very easily discernible. And then if you look at DPV, we provided extensive pro - forma. The thing to keep in mind is, when we compute net debt to EBITDA, we use the trailing 12 months. In this instance, some of it included DTV for part of the year, and it doesn't include DTV for another part of the year. That's how you're getting to your 3 times -- that's how we get to 3 times in the guidance we provided. But other than that, we're not changing the guidance. We think that should get you in the zone, and if you have any further questions, I'm sure the IR team can walk you through it. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Mike. Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So I guess if I could just dig in to the fiber business a little bit more. Is there any change in terms of the go-to-market strategy? I think you guys tweaked the pricing plans, if I'm not wrong, during Q3. But more broadly, if you could give us some color around what part of this origination also includes bundles with wireless and the acceleration in growth in fiber? Kannan Venkateshwar : You guys have been building out Fiber for a while as a part of the DTV deal and some of that was overlapped with your DSL footprint, but in that overlap, you did not seem to get the same kind of success that you're getting right now. If you could just expand on the differences in go-to-market as well as the customer cohorts that you're targeting and how you expect that to evolve, that will be useful. Thanks. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Kannan, hey, it's Jeff. What has been our difference in go-to-market strategy? We are executing at a faster pace in this build than we did in the prior build. Our -- in fact, the gross additions that we had in our fiber business in the third quarter, roughly around 500,000, highest ever. Our network engineering teams are getting the fiber laid into the ground, into customer homes, in a cycle time that's about 30% faster than our prior build. And our market or -- marketing organization is tactically out in the markets driving early 30, 60, 90 day [Indiscernible] rates at 2x the levels that we saw in the prior build. We are absolutely including wireless as a bundled opportunity for us in this part of our footprint. And I'd cite that about 7 out of 10 additions to our Fiber network in this last quarter were new accounts to AT&T, and therefore, give us an opportunity to go drive Mobility growth as well. in the footprints where we built it. John Stankey : Can I just emphasize something Jeff said and maybe we'll quibble a little bit with your characterization of the previous success on the quote, unquote, the last bill. There was really not much new fiber build from about 2018 at the end of 2018, for there's a little bit of a hiatus period there, so I would tell you that a lot of the results you're seeing right now to just point, it's really better execution of the team. Going back in and working in some of the asset base to actually improve performance overall.  Yes. Now, the midpoint of this year, you've now seen some of your inventory come into play and we're getting a lot better, as Jeff just described, at moving through penetration rates faster. And if we, in fact, sustain that it's going to make the business case even a stronger business case because one of the big sensitivities to payback is rate to penetration. And if we can keep that going, it can be dramatically better than what we think is already a pretty attractive business case. And the last point I would make is, the nice part about this build in many instances is, that we're filling in a little bit of areas that we maybe didn't complete previously. And so as that fill in occurs, you get some effectiveness on marketing messages, the ability to go into a market and it's your particular value proposition effectively communicated, how you deal with your distribution channels through that. So we'll probably be a little bit more effective and efficient given the base of customers that we have as we build out and fill in over the next several quarters. Kannan Venkateshwar : Got it. Can I just follow-up? I mean, in terms of your go-to-market strategy in Wireless, the device promotions obviously helped quite a bit over the course of the last year. When we look at the broadband side of the business, the current pricing structure and the promotional structure that you have, should we basically think of that as the operating steady-state or are you thinking more broadly about potentially a different kind of pricing and promotional structure to accelerate this growth? Jeff Mc Elfresh : [Indiscernible] right now given the demand that we have for this best-in-class product, that's 4.5 times better than our nearest competitor, and the quality of the products, and the value that we offer into the market. We like the demand that we're generating. This business is about getting Fiber built as quickly as we can to serve these customers, to give them gigabit level speeds at a really solid price point. I wouldn't anticipate any change or move so long as our offer in the market continues to gain customers. Kannan Venkateshwar : Got it. Thank you, guys. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks for answering the question, Kannan. Operator, if we can move to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Can you walk us through your fixed wireless strategy and what percentage of the demand do you think for that product comes from enterprises versus consumer? And then also curious on the outlook for wholesale on Wireless. You potentially lose some share against the TracFone over time, but what about wholesale deals with either Lex like that to try and boost that business? Thanks. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Hey, Frank, it's Jeff. Right now for our broadband business, as you know, we're focused on fiber, but we do offer some fixed wireless services and it's predominantly focused today in the enterprise segment where most of those clients are looking for a 4G or 5G wireless backhaul. We are experimenting, as is everyone else, in leveraging our scale d wireless network to maybe augment pocket scenarios with some fixed wireless. but it honestly is not a lead product for us, and we won't make that top of the funnel for our broadband services. Your second part of the question was what, Frank? Frank Louthan : On the wholesale side and Wireless, potentially lose some share over time with TracFone deal. And what are your thoughts on growing that business, possibly offering wholesale deals to other smaller [Indiscernible] that are building broadband and so forth as to kind of boost that wholesale revenue over time? Jeff Mc Elfresh : Well, for sure, all of our network assets, we're looking to maximize the yield. And because of the investments that we've made in Wireless, Frank, we've got ample capacity sitting inside of our broad network architecture and infrastructure. And so akin to what we have announced previously with DISH, which by the way is operationally up and running.  We've successfully integrated our systems with the DISH systems and now providing connections into their distribution network, and we're going to look to ramp that in B&O offering for DISH over the course of the '22 and beyond. Remind you that's 10-year deals as long term. And so based on that move, you should expect that we are interested in serving all forms of traffic, so long as they are accretive to our share owners and to our business, and I would expect you'll see us as a participant in that. If you look also -- one last comment, Frank, if you look at historically, we've been pretty underrepresented in resale or wholesale in our run rates of our business, and so it's been an area of focus for the team and we'll look to grow that line in our business. Frank Louthan : Right. Great. That's helpful, thanks, Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Frank. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : And that last question will be coming from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the $6 billion cost reduction initiative. How long will it take to achieve that the back half of that goal? Secondly, would you expect this to actually result in margin accretion or will the majority of this be reinvested? And then I guess third on that, what segments are we really going to see that show up in that? You mentioned, I think, Business Wireline, But is there any others that will be fairly material, as well?  And just real quickly, John, in one of your comments, you mentioned going from 3 million to 5 million homes pass per year with Fiber. I just hadn't heard that 5 million number before, is that new or is that always there? And is that just simply intended to get you to catch up to get to that 30 million home pass long-term goal or is there an expectation that you're going to go well beyond that 30 million that you had previously mentioned? Thank you. John Stankey : Colby, I've been pretty clear from the front end of this, is my view is, our job is to execute, and return to you a result that you look at and say those are really impressive and that's great and that the business, to the extent that we do that. I fully believe there's more opportunity for us to go out, and continue to build infrastructure that's highly capable that can attract business and I think my belief is that this management team, as we demonstrate the market, we can do that.  Do I believe there is an opportunity for us as a Company to operate at a 5 million a year range at capacity in what we do? I think we can get there. How we get there, and how we scale to that and what timeframe, we'll be an [Indiscernible] of what we come back to you and tell you in terms of our results, and how much progress we're making around them, and we're going to continue to push forward. But as I work with the management team internally, it's how I'm asking them to think about scaling up their business, running their business, sizing their business, creating vendor relationships that allow us to move that path. And that's the -- it's up to us to execute around that to get there. The last -- I'll make a comment just on the other piece and then turn it to Jeff to get to the bulk of it. We've given you guidance on cash flow for 2022, 2023, and there's obviously questions that many of you are asking, well, can they get to that level? And you better believe some of the cost savings stuff is dropping to the bottom line because that's how we get to that level. The backend of this program -- while we've used the front end of it to actually increase our market effectiveness and be in a better position in terms of our customer growth and volume, the backend of this program is about actually getting the better efficiency that drops to the bottom line, that ultimately comes in play and helps us on a cash flow side. And I think that's how you should think about how we've done that.  And there's some structural approaches that we're using on the higher longer term issues like changing that IT infrastructure and data structures, etc. that's harder and longer work, but tends to also have more operating leverage once it goes into service and we get it done, and that's really what's underneath. Jeff, why don't you go ahead and fill in any additional color you might want to add on timing. Jeff Mc Elfresh : Yeah. And it's not only impacting our Business Wireline part of the franchise, Colby, it's all 3 reported segments. I think we've been investing heavily in these transformation initiatives to go drive growth and improve our cost structure and our effectiveness as an organization. Simply put, we have been hard at work inside of the Company preparing for a better execution and a better operating performance. And we're seeing signs of that in our Wireless business, we're seeing signs of this now in our Consumer Wireline business, and I tell you that the Business Wireline begins to feather in as we move into the back half of the program. John Stankey : Okay. With that, first of all, thank you all for joining us this morning and appreciate your questions and your interest in the business. And as I said at the start of the call, I think in some respects, the quarter is more of the same. It's been consistent focus and consistent execution. And I would say I'm really pleased with our progress overall, and how the team is executing.  There are a lot of moving parts and there have been some distractions, but I really am pleased across-the-board, whether in the communications Company or the media Company, the teams have done a remarkable job at staying focused on what their task is at hand. And I only get more excited about that, because as we work our way through this process, and some of those distractions drop away, I think the sky is the one that -- in terms of what these teams can do, with even better execution as they hit their stride around things.  The comment that Phil made, I guess where I would come out on my point of view of these markets that we're involved in, is I'm actually much more bullish and optimistic about the markets in aggregate. I think there's a reason. There's a substantial amount of investment moving into these industries and it's because there's a tremendous importance and an inherent value that customers get out of connectivity moving forward.  And if I were to think about our businesses on the communication side of the Company, we are moving into what I would call the golden age of connectivity and ubiquity and connectivity. I actually feel really optimistic about that, that there's some really smart operators in this industry. They're investing because they have a path to gain return on those things and they're going to do it in a way that's intelligent, smart. And demand is strong in these industries, and I believe there may be some structural changes that come out of some of the programs that the government is looking at that could make that demand even stronger and more robust. And I believe that if policy is structured appropriately in this country right now, we can see a really strong forward progress in the communications industry that's good for all of us. On the media side, I think we are in a very, very unique position with what we've done. We set out, as we started HBO Max, with a description of a product that we thought was going to be different, was going to be a more focused product with a higher degree of quality and a more distinct brand characterization of what we did moving forward.  I think if you go out and you look at any third-party that's been evaluating that as the team has gained its stride, and continue to iterate on the quality of the product, the quality of the platform, as we move through the pandemic in terms of our ability to bring new content out of the market, ratings of engagement and viewership, awards that have come in, indications of time engaged on the platform from third-parties, have all been recognizing the team on that work, and I absolutely believe it is a unique breed of [Indiscernible] that when combined with Discovery moving forward, will only strengthen its capabilities to become one of the must-have platforms of consumers moving forward and a tremendous amount of value creation as that customer basis established globally.  So with that, we'll talk to you as we wrap up the year. Expect to come back and tell you more of the same, and I hope you all have a great fourth quarter and great holidays if I don't talk to you before then. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. In addition, the FCC Spectrum Auction 110 results have been announced, but we're still in the quiet period, so we're limited in what we can say. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're all doing well, and a belated Happy New Year to all of you. 1.5 years ago, we began simplifying our business strategy to reposition AT&T for growth. As you can imagine, this was a significant undertaking requiring us to not only focus our operational efforts toward growing customers, but also doing so in a manner that set us up for an improved profit trajectory in the coming years. Simultaneously, we took on the task of structuring our communications, video and media businesses in a manner that ensured their future success with the right capital structures, access to capital and most importantly, the ability to drive better returns in a manner consistent with their respective market opportunities. I'm pleased with the results our teams delivered last quarter, last year, and for the last six quarters while this repositioning was underway. We finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships, achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across Mobility, fiber and HBO Max. In Mobility, strong network performance and a consistent go-to-market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds. That's more customers than we added in the prior 10 years combined. We achieved this growth the right way with full year Mobility EBITDA up about $1 billion. In fiber, we ended the year with a great build velocity, passing more than 2.6 million additional customer locations. We added more than 1 million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth. We also surpassed our high-end guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021, more than any year in HBO's history. HBO Max and HBO now reaches a base of 73.8 million subscribers globally. WarnerMedia is well positioned as a dynamic global business. In addition to growing customer relationships, we also continue to make great progress in repositioning our operations to be more effective and efficient. We achieved more than half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target, which we've reinvested into operations supporting our growth. This includes simplifying and enhancing our customer experience, which has resulted in higher customer self-service, lower customer churn and greatly improved Mobility NPS and industry-leading fiber NPS. We also continue to rationalize our low-margin Business Wireline services as we reinvest savings into segments that support improving returns. And you're familiar with the significant steps we've taken to reposition the company's assets for future success from our U.S. video assets in Vrio to our pending WarnerMedia transaction. Together, these and other asset monetizations will generate more than $50 billion, and AT&T shareholders will own 71% of one of the world's foremost media companies in the new Warner Bros. Discovery at close. We also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow, nearly $27 billion in 2021, a number we feel good about when looking at our business after the WarnerMedia transaction. So to summarize, we did what we said we were going to do last year. I'm really proud of what our team has accomplished, and we're very pleased with the momentum we have. Turning the page to this year, we'll be consistent in focusing on these same three operational and business priorities. Now that our asset disposition initiatives are largely complete, I expect we'll take our execution to the next level. To that end, we're encouraged with how the process for the WarnerMedia deal is progressing and now expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. Going forward, we aim to be America's best broadband provider powered by 5G and fiber and defined by greater ubiquity, reliability, capacity and speed. We're confident we can achieve that because in wireless, our focus will be continuing our subscriber momentum while increasing the pace of our 5G deployment. We're confident in our ability to compete with 5G and our disciplined approach to selectively targeting and taking share in underpenetrated segments of the consumer and business marketplace. While we're still in the quiet period, I can share that we're very pleased with the results of Spectrum Auction 110. We received 40 megahertz of quality mid-band spectrum that we can begin to put into service this year, and we plan to efficiently deploy it with our C-band spectrum using just one tower climb. We're on track to cover 200 million POPs using mid-band spectrum by the end of 2023. And our network is only going to get better as we effectively deploy our new spectrum holdings. In wired broadband, we have the fastest-growing fiber network and expect to capitalize on the expansion of our fiber footprint and accelerate subscriber growth. The best-in-class experience we provide is getting even better with our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest Internet to AT&T fiber customers with symmetrical 2-gig and 5-gig speed tiers. This will truly differentiate how our customers experience the Internet. Coming off an outstanding year with HBO Max, we plan to hand off the business with a strong exit velocity, and we look to further our international momentum and deliver more world-class content for viewers. When the deal closes, the investments made in both content and HBO Max growth, coupled with strong execution by the team, will ensure Warner Bros. Discovery is positioned as a leading global media company with the depth of content and the capabilities required to lead in the next era of media. As we expand our customer base, we'll continue to responsibly remove costs from the business. We have a clear line of sight to achieving more than 2/3 of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. And importantly, we expect the CD savings start to fall to our bottom line beginning in the back half of the year. Our increased ability to reinvest in our business will fuel growth and allow us to deliver an even better customer experience as we further improve NPS and sustain low churn levels. As we expand our fiber reach, we'll be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity and stabilize our Business Wireline unit by growing connectivity with small to midsized businesses. We also plan to use our strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position. We're now at the dawn of a new age of connectivity where customers want more consolidated and integrated offers, and we're well positioned to meet that demand. Our 5G network is already the best and most reliable. And it will be enhanced by our accelerated fiber expansion in 5G spectrum deployment, a great reputation for advanced and reliable networking and our expertise to bring it all together for the customer. We remain laser-focused on reducing debt, and we'll strengthen our balance sheet by using proceeds from the WarnerMedia transaction to achieve a 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. We also expect to remain a top dividend-paying company after deal close, with a dividend payout in the $8 billion to $9 billion range where anywhere in that range should rank us among the best dividend yields in corporate America. We're now in the middle innings of our transformation, and the momentum we have is real and sustainable. We're well positioned post deal close to have a capital structure and balance sheet that puts us in an attractive position relative to our peers. In addition, we believe it provides us with the financial flexibility to invest significantly in our business and the flexibility to pursue additional shareholder value creation initiatives over time. We look forward to giving you more detail at our virtual analyst event, which we expect to host in March. And now, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Slide 6 should look familiar. As our pre-release earlier this month already indicated, we continue to deliver growth in postpaid phones, fiber and HBO Max. John just highlighted our full year results. We're really pleased with them and expect the momentum we've built in 2021 to carry over to 2022. Let's now take a look at our financial summary on Slide 7, starting with revenues. On a comparable basis, excluding DIRECTV and Vrio from both periods, consolidated revenues were up more than 4% for the quarter and about 6% for the year, thanks to growth in our market focus areas. Adjusted EBITDA was down 8% for the quarter on a comparable basis. Growth in Mobility was more than offset by a decline at WarnerMedia from the increased HBO Max investment, the new DIRECTV advertising channel arrangements and lower contribution from basic networks. Our consolidated operating income results continue to be impacted by certain retained costs from DIRECTV that are in the process of being rationalized. Apart from WarnerMedia's contributions, our Communications segment EBITDA was up approximately 2% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.78. In addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plan. For the year, EPS was up nearly 7% with strong organic growth in Mobility, lower interest, lower benefit costs and higher investment gains. We exceeded our free cash flow guidance for the year. For the quarter, cash from operations was $11.3 billion, spending increase year-over-year with CapEx of $3.8 billion and gross capital investments totaling $4.9 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in CapEx. For the full year, free cash flow was $26.8 billion despite an increase in CapEx of about $900 million and more than $4 billion in higher cash content costs. Our total dividend payout ratio was about 56%. This included cash distributions from DIRECTV of $1.9 billion. Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 8. For the second consecutive quarter, our Communications segment grew both revenues and EBITDA. A big part of that growth was driven by our increasing strength in Mobility, which turned in another solid quarter. Service revenues were up 4.6% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year driven by postpaid and prepaid subscriber gains. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at low levels and in fact, hit a record low for the full year. Our strong subscriber momentum continues with industry-leading postpaid phone growth. Prepaid also continues to deliver impressive results with phone churn less than 3% and revenues up mid-single digits. Cricket momentum continues with strong ad and phone churn substantially lower than 3%. Mobility EBITDA was up more than $300 million driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. This growth comes without a material return to international roaming and with 3G shutdown costs of about $130 million during the quarter. We remain on track to successfully shut down our 3G network next month and expect 3G shutdown impacts to peak in the first quarter of 2022 at about $250 million. In addition, we expect another $100 million of expense in the first quarter associated with investment in our FirstNet operations and the completion of support funding for the CAF II program. Business Wireline EBITDA margins continue to be stable as we rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. In fact, margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year, thanks to our transformation process. This rationalization process will continue in 2022. And as we lap the beginning of this process, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline in the latter part of 2022. We believe we're really well positioned in the enterprise space. And there is an interesting dynamic as public and private networking spots evolve. We have the account management infrastructure, the consulting expertise and the capabilities to support those businesses through that evolution as converged wireline and wireless solutions become the norm. At the same time, we're energized by the opportunities that our fiber expansion creates in the small to midsized business segment, and we plan to be more active there going forward. Turning to Consumer Wireline. Our fiber customer growth and fiber network expansion continues. And we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. We added 271,000 fiber customers even in a traditionally slow fourth quarter, and our fiber network continues to get even better with our new multi-gig speeds for AT&T fiber. Driven by our strength in fiber, total Consumer Wireline revenues were up for the third consecutive quarter. We had sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. Segment EBITDA did decline year-over-year due to a one-time pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter and higher network costs, including [storms] in the quarter. Let's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia revenues were up 15.4%, led by strong content licensing and DTC growth. DTC subscription revenues grew 11%, reflecting continued success of HBO Max, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues related to the termination of our arrangement with Amazon at the end of the third quarter. Content and other revenues were up 45%, reflecting higher TV licensing and theatrical releases. Advertising revenues were down about 13% primarily due to lower audiences with tough comparison to the political environment in last year's fourth quarter. Costs were up year-over-year due to a significant increase in programming and marketing, including the international launch costs for HBO Max. Incremental HBO Max investments for the quarter was approximately $500 million. The fourth quarter also included the impact of about $380 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing cost. We also launched some incredible content in the fourth quarter, including the premiere of the hit series And Just Like That and the third season of Succession. With the production team operating close to full throttle, we expect peak content investment in 2022 with an even stronger release schedule, including The Batman, Winning Time : The Rise of Lakers Dynasty and the highly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon. Now let's look at our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. What we're showing you today is a full year view of our consolidated revenue outlook excluding DIRECTV and Vrio from both periods. Our outlook does include a full year of expected results for WarnerMedia and Xandr. We also included our full year expectation for WarnerMedia's stand-alone contribution to help you model post close. We now expect the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction to close in the second quarter. Given this, we plan to update guidance for RemainCo at our upcoming virtual analyst event in March. Until then, let me walk you through our expectations for the year. First, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low single-digit range with wireless service revenue growth of about 3% plus for the full year. Mobility EBITDA is expected to grow low single digits plus over the course of the year as we continue to take disciplined share of subscribers with attractive long-term value. As noted earlier, several one-time related impacts such as peaking 3G network shutdown costs are expected to impact year-over-year EBITDA trends in the first quarter. Consumer Wireline revenues and EBITDA are expected to grow on improving fiber subscriber trends. However, we expect front-end loaded investments to impact first quarter year-over-year EBITDA trends as we ramp up promotional efforts around our new multi-gig offering. As noted earlier, we expect year-over-year comparison pressures to ease in our Business Wireline segment through the course of the year. However, we expect product rationalization to peak in the first quarter, resulting in more pronounced margin pressures in the first part of the year before recovering in the back half of the year. Consolidated adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $3.10 to $3.15 range. This guidance reflects WarnerMedia's declining contributions due to anticipated investment initiatives, a 200 basis point increase in our effective tax rate and no anticipated investment gains. We also expect adjusted equity income contributions from DIRECTV to be about $3 billion for the year. Look for more details on our earnings outlook during our upcoming virtual analyst event. Gross capital investment is expected to be in the $24 billion range and capital expenditures in the $20 billion range. Free cash flow is expected to be in the $23 billion range. That includes expected DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately $4 billion and $2 billion in higher expected cash taxes in 2022, reflecting the expiration of the immediate expensing of R&D and lower limitations on interest expense deductions starting this year. We expect WarnerMedia's full year contributions when including Xandr to be : revenues in the $37 billion to $39 billion range, EBITDA in the $6 billion to $7 billion range and free cash flow contribution of approximately $3 billion as we expect 2022 to be the peak investment year for HBO Max. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. John, good to hear the updated timing on the deal close. Can you perhaps update us on your conversations with the regulators, and what gives you the confidence to move that up? And when do you expect to give us the clarity on how the deal will be structured, what the dividend policy will be? Is that going to be in the March meeting? And then if you could just give us color on what we should be expecting with the CapEx this year. What's the 5G build-out this year? What's the fiber build-out this year? Any color there would be great. John Stankey : Simon, how are you doing? So first of all, where we are when we set the transaction up and announced it, I think I indicated it was really important for us to put a transaction out there that we felt like we had a high degree of confidence that we could work through the regulatory process. And I'm really pleased the team has done exactly that. And if you kind of looked at the prototype of the time frame and when we expected various approvals and processes to work through, we have tracked right to the likely case analysis on that. And as you are aware, we've had several milestones over the last couple of weeks, including clearance in the EU. We've gotten through our filing process with the SEC. You kind of look at where we are in other international regulatory domains and what our exchange has been with domestic regulators, and all that is going right to pattern as we expected. And we don't see anything that causes us concern and consequently raising our confidence level that we can tighten that time frame of when we believe we'll have everything kind of line up and be ready to go sometime during the second quarter. So I'm really pleased about that. I think everybody feels pretty good about where things stand. There's still work to be done, always is. There's a lot of moving parts. But based on how these things go, I feel about as good as I can feel at this point in that time. And we're now moving into the mode of the cycle where we're making what I'll call the final preparations as opposed to anticipating what we have to work through. In terms of clarity on structure, I would tell you, we're pretty close to giving you some guidance on that. I would certainly expect by the time we get together with you in March that you would have some understanding of where we're going, at least that's what I would expect. Ultimately, the Board has to make a call on that and has to make a final decision. Looking at it, handicapping it and my sense of where they are in that cycle and what we know about how the markets have performed over the last couple of months, I think we're at a point right now where we're almost ready to call a question on that. Our desire and our posture on that is we'd like to let you know as soon as we conclude. So once the Board makes a final decision, we will carry it forward. And I think we're tight enough to the close window right now that we could probably do that as soon as the Board is comfortable with the decision and what we want to do around that. They've, as you would expect, put a lot of diligence into this over the last several months. They've carefully considered a lot of different options. There are pros and cons to going either with a spin or a split. Certainly, it's attractive and we're -- the reason we kept this option open is at some point, I'd like to get the share count circulated on AT&T down. And this was an opportunity for us to evaluate whether something like that could occur in order to do that. It's a bit of an unprecedented transaction in size. There's never been a split off of anything close to this number of shares with this kind of a base. We also have a very large retail base, and we have to be mindful of the fact that, that retail base sometimes doesn't go as deep on the puts and takes and ins and outs of things as the institutional base does. And we need to make sure it's transparent and clean for everybody involved in this. And as I step back and look at it, we need to be very thoughtful about what we started with is our watch word around this transaction, which was we want the shareholders to get value out of this. This is all about driving shareholder value. And given the size of the split, we know that there would have to be some leakage to kind of get that structure properly. So as we kind of step back, we want to do something that's clean. We want to do something that's delivered. The Board hasn't decided right now. There's pros and cons of both. But I think we'll be probably giving you some sense of what we want to do around that in fairly short order. And we wanted to be transparent and claim. Here's what I would tell you is kind of where I start this. Markets are pretty good. They'll eventually settle to the right place. And as I said when we announced the transaction in May, this isn't going to be something that's going to ultimately manifest and unlock the value overnight. We knew that this restructuring would take a little bit of time, both through a regulatory process and then the reordering and combination of the new assets. And so being mindful of keeping true to the best way to get value back to the shareholder and being patient as the markets wear out over time, I think that's kind of where my head is at, at this juncture right now. And we'll finish the final touches on this and ultimately let you know fairly quickly. At the same time we do that, we'll let you know about the dividend policy and where we're going on that. We've already told you it's going to be between $8 billion and $9 billion. And I think we know enough about the market where it stands right now that no matter where we are in that $8 billion to $9 billion range, even at the low end of that range, we're still going to be paying out at the top of corporate America from a yield perspective. So it makes for a very attractive value in the stock right now. There's a lot of optionality and upside, especially when I think about how the media asset is performing and what's going on in the growth of the direct-to-consumer business and what we have for value accretion that can occur as we start to move up the kind of multiples that are warranted in that business. So I think that there's a good play either way around that. On the CapEx side, Simon, we're not going to break out specifically what we're doing in specific categories of the spend. What we've tried to give you a sense of is first of all, we've given you the guidance for the year. We told you in terms of how we're staging this. Our spend starts to get more aggressive in the wireless transition into the C-band in the Auction 110 Spectrum when we hit midyear. And the reason behind that is we are in a unique position to be able to deploy both 40 megahertz of our A block from the C-band and our 40 megahertz from the Auction 110. I want to be careful about how far I go, but it\u2019s public and in the public domain that we've won 40 megahertz nationwide in that auction. Those radios become available in the early part of the summer, late spring. And so to do that together at one time with one tower climb, that allows us to start really going what I would call good guns on this in scaling that up. And we'll be at 200 million POPs for mid-band deployment, which will be an 80 megahertz mid-band deployment by the end of next year. And so that's how you can think about the scaling and how we're going to deploy around that. And I think typically, when we've looked at an air interface change, it's been an $8 billion-ish round number to kind of get through that transition over a number of years. And I expect that, that will probably be the case as we work through the next three-year deployment of this air interface change. Simon Flannery : Okay. And on the fiber side? John Stankey : Look, we've given you the direction of where we're heading. They're going to be at 30 million homes by the end of '25. You saw us pick up the pace in the fourth quarter. We wound up 2.6 million passed locations. We feel like we're through the supply-related issues. The organization is executing in the field operationally at a very good clip on that. And so I feel very, very comfortable that we're going to hit that 30 million direction that we've given you by the end of '25. As I told you last quarter, I'd like to get off of the number of homes passed in any 90-day period discussion. And I think what you should be looking at is, are we selling more end users? And you are going to see us start to sell more end users each quarter as we move forward, and you're going to see our subscriber count start to ramp as that footprint gets larger. And I couldn't be more excited, given our announcement this week on 2-gig and 5-gig offerings. We are going to be out in the market with a superior product. We've had great momentum finishing another year of 1 million-plus adds. Now with a product that's going to be even better, it's going to clearly demonstrate the superior capabilities and the infrastructure we're putting out there, plus the footprint expansion, I feel really good about the moment you're going to be seeing in our subscriber counts as we move through '22. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Your simplified mobile offers have obviously had a lot of traction in the market. At the same time, they've been out there for about 1.5 years. And so it seems like consumers who are uniquely attracted to that have had a lot of opportunity to avail themselves. And so the question would be, how are you thinking about evolving your mobile go-to-market strategy or your value proposition? Or maybe another way of asking that would be, what do you think the AT&T brand means to the mobile consumer? What do you think it should mean? And what is your tactic for driving that perception shift? John Stankey : It's a good question, Brett. As we move through this year, I think you'll see us very definitively rotate into a position. First of all, I would tell you the strength of the period of time is, in fact, that we've been on these offers for a period of time. And I don't view that as being something I'm concerned about. I actually view it as something that we're really pleased about. It's basic, fundamental, easy for the customer to understand that we see no evidence whatsoever that we're losing traction in the value proposition that we have. And in fact, I would point to what we did this week on our broadband offer and trying to go in with an everyday simple pricing construct. And the reason we're doing that is based on what we learned from our wireless business, which is something that's very straightforward for the consumer to understand over time allows us to gain the right kind of momentum in the market that's sustainable. It drives up customer satisfaction. It allows us to be consistent in our messaging that we carry out to the market. It ensures that every one of our employees knows the line and doesn't have to relearn something every 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. And so we're very comfortable with the messaging we have right now. We're very comfortable that it still has room to run. And when we talk about a focused, simplified business moving forward, part of what we're attempting to do is move our entire product portfolio into a position that we can represent it in a similar fashion. And so this week's move in our fixed broadband products is really important when you think about lining that up and carrying that message forward. When I think about how we communicate more effectively around the brand, I think you've heard me allude to this in some previous conversations that there's a lot of things that I think the AT&T brand is very strong and does very, very well in the market : reliability, reputation of consistency, there's a perception within the business community about advanced networking and the strength that we have around that, trusted in those regards. But I also believe we can do some things to start to manifest to the consumer some of those characteristics we just talked about in a more real way, which is a more straightforward, simplified, credible, reliable expert. And I don't want to take away anybody's thunder, but I think you should expect after we close the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction that you will see us maybe start to refine a little bit of the messaging around the brand moving forward in the market that will carry forward the kind of characteristics in a little bit more pointed fashion that we want to carry forward. I think that is underneath your question. And we've been doing a lot of work around this. I've alluded to it in previous remarks. This isn't an advertising campaign. This is about structurally what we do behind the business to operate in a way that we think is going to be relevant with the consumer and get the operations lined up around that. So that what we tell the customer is, in fact, represented in our product offers, our service support, how they experience AT&T moving forward. We've been working really hard on that over the last year. We still have a little bit of work to do to finish that up. But I think by the time you get into the mid part of the year, you will see what that definition looks like and where we're going. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : First, Pascal, thanks for the -- all that color on the guidance and per segment. But can you give us -- can you let us know what the guidance for '22 assumes for RemainCo EBITDA growth? And then drilling down a little bit further, obviously, you guys cut the losses on the business side. And it sounds like you expect sort of further improvement maybe in the second half of next year. Could you walk us through sort of what's going on in that business segment to sort of rationalize it? And do you foresee the possibility of that segment returning to EBITDA growth by the end of the year? And then maybe for John, just maybe following up on those comments. When do you expect to have these converged offers in the market? And is that what you're talking about in terms of refining the message around the brand, selling a package of fixed and mobile services? John Stankey : So let me do the front end of this, John, and then I'll have Pascal just kind of walk you through the EBITDA dynamics. So let me step back. We're going to spend a lot of time on this in March when we're together with you to give you some color on the business market and where we're going. But here's what I would tell you, you should understand we've been executing on over the course of the last year and the process we're in. One, we've backed away from sales of revenues that are low margin, low strategic value products. And we've kind of been culling that out of the business profile. And some of that culling has been manifested in the results that you've seen over the course of the last year. And where I want the organization to move to is a much more crisp and intense focus on what I call owned and operated infrastructure. I want the foundation of what we're doing in the business segment to really start from we're always putting the customer on facilities and infrastructure that we own and operate, whether it be a wireless network or a fixed network. And we've made really good progress in our distribution in emphasizing wireless distribution into those segments. And we're now coming in behind that with some of our fixed capabilities as well. And that partly is making sure we have the right fiber products available as well as getting the footprint engineered correctly. So as we're out there deploying, are we doing the right things to pick up the business segments where we can grow in the small and midsized segment? We've been sharpening our engineering in order for us to do that. And so at the macro level, that's kind of the reorientation that's going on. And it doesn't mean we're backing away from the top end of the market. We want to still be that consulting expert for large enterprises and complex networking for those that need it. And those that need it are typically broad distributed companies, not ones that operate 2 data centers based on how SD-WAN is developed, et cetera. But it's those that have a lot of branch offices or many stores to support or restaurants to support. That distributed networking is kind of our strength and what we do and where we'll focus. But we can be a lot stronger in the mid and low end of the market. And tuning our distribution where we had that strength so that we can be in with both wireless and fixed solutions is really the reorientation that we're working in that segment of the market and where we need to -- where we're making that pivot to ultimately get back to the kind of growth that we need. I don't expect in aggregate that we're going to see EBITDA growth in the business segment this year. I do expect we're going to see that turn next year. And we're going to talk a little bit about that in March when we get together. But that's kind of what I would say is the macro point of view of what's occurring. And the converged offers in some cases are actually happening today, especially in the mid and upper part of the market is we bundle both wireless and fixed together on the same paper. And I think you're going to now start to see things that are occurring in private networking that extend into the business space. We already are starting. I can't disclose a couple of the larger customers we've signed with yet at this point, but you're starting to see that combined fixed wireless converged networking that I think is going to be relevant in the upper part of the business space. And then I believe you will see as we get into the latter part of the year us starting to do a better job of using both our fixed wireless capability to pick up segments of the business community early to accelerate revenues and then back in behind it with fixed facilities as we gain scale over time. But that should be something that really becomes more transparent to the customer where they're buying bandwidth from us and they're not caring about how we deliver. Pascal, do you want to give the EBITDA guide? Pascal Desroches : Sure thing. Look, as you know, John, we did not give specific EBITDA guidance, but I think you can get pretty close with some of the information that we've given. Here are some of the dynamics to think about in each of our major businesses for RemainCo. Mobility, while we expect some comparison issues early in the year, we feel really good about the organic trends in that business. We expect continued growth in wireless service revenues. We -- transformation continues, and we expect some operating leverage from that. So we feel really good about the trajectory that the Mobility business is on. I think you can get a pretty good sense for where that should land given our wireless service revenue growth, given our fourth quarter performance, we feel really good. Consumer Wireline, the word here is scale. As this -- we feel really good about the build we had in 2021. As that business scales, the operating leverage is really good. You couple that with transformation, the Consumer Wireline segment is also expected to grow. As you just heard from John, Business Wireline, we expect losses to moderate as we make our way through the year, but we don't expect that segment to grow. You layer on top of that an expectation of continued transformation savings on corporate and other. You can get a pretty fair sense that overall, the business is going to be, on an EBITDA basis, flattish to up modestly. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : I'm curious if you could dive a little further into the wireless business? And specifically, if you growth guidance of 3% plus with respect to how you're thinking about volume, the opportunities to improve ARPU and any contributions that you would expect from a DISH wholesale deal that you previously announced? And then just separately on a higher level in terms of the asset mix, John, you mentioned that you were largely done with asset disposition. And just curious if there's any further exploration of optimizing the wireline footprint or thinking about the future opportunities for your DTV business and where that may better fit strategically over time? Pascal Desroches : Mike, I -- let me start. Here's the way you think about it. First and foremost, the market remains really healthy. Now for planning purposes, as you would expect, we are planning that the industry will continue to grow the way it has the last 1.5 years. But overall, the market remains healthy. And in that environment, we're going to be disciplined, and we believe we will continue to take share in a very disciplined way. But for planning purposes, we have assumed that the overall industry normalizes to where it's been historically. That's one. In terms of ARPU, and I think we've said this previously, the way we think about this is as we make our way through the year, we would -- we have every expectation that we should see continuing recovery in international roaming. And also, what we're also seeing is our elite unlimited plan is our highest-priced ARPU plan, and it's our fastest growing. And as a result of that, we expect to continue moving up the ARPU stack. That's going to be partially offset by the amortization of some of the promotional expenses. But all in all, we feel really good about the trajectory of Mobility. John Stankey : So Michael, on your second question, so we set up the DIRECTV structure deliberately. And when I say we're through the asset disposition, I think the distinction I would draw there is the management team that -- of AT&T RemainCo is not going to be distracted with having to work through additional work on restructuring the asset base of the company in the near term. And that doesn't mean that the independent DIRECTV company and the management team that is operating that over there might not choose to do something in their business. I don't know of anything. I'm not announcing anything. But what I'm trying to distinguish is if that entity decided that there was value to be created to restructure their business in some way, shape or form, it is a distinctive group of individuals that would be involved in doing that and executing it. And it would not cause the AT&T management team to have to spend cycles and energy working through those kinds of issues. And so I think that's the distinction I'm trying to draw, not to suggest that the DIRECTV asset per se is frozen in time or not. In terms of your question on the wireline footprint, we spend a lot of time far back as 2012 and constantly revisiting and relooking how we wanted to work through the transition of our business. And I'm not a big believer right now that us going out and taking the less utilized parts of our wireline footprint and sending them out to somebody at a steep discount and continuing to have to do things like operationally provide services to that entity for many, many years to come on infrastructure, IT systems, et cetera, that have to be maintained is the right thing for a healthy and sustainable business. My point of view is that as a management team that runs networks and what we do around here, our job should be to rationalize those assets in an effective way and do it in the best interest of our shareholders. And you've heard me talk about that. When I talk about transformation and shutting down products and thinking about how we become a company that offers products on fiber, what's going on behind the scenes on that is actually backing away and moving deliberately through a process of taking products that served us incredibly well, that have been the mainstay of this company for a period of time and doing in a very, very smart and tactical way this shutdown and sunset of those. And as we sunset them, take the high cost operating model that supports them away. And so when we talk about transformation and we talk about getting savings from shutting down applications and IT infrastructure and product sunset, that's really walking away from square miles and infrastructure and costs and all the things that have seen their better day. And so we intend to ultimately capture that value and return it to the shareholder, not do it in a front-end loaded transaction that's highly discounted, that leaves us saddled with distracting operating models that don't allow us to be a focused broadband fiber provider offering the best products available in the market. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess my first one for you, John, we saw about 2.5x more fiber homes passed in 2020. But over the course of the year, fiber net adds didn't really accelerate. And so as we look at even more acceleration in fiber, when should we start to see the acceleration in fiber net adds? And what's the typical lag time from a passing to a selling opportunity? And Pascal, I guess I was a little surprised to see the $4 billion growth capital investment premium over CapEx because I think over most of the year, we've been talking about maybe weaning ourselves off of that number. And I think that it raises the question as we look into 2023 and people have been, as you know, trying to bridge from this year's 26 to the 2023 $20 billion guidance given the higher CapEx and the loss of the $3 billion WarnerMedia cash contribution, how much vendor financing is baked into that 20 that maybe we hadn't been thinking about? John Stankey : So I'll take the front end, Dave, and then you can get the color from Pascal on the EBITDA dynamic and cash flow. The answer to your question is, from the time we say go to about the time we're actually in the market selling is currently running about a year. And that's literally when we say go that we're going to start engineering and go into a particular area. I'd like that at maturity and the challenge I've got to the team is I like that to be 9 months. What's worked against us to do better than a year right now has been a little bit of spottiness in the supply chain that we've shared with you. It's really what drove some of the challenges to get to the 3 million objective last year that we ultimately ended up at 2.6. And as a result of that, we were back-end loaded in the churn-up of the 2.6. That inventory came available for sale very late in the year. And now it's out in the market and available. And as we shared with you, what we have improved fairly dramatically over the last several years is a rate of penetration once it becomes available for sale. And we're walking up that penetration dynamic faster. And so my goal had been and what I'd still like to work the management team to is from time of engineering to time of availability 9 months and then achieving what we're actually doing right now on the penetration rates. And so you are going to see that acceleration start to happen because we have put that inventory in the market. A lot of it came on late last year. And you should expect that as we start working through the quarter here and into second quarter, third quarter that we start dynamic of putting 3 handles routinely on our net add numbers for broadband. And that's where I want to see us get, and we should be able to get there as we move through this year. So that's kind of the color on it. But what we've been characterizing for you on our rate of penetration, teams made a lot of progress on that. And that's a huge economic driver of return given the pace and the rate we're doing right now. But I wouldn't mind if at steady state, we got 3 more months of the build cycle. Supply chain has kind of been working against us right now and making that happen and maybe that clear sometime this year, we'll have to see. David Barden : Got it. Pascal Desroches : Dave, on your free cash flow question, you'll hear more from us at Investor Day, but here's what -- just to reiterate some of the piece parts. For 2022, we are guiding to $23 billion of -- the $23 billion range of free cash flow. WarnerMedia is contributing, call it, around $3 billion. And we expect vendor financing to continue to be around $4 billion for this year. You are correct in your recollection that look, we were going to look really hard to make sure that as we are doing these vendor financing transactions that we are getting the best possible terms and to the extent we felt we can get better financing sources otherwise, we would do that instead of taking vendor financing. But we have found that more and more of our vendors are willing to provide us at very attractive terms. And we're taking advantage of those. With all that said, the guidance we've given here anticipates $20 billion of overall gross capital investment. Other piece parts are keep in mind, as we close the WarnerMedia transaction, we should see a meaningful savings in interest expense and cash interest.  And then as we make our way through the year and next year, we're going to hold ourselves accountable to continuing to grow EBITDA at RemainCo. So those are all the piece parts to think about as you think about our $20 billion guidance for this year, and you'll hear more from us at Analyst Day. David Barden : And Pascal, if I could just -- a quick follow-up on that. So if -- what you're saying is that in March of 2021, when you were contemplating not using as much vendor financing and you set the $20 billion free cash flow guide for 2023, are you saying that now that vendor financing is too attractive not to take that whatever CapEx number was in that $20 billion free cash flow number will fall replaced by vendor financing and that $20 billion free cash flow guide is actually going to be higher? Pascal Desroches : As I said, Dave, you will hear from us. Today, we are giving guidance on 2022. You'll hear from us on 2023 at our Analyst Day in March. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : It's funny. I know you're not going to own this forever, but the -- a lot of moving pieces in the Warner side. Can you talk through what's going on in HBO and how we should think about this going forward? Obviously, a lot of issues with Amazon sort of volatility through the quarter. But should we think of this HBO ARPU run rate as a good level going forward? Or is there still expected to be volatility there? And how do you think about the potential growth rate domestically for HBO from here now that the ad-driven product is launched? You also said peak content investment in 2022. Should we expect this to be a sort of negative EBITDA all year? Or do you think by the back half, we've got enough growth to get that back to positive? John Stankey : Sure, Phil. Let me give you maybe some color on the front end and then we can go through. So first of all, as you know, there's a lot of moving parts on the ARPU side of things. One moving part is international ARPUs are different than domestic ARPUs. And if you think about the growth internationally where that's going to be a large part of the growth moving forward, given the new markets we're opening up and the natural penetration that occurs, given the product is sized differently and starts from a different place, you're going to see that have an impact. Generally speaking, those ARPUs internationally are a bit lower than the domestic ARPUs. Second point, we've had launched, as I said earlier in my comments, the ad-supported product. And I expect the ad-supported product as a percentage of mix domestically in the U.S. to increase this year. Part of that will be because the products had a little bit of a different characteristic where the subscription product had access to first-run movies. The ad-supported product did not. Effective January 1, products are identical now. And as a result of that, I expect there'll be some customers that choose to go the ad-supported route that may have gone the subscription route before. However, what will happen is it's not that one is less accretive than the other. The subscription line will possibly dilute a bit, but the advertising line will increase. So when you look at the customer overall, they're no less profitable. It just books to 2 different places on the P&L. And our goal, and in fact, what we are seeing today, we are indifferent as to what the customer chooses. Frankly, maybe in some cases, it's a bit more accretive if they go the ad-supported route. So I think you just need to look at your geography of how that plays out more than anything else relative to the domestic side. Look, we expect domestic growth to be more suppressed than international growth as we move forward. We're in a great position. We are sitting at a large domestic base with a very high ARPU. And the nice part about that is, we said this was going to happen, and it happened. We said the market was going to come to us on pricing. And lo and behold, we are no longer the high-priced offer in the market. And the nice part about that is we think it will allow us to have domestic growth as we move forward. But the base is in a really, really good place as a result of that. We don't have the struggles that maybe some other products that came in at very low prices are going to have to kind of try to move up that ARPU continuum. It's about being very diligent in adding customers at a moderated pace. And I think if you go back to our Analyst Day in 2019, whenever we did that, and we gave you our domestic point of view of what that growth is going to look like, it was a very measured and moderated point of view because starting with mid-40 million-ish customers allowed us to be very different given the ARPUs that we had around them. And then finally, we made that hard decision on Amazon to your point. We felt it was the right decision. I feel it was the right decision. I think it will even be more the right decision in a post discovery environment as the offer only gets stronger that's in the market and the content that's available. At the end of the day, you want full control of your customers. And I'm confident with the strength of the offer that will be in the market, those customers are all going to come back into the offer. It may take a couple of quarters for that to happen. But there will eventually be a product out there that they're going to look at and say they want to be part of. And better to have them there where you have direct access control of them, can market to them, know what they're doing than to have it be in some black box where you absolutely have no idea what somebody else is doing with aggregating your content and your exposure to the customer. And I would point that out again. That is what our customer base is. There are a lot of entities out there growing \"direct-to-consumer customers\" that are behind the screen of the Amazon marketplace that really are Amazon's direct-to-consumer customers. They are not the media company's direct-to-consumer customers. Pascal, did you want to add anything on the EBITDA side? Pascal Desroches : Look, we provided you with guidance for WarnerMedia, what the contributions for the full year. And keep in mind, we are launching in a number of European territories as well as we plan to launch CNN+ this year. So we are going to be in the investment cycle. But overall, we feel really good about the underlying trends of our direct-to-consumer business. And the balance of the business is performing exactly as you would anticipate. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Phil. Operator? And we have time for one last question. Operator : And that last question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : So Pascal, maybe one on free cash flow and a bit on the tender. But probably on the free cash flow side, if you think about the $20 billion kind of a number for this year, could you help us understand the breakdown? I mean, there's been some pushback, billion number may not be a real number clearly on the back of the telecom business. So if you could help us understand how much of the contribution comes from the DIRECTV, the Xandr bit as well as potential cash flow reversal because you might now get paid for HBO distribution instead of absorbing the working capital impact. So if you could just help us understand that, that would be useful. And then the other source of confusion, I think, has been the impact of vendor and the relationship across the 3 assets, across DIRECTV, AT&T as well as WarnerMedia. So if you could just understand the puts and takes. I mean, what went away with the Microsoft transaction, how much of cash flow comes in to AT&T and what moves out to DIRECTV, that would be useful to contextualize the cash flow number? Pascal Desroches : Okay. So Kannan, I appreciate the question. So here is, for 2020, let me try to break down free cash flow for you so that, overall, we are guiding to $23 billion. The contribution from WarnerMedia is about $3 billion. The remainder of the company, including the contributions from DIRECTV, are making up the balance of this. And those -- both will continue post separation. The piece part to think about this year relative to the past, we're going to have higher CapEx. And as John explained earlier, that CapEx is related to our payment of spectrum as well as our continuing and accelerated rollout of fiber. So we're going to have higher CapEx. But we do expect, as we make our way through the year, that our cash interest costs should decline because of the delevering that is happening at the company. And of course, we are growing our -- as I said, we're flat to up modestly on EBITDA for the overall RemainCo. Those are the big piece part. The way to think about Xandr separately, Xandr has the way to think about historically 2 pieces. You have the AppNexus business, which is in the midst of being sold to Microsoft. We have an agreement in place for that. And then you have the DIRECTV advertising inventory. The DIRECTV advertising inventory prior to the separation was managed and included within WarnerMedia's results. Upon separation, there was a new agreement struck that whereby WarnerMedia would continue to sell DIRECTV advertising inventory through the -- until close. And in exchange for that, WarnerMedia would not -- would receive an ad share. And so the vast majority of the economics of DIRECTV advertising inventory is going back to DIRECTV. Only a commission is staying with WarnerMedia. So that's -- those are the piece parts for Xandr and the free cash flow dynamics. Kannan Venkateshwar : Okay. And could I just ask one follow-up on HBO? On the Amazon deal, that probably caused some volatility in the quarter, but revenues were sequentially down even though subscribers were up and the ARPU was also quite weak sequentially. But when you think about the sequential impact -- sequential revenue trends from here on, is that decline a one-time kind of a decline? How should we think about the cadence from here on? Pascal Desroches : Yes. Kannan, yes, we expected that we were going to take a -- we're going to be decelerating as a result of Amazon. It is a one-time decline as we move forward and continue to grow subscribers, we would expect that growth from here. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Kannan. I'll turn it over to John for some final comments. John Stankey : So thank you very much for joining us today, and I just couldn't be more pleased with how 2021 turned out. As I started in my opening comments, we outlined for you what we intended to do through the course of the year, and I think we checked the box across the board on every commitment that we made to you. I'm really proud of the team. I'm proud of Jason. I'm proud of Jeff. I think they've done a remarkable job, given that we've got a number of moving parts going on in restructuring this business to get the kind of operational focus that we asked them to do. And I think 4 quarters of results here demonstrate that. And I'm really pleased that we're on the doorstep of being able to complete the transactions that we have in front of us and allow both management teams to focus on moving things forward in the way they can with a clean operating environment. I think the best days are ahead here as a result of that. Thanks very much. Hope you all have a good year. We'll see you in 90 days. Operator : And that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning to all of you. I appreciate you joining us this morning. Two weeks ago, we reached a major milestone in the repositioning of our business with the completion of the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction less than 11 months after announcing the deal. I'd like to thank everyone who played a role in getting this across the finish line in good time and with a little drama, just as we promised you. I'd also like to share how proud we are of the entire WarnerMedia team. David inherits an organization with one of the best global portfolios of beloved intellectual property, a team with unparalleled talent, and one of the few truly global direct-to-consumer players, as evidenced by the continued growth in HBO Max and HBO subscribers, which closed this quarter at nearly 77 million globally, up 3 million from last quarter and nearly 13 million year-over-year. We're excited about the potential for continued HBO Max growth as the service launches in more new territories. Warner Bros. Discovery is well-positioned to lead the transformation we're seeing unfold across the media and entertainment landscape. And like many of my fellow AT&T shareholders who own a stake in this new and promising enterprise, we're excited to continue to watch their success and the value they create as one of the leading global media companies. So, let me turn to AT&T and the new era and opportunities ahead of us. Our transaction marks a critical step in the repositioning of our business. We're now able to focus intensely on what we believe will be multiyear secular tailwinds in connectivity. We now have the right asset base and financial structure to devote our energy to becoming America's best broadband provider. Over a five-year period, we expect a five-fold data increase on our networks and we plan to capitalize on the growing desire from consumers and businesses for ubiquitous access to best-in-class connectivity solutions. The results we've achieved the past seven quarters, all while undergoing a significant repositioning of our business, give me confidence that we can accomplish this goal. Our first quarter financial results are consistent with our expectations and once again demonstrate that our teams are executing well against our consistent business priorities. We're seeing record levels of net additions in Mobility and consistently strong AT&T Fiber growth, thanks to our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy. In Mobility, our strong network performance, simplified offers and improving customer experience brought in the most first quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, surpassing last year's then decade best first quarter total. And we're confident we can continue this momentum in a disciplined manner, given our subscriber success has come from diversified channels that span consumers and businesses. In Fiber, we continue our great build velocity and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations. This expansion continues to allow our business to grow. And this quarter, we achieved overall broadband subscriber and revenue growth as our Fiber net adds more than offset legacy non-fiber broadband losses. I'm pleased with the improved fiber momentum we're seeing with our multi-gig plans launched early in the first quarter. It's also noteworthy that we're experiencing improved subscriber growth following the introduction of our straightforward pricing across the fiber portfolio, which does away with discounted introductory pricing. This improvement in share gains suggest that consumers are finding value and higher quality services when they're made available to them. So taking a step back, let's review our progress over the last seven quarters. During that time, we've added industry best subscriber totals of more than 5.3 million in postpaid phones and nearly 2 million in AT&T Fiber, as our fast-growing fiber revenues now make up nearly half of our Consumer Wireline broadband revenues. This is real and sustainable momentum. We also continue to emphasize effectiveness and efficiency across our operations. As we shared at our Analyst Day last month, we expect to achieve more than $4 billion of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. Our focus on driving efficiencies continues to show tangible results from our network build-out to customer experience. As we told you, we're initially reinvesting these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses. However, as we move to the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to fall to the bottom line. Our success over the past seven quarters can also be attributed to our focus on better recognizing and delivering on what customers want. Our Mobility and Fiber Net Promoter Scores are up year-over-year and near historically low churn levels across all businesses demonstrate how our improvements to the customer experience are real and delivering a positive impact. Our Business Wireline unit continues its transformation. As we move through this year, we had planned to accelerate the pace at which we reposition the business, as we focus our energy on growing repeatable core connectivity and transport solutions where we have onerous economics. At the same time, we'll continue to rationalize reselling low-margin, third-party products and services. The expansion of our fiber footprint is enabling our business portfolio to target significant opportunities in the small and medium business market, allowing us to capture a greater portion of the opportunities in core transport and connectivity. In addition, as we open up relationships with more customers, we'll have incremental opportunities to continue our growth in business wireless. We expect to take advantage of these near-term opportunities to help stabilize our Business Wireline unit, as we simplify the portfolio and grow connectivity with small- to medium-sized businesses complementing our leading enterprise position. As we thoughtfully fuel growth for service is powered by our owned and operated connectivity assets, we're also being deliberate in how we allocate our capital. We've taken significant steps to improve our financial flexibility, and we're now in a much better place to grow our business, as we significantly invest in the future of connectivity through 5G and fiber. With the completion of the WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction, we've monetized more than $50 billion of assets since the beginning of 2021. And with this transaction, we reduced our net debt by approximately $40 billion in April. As we share, we feel as though we're really well suited to navigate this unique moment in time. This leaves us in a much better position to pay down debt. In fact, we've already addressed some of our near-term maturities and paid off over $10 billion in bank loans. This improved financial posture gives us the flexibility to carefully and prudently use the balance of the WarnerMedia proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt by opportunistically using the evolving higher rate environment to redeem debt securities at lower prices, while also working to reduce cash interest. In addition, our expectations for continued strong cash generation provide us with incremental capabilities to reduce leverage, while still paying an attractive dividend yield near the top of the Fortune 500. This improved financial flexibility also allows us to pursue durable and sustainable growth opportunities that offer future upside for customers and shareholders. If you couldn't tell, I'm proud of all the work the team has accomplished to reposition the business over the last seven quarters and could not be more excited about this next chapter for AT&T. I know our teams are thrilled about the momentum we're generating with our deliberate and focused approach in attracting and retaining customers. I'll now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our first quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 5. It's important to note that our first quarter consolidated results include the contributions of WarnerMedia and that last year's first quarter included results of our US Video business and Vrio. Accordingly, our reported results do not provide a clear reflection of our business on a forward-looking basis.  So let me quickly cover a few key points before reviewing the financial results of our new stand-alone AT&T operations on the next slide. On a consolidated basis, including a full quarter of WarnerMedia, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77 compared to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plans. Year-over-year earnings declines were primarily driven by WarnerMedia and to a lesser extent, certain onetime costs in the Communications segment. The declines in earnings at WarnerMedia reflect increased investments incurred in launching CNN+ and expanding new territories at HBO Max. HBO Max and HBO now reached an impressive global subscriber base of nearly 77 million. WarnerMedia's results were also impacted by the advertising sharing agreement entered into with DIRECTV upon its separation in last year's third quarter and the termination of HBO Max's wholesale agreement with Amazon late last year. When excluding revenues from our US Video business and Vrio from the prior year quarter, AT&T consolidated revenues were $38.1 billion, up 1.6% or $600 million year-over-year. Cash from operations came in at $5.7 billion for the quarter. Overall spending was up with capital investments totaling $6.3 billion. Free cash flow was $700 million for the quarter. WarnerMedia had declines of $2.6 billion in free cash flow year-over-year. This decline was driven by $1.2 billion in lower year-over-year securitization of receivables in advance of the transaction, $600 million in higher cash content spend, increased investments in HBO Max's global footprint and ramp-up for the CNN+ launch, as well as NHL right payments and other working capital changes. Now let's look at our financials for the new standalone AT&T on Slide 6. On a comparative like-for-like basis, our financial results for the quarter are in line with our expectations for how we expect the year to trend. However, our subscriber metrics came in better than we expected as market conditions remain strong. This gives us confidence in the annual guidance provided at our recent Analyst Day.  Revenues were $29.7 billion, up 2.5% or $700 million year-over-year, driven by wireless and broadband revenue growth, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline. Adjusted EBITDA was flattish year-over-year, as lower retained video costs were offset by peak impact from our 3G network shutdown, continued success-based investments in wireless and fiber and the launch of MultiGift fiber plans.  We remain confident that Q1 will be the trough in our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA trajectory. We continue to expect the year-over-year trendline to progressively improve through the year. On a comparative basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63 versus $0.58 in the first quarter of 2021 due to higher equity income from DIRECTV and lower interest expense. Cash from operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter. Overall spending was up year-over-year with standalone AT&T capital investments of $6.1 billion. Free cash flow was $2.9 billion. As expected, cash flow this quarter was affected by several factors. First, higher capital investments as we ramp fiber deployment and prepare to deploy our 5G mid-band spectrum bands in the back half of the year. Second, the absorption of 3G shutdown impact. Third, increased employee incentive compensation benefits paid in Q1. Fourth, lower proceeds from securitizations. DIRECTV cash distributions were $1.8 billion in the quarter, which is modestly better than the $1.5 billion contribution in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect about $4 billion distribution from DIRECTV for the year, so we do expect some moderation. Given that Q1 is a seasonally low quarter for free cash flow and many of the factors impacting free cash are not expected to repeat, we remain confident in the guidance we provided to you during our Analyst Day to achieve free cash flow in the $16 billion range for the year and on a standalone basis. Looking forward, we expect to incur restructuring charges over the next few quarters as we continue to execute our transformation initiatives. The cash impact of these charges has already been contemplated in our full year free cash flow guidance. Now, let's turn to our subscriber results for our market-focused areas on slide seven. Diving a bit deeper into our business unit level performance, the story continues to be simple and straightforward. The consistent, disciplined go-to-market strategy we implemented almost two years ago continues to work very well, and we're delivering strong momentum and growing customer relationships with 5G and fiber. In the quarter, we had 691,000 postpaid phone net adds. As John said, this marks our best first quarter in more than a decade. This total also excludes impacts of 3G network shutdown of more than 400,000 postpaid phones. Consistent with industry practice, we have treated this reduction as an adjustment of our base at the beginning of the period. Churn also remained near historically low levels, thanks in part to our improving NPS, which is being driven by an enhanced customer experience, the strength of our network, and our consistent and simple offers. We're growing our customer base with this disciplined approach. Our teams have maintained a strong focus on growing the right way with high-quality intake and by investing in existing customers. As mentioned in March, we're focused on incentivizing customers to shift to our current unlimited rate plans, which are designed for the 5G era and to better meet each customer's unique needs and provide greater value to both existing and new customers. Looking at AT&T Fiber, our customer base continues to grow as we expand availability of the best access technology across our footprint. We had 289,000 AT&T Fiber net adds in the first quarter and we expect to accelerate growth from here. To say we're excited about the underlying momentum of the business would be an understatement. Where we have Fiber, we win and gain share and our deployment plans remain on track. We now have 6.3 million AT&T Fiber customers, up 1.1 million compared to a year ago and we expect customer momentum to accelerate from these already stepped-up levels. We continue to see strong demand for AT&T Fiber as customers seek out faster broadband speeds at an attractive price. And our fiber churn remains low as AT&T fiber continues to offer a great experience and a consistently high Net Promoter Score. Now let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on slide 8. Our Mobility business continues its record level momentum. Revenues were up 5.5%, with service revenues growing 4.8% due to subscriber growth. Impressively, this growth in service revenue comes despite impact on service revenue of our 3G shutdown and without a material return of international roaming revenues. Consistent with our comments on Analyst Day, Mobility EBITDA declined 1.8% year-over-year, largely due to a number of one-time related factors. EBITDA was negatively impacted by over $300 million due to 3G shutdown costs and the absence of FirstNet and CAF II reimbursement. We remain confident in our stated expectations for Mobility adjusted EBITDA trajectory to improve through the course of the year as these impacts moderate through the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to see healthy Mobility demand. While our guidance does not factor in industry demand levels replicating the strength that we experienced in 2021, our Q1 results came in better than anticipated. Both our postpaid phone and prepaid phone churn remained near record low levels despite a modest uptick among lower income cohorts as certain pandemic levels benefits wear-off. Now let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on slide 9. Our fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. Even with expected declines from copper based broadband services, our total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 2% due to higher broadband ARPU and fiber revenue growth. Our fiber ARPU was approximately $60 with gross addition intake ARPU in the $65 to $70 range. We expect overall fiber ARPU to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs we introduced earlier this year. In addition, with the launch of our new multi-gig speeds in January, we have even more opportunity to move customers to higher speed tiers. Over time, we expect these factors to serve as a tailwind to the trajectory of our fiber ARPU. We also continue to accelerate our fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations. As you heard us share on Analyst Day, our plans center on pivoting from copper-based products to fiber. As we make this pivot, we expect positive EBITDA growth in 2022, driven by growth in broadband revenues. Also to help provide you with greater insight into the performance of our Consumer Wireline fiber operations, we've provided additional metrics in our trending materials that can be found on our IR website. Looking at Business Wireline, we continue to execute on our rationalization of low-margin products in our portfolio. In the first quarter, we experienced some impacts by the timing of government sector demand due to the delays in passing the federal budget, which caused deeper than expected revenue declines. However, we expect demand to rebound later this year. While the rationalization of our Business Wireline portfolio creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues, it also allows us to focus on our own and operated connectivity services as well as growing 5G and fiber integrated solutions. Both areas, business 5G and fiber, continue to perform well, benefiting our Mobility segment with Business Solutions wireless service revenue growth of 8.4% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base by about 300,000. We remain comfortable with our guidance of Business Wireline EBITDA down mid-single digits in 2022. Shifting to slide 10, I'd like to reiterate our overall capital allocation framework moving forward. With the completion of the WarnerMedia transaction, AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash and WarnerMedia's retention of certain existing debt. Additionally, AT&T shareholders received 1.7 billion shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, representing 71% of the new company. This transaction greatly strengthens our balance sheet and provides us with financial flexibility going forward. We now have a simplified capital allocation framework. First, we plan to invest in our strategic focus areas : 5G and Fiber. As previously said, we expect stand-alone AT&T capital investments of $24 billion in 2022 and 2023. Starting in 2024, we expect our capital investment to begin tapering to around the $20 billion range as we surpass peak levels of investments in 5G and transformation. The completion of the WarnerMedia transaction also marks a significant step towards achieving our established goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5 times range by the end of 2023. We've shared, as we get closer to this target, we expect our financial flexibility to improve. This increases our ability to pursue other ways to deliver incremental value for our shareholders. As previously said, we expect to deliver annual total dividends of around $8 billion, which represents $1.11 per common share. This remains an attractive dividend and places AT&T among the very best dividend-yielding stocks in the US. Now, let's take a step back and look at the free cash flow generation expected from our business. As outlined at our Analyst Day, we expect to generate in the range of $20 billion of free cash flow in 2023. After paying dividends and non-controlling interest commitments, we expect to have at least $10 billion of cash remaining. And beyond 2023, this pace of cash generation will be helped by the tapering down of our capital investment. This is why we continue to feel very comfortable with our capital allocation plans. As I've stated, we're in a much stronger financial position to pay down debt. And at the end of the first quarter, more than 90% of our debt portfolio was fixed and we do not have near-term needs to issue debt. In April, we improved our net debt by about $40 billion and paid down over $10 billion in bank loans, providing us with a lot more financial flexibility. We also provided notice that we plan to redeem an additional $12.5 billion of bonds by mid May, reducing our near-term maturities. For the balance of the WarnerMedia proceeds, we plan to reduce our outstanding debt by focusing on pay down of commercial paper to improve our liquidity and opportunistically, using the higher-rate environment to redeem debt at lower prices. So we feel really confident in our ability to pay down our current debt maturities in an effective manner and reach our goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions on margins, if you could. First, maybe on the consumer side, numbers were a little bit better than we thought. I mean if you look back to 2019, you guys were generating margins in the sort of 39%, 40% range. Given the change in the business and the mix there and the higher ARPUs, do you think you can eventually get back to those kind of levels? And then I guess on the other side of the ledger, consumer \u2013 or the business segment continues to be weaker than expected, thanks for the color there. But how much visibility do you have in the improvement in the margins and the declines there? Any other color on that sort of rationalization of the portfolio you guys keep talking about? And should we see this improvement even if we see some economic headwinds later in the year? John Stankey : Good morning, John. How are you? Consumer Wireline first, let's -- the thing to keep in mind is in repositioning this business, we had \u2013 over the last several years, we've been investing in our Fiber footprint and investing and launching in new parts of our footprint. What happens going forward is as the business add subscribers, we expect margins to continue to improve. And our cost base is relatively fixed once we've laid fiber out, so we do expect improvements overtime.  We haven't guided in terms of specific margins expected to generate, but we feel really good about the long-term view of this business. I mean you look at others in the space, margins are really attractive. Pascal Desroches : And John, I'd add to that, if you go in and you kind of decompose what's in the transformation program and where we're targeting improvements in our operations in our business and things like reduction of call center activity that ultimately moves online, et cetera, all those things feed directly into that business that will -- it will allow us to scale that into the right kind of margin structure that I think we've historically been accustomed to, given the long-live nature of the asset base that we're deploying. To answer your question on the business side, I'll tell you what we have visibility to, we share with you, our move is to be driving harder owned and operated infrastructure into the lower end of the mid part of the market. And in order to do that, that's highly correlated to where we're deploying new fiber or where we have existing infrastructure deployed. We have good visibility to that part of it. So, we know, as we deploy what we open up in terms of new market opportunity. In some cases, in order to get that market, we're shifting our distribution channels. So, there is work going on around how we ultimately position to distribute the product both directly through our own sales force, as well as through other third parties. That's an execution issue. While we have control over how we progress on that, obviously, any time you scale up new channels and you work through things, there's things that you run into they are unexpected or that allow you to move left to right that you have to adjust to. But that's nothing new, that's the kind of thing we work with. And I think in terms of working through those issues, they usually are cycles that matter from a quarter or two. They're not the kind of things that you hit a brick wall and can't work your way through. That's the area that I would say, maybe we don't have perfect visibility over, but it's a question of whether you trust we can execute? And I would tell you, my view is we know how to do these kinds of things. I think I shared with you in the Analyst Day one thing that is very clear as we walk into the segment with the AT&T brand on the product and service, it's incredibly well received. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, when we walk into these customers and we have the opportunity to talk to them about a new product, it oftentimes leads to a second discussion about possibly moving other parts of their services, like wireless, in that transaction. And that's the power of us in the business segment being able to go in with a complete portfolio of owned and operated wireless and direct fixed transport. John Hodulik : Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, John. Operator, if we could move to the next question. Operator : Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. As you look at the postpaid phone volume growth in the quarter, how much of that do you attribute to better market share versus just better overall industry growth? And can you frame how the economics of these mobile postpaid phone customers are evolving when you consider the ARPU, churn as well as the cost of acquisition? John Stankey : Mike, sure. Obviously, we don't -- we're first, so we don't have information as to how others are going to report this quarter. We, clearly, from the way we look at data, have some view of what's going on in the market. And I can tell you without backing that up with the actual reports from others, we believe the overall market still remains pretty strong. And we're seeing, what I would say, consistent volumes to what we saw in 2021 in terms of gross add pool that is occurring in the market. And I think we shared with you as we were guiding, we expected that to maybe taper down a little bit this year as we were giving you our estimates and our expectations. And so far, at least through the first quarter, we haven't seen that materialize at this juncture. And I would expect -- I don't know, but my guess is after everybody reports, I won't be surprised if trends are similar to what you've seen in previous quarters in terms of flow share overall for our business. I don't want to overdrive my headlights on that, I could be surprised by what somebody puts on the table. But from my market sensing and data, I didn't see a material shift in overall flow share this quarter versus previous quarters. And I feel really good about that, especially given the nature of some of the promotional activity that occurred during the fourth quarter of last year, that we chose not to chase, stayed very consistent in the first quarter of this year with our strategies and approach and others are throwing a lot of different things at it. I don't see us out there with BOGOs and I don't see us out there with $1,000 incentive to switch that others are using in the market. We've been very stable in our approach. And I think the thing that I would point to in terms of the overall economics is, look at ARPUs, they remain very, very stable, as we told you they were going to remain despite all the gains that are coming in here. And as we shared with you at Analyst Day, our cost per gross adds are getting better, not worse, because we're scaling that away now, where our fixed cost structure is obviously being spread across a larger number of subscribers on any given quarter. That's a good dynamic that's going on there. And our churn numbers continue to be very, very strong with our customer life cycle is actually looking better than what they historically looked. That means better value. So, as we've been sharing with you all along, we feel really comfortable that the economics of these customers that we're bringing in are no different right now than they were a quarter ago or two quarters ago or three quarters ago, and we'll take these customers all day long. Pascal Desroches : Mike, I would also just add, as a reminder, our fastest growing plan is our Unlimited Elite, which is our top-tier plan. So that tells you the quality of what's happening in the overall wireless base. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Michael. If we can move to the next question, operator. Operator : Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks. And it's actually sort of a two-part question on inflation. The first part is we saw one of your competitors earlier this week announced they were going to be increasing or have increased minimum wage for their retail workforce and a big part of their customer facing workforce. So I was hoping you can maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of labor cost and labor supply and whether or what you've anticipated in your outlook for this year for inflationary cost pressures on the workforce? And then second, John, I think you've made some comments recently that if you did see inflationary pressures persist, you might look at what your pricing was, and I think it was implied that you could take price up. I was hoping you could maybe just elaborate on how you think about your pricing model if we were to remain in the sustained inflationary environment? And what gives you confidence you can execute a degree of pricing leverage even as the market remains competitive? Thank you. John Stankey : Sure, Brett. How are you? So look, there is no question there's wage inflation in the environment. And frankly, it's 7% inflation. There is no question there's pressures across a broad segment of goods and services and we're not insulated from that. I don't think anybody in the industry is insulated from that, and it's not a good position for the overall economy to be in. And I think from a policy perspective, it needs to be addressed. We were pretty deliberate when we did planning for 2022, acknowledging that we expected we'd see some wage inflation. And we compared to previous years as we built the plan, we assumed upticks in wages as a result of that. And we did several revisions late in the planning cycle that I would say those amounts added something with the B [ph] into overall cost structure into our expectations around that. We're in the middle of -- as you know, we have labor contracts. Labor contracts are extended and ultimately program out wage increases. And we have the luxury in some cases, given the way the current wage market or job market is set up, that people stick around and work here because we have great benefits for middle class folks and they often go beyond the wage that somebody gets paid. And as a result of that, we've been managing through the dynamics of the wage, the labor market pretty well. I will tell you, we're in the middle of some negotiations right now. Those negotiations are likely to land in a place that I think is consistent with how we built the plan this year, which was a stepped-up wage level from previous historic levels. I'm not happy about the fact that wages are rising as fast as they are. We're having to deal with it. It is going to drive a bit of an uptick in what I would call per individual wages. The good news is we're doing a lot of investment in other forms of mechanization and automation in our business. And some of that investment is helping us keep a lid on some of the wage related inflation costs. I would also point out that as you look at other parts of our business where people deploy long lived infrastructure like fiber networks, wages are a portion of that deployment cost, not all of that deployment cost and they are capitalized and they are taken over the life of a product that stays in service for many, many, many years. So well, obviously, we'd like to pay less in wages. It's not the end of the world, when we're seeing a little bit of an uptick. It's a small portion of the cost of deployment and we can ultimately recover that over the long-life cycle of the product, especially if prices ultimately go up in the market. Now to your question of pricing, I'm not going to give away or announce anything here that -- it's not appropriate to do that. But I'll go back to the comments I made a couple of weeks ago, which is broadly across the board in the economy right now, we are seeing inflationary pressures and the consumer is seeing that every place they go. It's my belief, if we do not see some moderation in this fairly quickly that, I think every business in the United States is going to be dealing with the cost of inputs. And I don't see the wireless industry being immune from that nor any other industry being immune from that.  And as I shared earlier, there's a lot of different ways you can deal with price adjustments. There's a lot of different tactics and approaches you can use. But when we're looking at the customer base as satisfied as we are, when we look at a customer base with some of the value we've been putting back into the product and service over time, when we look at our current churn levels do we believe we're in a position, if we're forced into a situation where we have to start maybe taking some price that we can do that and move it through? Our history would suggest that we know how to do that, and we can do that. And we'll be very smart and judicious as we have to apply it. But running this business and not sitting here and evaluating where we have options to move on pricing and be successful, I wouldn't be doing my job properly. And I want to maybe go back to a comment I made in my opening remarks. If you look at what we've done in our fiber product this last quarter. We went to a simplified price structure, I want everybody to understand what this means. We are not out in the market right now selling on 12-month promotional pricing on broadband. We are selling the customer on a stable price to the duration of the relationship with us. In many cases, we're in the market at a minimum of $10 higher to the promotional price that cable or the other broadband competitors have in the market.  And our volumes were still stellar and they're continuing to grow, and we're doing incredibly well in that market. And it's a reflection of the value of the product and the service that we're bringing in that we're able to do that. It's an example of us being able to smartly understand where there's value and where there's opportunity for us to work the overall value equation, including price to be able to manage our business effectively and we'll continue to do that. Brett Feldman : Thank you. John Stankey : Thanks very much, Brett. Operator can you shift to next question? Operator : Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hey, a couple of follow-ups first. Let's dig into the postpaid phone adds a little more this quarter. Was there any impact from your own 3G shutdown on the reported adds? And what about the shutdown of T-Mobile CDMA network? Do you see any impact there in the first quarter or maybe second quarter? John Stankey : Phil, the short answer is no on the first one. As you know, we don't \u2013 when we count net adds, a migration of the 3G customer to another service plan isn't a net add, that's just the migration. And so there wouldn't be any impact to that. And as we've shared with you, we restated our base numbers. Those are out there for you to see. And so, I think, everything you can look at, including looking at ARPU characteristics after the restatement, you should look at it. And I would actually say, this is probably one of the best air interface transitions I've ever seen. When I think about the shutdown of the 2G network and now the shutdown of the 3G network on a proportional basis and the number of subscribers and what we're able to do here, I think, the team executed incredibly well. Relative to the flow share in the market today, I think, we have seen over the last several quarters, Sprint is -- had an issue for T-Mobile to migrate and manage. And I know they're having to touch that base, as they're shutting down the CDMA network and moving things through. And any time you do that, that can be disruptive to a customer base. And I think we've benefited in some flow share from Sprint customers who have been evaluating what they want to do and see AT&T as a good choice and a good value as they make that decision to whether or not they want to get a new handset and who they want to get it with. And there has been an element of that in the flow share in the market over, not just this last quarter, but several quarters as this has been going on. And there was an element of it in this quarter, but I don't think it was anything that was out of pattern from what we saw in previous quarters. Pascal Desroches : Yes. Phil, just as a reference point, 300,000 of the net adds this quarter were from FirstNet. Again, nothing to do with the 3G migrations. Phil Cusick : Okay. And then second, if I can. Well, you\u2019ve a guide out there for 3% plus service -- wireless service revenue growth. You did 4.8% this quarter. Is there -- I mean, there's comping issues. But anything in the numbers that we should think is going to be a headwind that would drive a significant deceleration? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : We feel really good about how the business is performing. And we guided to 3% plus. As you've heard from John previously, this management team is in the realm of trying to put up guidance on a conservative end of a spectrum. With that said, the one thing I would remind you, as you move through next quarter, we're going to have a full three-month impact of the 3G migration, so that is going to hit ARPU some. But we feel really good about the overall pace of the business and how we're executing. Phil Cusick : Thanks, Pascal. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much. Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator : Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could talk about C-band a little bit. I think you said that you would be ramping the deployments later this year. If you could just give us some updates on when we expect that to really start scaling and what you're seeing in the supply chain then. And there's been a lot written about fixed wireless recently, and we've seen some good momentum in that market. As you get the C-band up, what do you think in terms of out-of-market opportunities or even the opportunity to upgrade some of your DSL base that may not be getting fiber anytime soon or non-fiber based? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Simon. So the scaling on C-band is happening now, and it will continue. We're not -- as we told you, we're deploying mid-year. That's when we have the right kind of equipment for our OneTouch work between the two different spectrum bands that we can touch the tower once and move through. We have capabilities to do pre-work on that. Obviously, there are things that we can deploy today to get ourselves ready, make sure that we're in the right position. And we can start spending on and be in a position to scale that, turn up pretty rapidly as we hit midyear. So, I'd say, as we told you, you're already seeing it move into some of the capital numbers in this quarter and it will continue to ramp as we move through the middle of the year. And then that positions us to do the rapid turnup in the second half of the year and hit the POP targets that we've communicated to you through the Analyst Day. On supply chain, I'm conservative on this. I don't ever want to say we're in good hands, but here's the dynamic that I think is occurring. I actually think for the industry in aggregate globally, there are going to be some supply chain pressures, at least from what I know, where chip manufacturing is, it's going back into some of the key OEMs. However, I think what you should keep in mind is that the North American market is an incredibly profitable market for providers of equipment on a global basis. If you were to start ranking it relative to other continents, it is the most profitable market of any continent out there. And so as a result of that, if you're into a situation where there's some degree of constraint, I think if you're an equipment manufacturer, you have the motivation to make sure that you supply your most profitable market first. And as a result of that, I don't want to say that we're out of the woods, but I think that we're likely to see a prioritization given the dynamics of this market that may put other parts of the globe a little bit lower down the list in terms of availability of equipment and services moving forward. So, right now, I think we have a good handle on things. Our vendors are telling us they can meet our build expectations. We've done a lot of second order diligence on our equipment. We're not just taking their word for it. We look at sourcing on key components within if we can't do every element. And sometimes it's the smallest and silliest things that end up causing a problem. We've looked at the harder things like at chip levels and feel that there's confidence in those estimates right now that they can bring them through. And so I'm not expecting that to be a problem. But as you know, the global supply chains are fragile right now and crazy things happen, whether it's neon gas coming out of the Ukraine or whatever, and we'll continue to work through that. On the fixed wireless side, I think you hit the nail on the head. Look, we have hundreds of thousands of fixed wireless subscribers already. We've used it pretty aggressively in parts of the business segment where a particular business customer that we support finds it to be the right and best solution for how their particular business is set up. We continue to believe that there are going to be applications for fixed wireless deployment moving forward, and we think our network will be well suited to do that after we get through the mid-band deployment. But to your point, it's going to be what I would call use specific. I don't intend to go into dense urban and metropolitan areas where I can build fiber infrastructure and offer broadband and try to use fixed wireless as the solution to serve broadband customers where we see estimates traffic growing 5x over the next five years and performance requirements needing to get significantly better. And we watch our Fiber base, we watch our customers and we don't believe -- we watch our copper base of customers, and we don't believe a product that's doing sub 100 megabits is going to be a viable product in the market over the next couple of years based on how we're seeing consumers use the service and what they expect to do in some of these urban areas where there's broader and more dense environments, with more people in a living unit. But there are clearly places in more rural areas where fixed wireless will be the best way to get the most amount of bandwidth out to a customer. And we believe we can play in those spaces, and there'll be some former ADSL locations where fixed wireless will be a substantial step-up in opportunity. And there's going to be places where the government comes in with subsidy in very less densely populated areas that fixed wireless is going to be the solution. And sure, there may be some niche customers who can live on a very niche oriented product for their particular use characteristic and find it interesting, but I don't believe that's the main part of the market. And I think it's really hard to market niche broadband products, frankly, over time. And I think market performance of what we're able to do is we blanket an area with a robust fixed fiber broadband service are showing in the numbers that we're putting up in our performance in the market right now. Simon Flannery : Right. Thank you. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much. Operator, if we can move to the next caller. Operator : David Barden, Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. A few higher-level questions about the new AT&T, John -- or maybe the old AT&T, depending on how you think about it. Is the new AT&T -- maybe -- I'm going to be greedy, I have three questions. Number one, is the new AT&T, a dividend yielder or a dividend grower? The second question is, John, last -- I think at the Analyst Day, you previewed that your plan was -- after the separation, that you would refresh AT&T's go-to-market plan. I was wondering if you could maybe share an evolution of those thoughts or set some expectations around what we should see. And then finally, Pascal, could you describe and maybe share a little of the geography about how the go-forward financial relationship between AT&T and WarnerMedia Discovery will work, i.e., offering HBO Max for free in the wireless business and those sorts of things? That will be super helpful. Thank you so much guys. John Stankey : Hi, Dave. Let me give the front end. I'll try to do all three of them and Pascal can jump in and offer anything he wants. I think we're a dividend competitor moving forward, meaning I want the dividend to remain at a competitive level relative to others out in the market, which means I'll pay attention to the yield of the dividend. As we've told you, as we move past 2023 and we start to think about what we do with discretionary capital, as we have the balance sheet where we want it to be, the Board is going to evaluate where the best returns come back into the business. And there's a lot of choices at that point. That could be what we choose to do on equity, could be choose on what we choose to do with dividend, it could be choose -- could be choices on we make -- what we make within the deployment on new business opportunities within the business for organic growth. We'll evaluate those in the complete portfolio where we stand and the relative competitiveness of the value proposition of the AT&T equity with others in the market and adjust accordingly. And so to answer your question, we'll pay attention to the yield, but I don't necessarily intend to every quarter look at it and say my expectation is that I have to grow the dividend in any given quarter relative to not answering the question of how do we stand competitively in the market and whether or not we think we've got the right kind of mix of how we're investing our capital and deploying it within the business. When you ask about refreshing the go-to-market plan, it could possibly be two things you're driving that. One could be comments I've made about what we're doing to refine the brand. If that's kind of the angle that you're going after, is that where your question is? David Barden : I think more specifically, John, the market's seen your kind of \u2013 and you highlight this as a positive, your very consistent go-to-market plan on customer retention, the new and existing customer, hence that upgrade plan. It's been pretty solid for almost two years now. And I think you hinted that, there would be a change. And I think people were interested in hearing a little bit more about it. John Stankey : Well, there'll be a change when it doesn't work, and it's working just fine. And I'm probably not going to tell you what the change is going to be when it doesn't work anymore because that would kind of be self-defeating. But it's working just fine. And I would have guessed maybe last year that we might be hitting a point where we had to think about it differently, we're not. And I think that's great. We have thoughts on where our next path will go, if we need to go down that path. But we're not at that point at this juncture. I love the momentum we're seeing. I think it was a great quarter. I like what we're seeing right now. And I like that we're watching others having to, in any given week or month, adjust their approach in the market while we continue to do exactly what we're doing. And as we continue to have the opportunity to grow our footprint between the two services, it opens up even more opportunity for us to do things on a combined basis that we're seeing really good progress on. Admittedly, our new footprint is still relatively small. It will grow over time. But I'm really excited about what that means for us moving forward in the future. And I think as I would stress, one of the things that's really important to understand is we're not getting our growth just through one set of go-to-market actions here. I know you're focused and you're thinking about what we're doing in the consumer space right now. But I want to stress, FirstNet has been really strong for us. What we're doing in the business customers that we have close relationships have been really strong for us. We're going to see us start to grow in some wholesale revenues later this year that we have not had in our mix up to this point in time. So our growth portfolio is a balanced portfolio and it's not hinging on any one strategy. And I've been saying this all along, you need to understand that there's not any one thing we're doing, it's a variety of things that we're doing on distribution that are adding up to the sum total of this and feel good about that. Your last question on financial relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery, we expect there's going to continue to be a relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery going forward. I expect that, that relationship will still be important to both companies. But I don't expect over time that it's going to be ultimately exclusive. I think Warner Bros. Discovery will want flexibility to be able to do things with a variety of players in the market. I think I understand why they'd want to do that. I think there are things that AT&T can do to accommodate that and still have the right value proposition for our customers moving forward. But I still expect there'll be a strong trading relationship given what we've had in the market is a portion of the success that we've had in being able to keep and retain customers moving forward. And we'll fine-tune that a bit as we move forward and make sure it's right for both companies. But I don't expect that it will continue to be what I call a captive or exclusive arrangement. Pascal, do you want to add anything? Pascal Desroches : The only point, Dave, I'd say on your first question on the dividend yield growth. We've said this, the way we're thinking about generating returns going forward, dividends are only one part of it. We're going to hold ourselves accountable to growing earnings at the stock price. And it's a mix of overall return to our shareholders. And that's what we are looking to optimize overtime. John Stankey : Thanks very much, operator we can shift to the next question. Operator : Doug Mitchelson, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Doug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. Sort of, John, following up on the media side with regards to media streaming piracy, is there a place for AT&T to gain any economics by helping streaming services reduce piracy, given the breadth of your broadband footprint? I mean, Netflix losing $50 billion in market cap yesterday suggests there might be value to the streamers. And I would think it would be important to the value you're giving your customers of HBO or however that evolves?  And to help size that, how much password sharing did you see with HBO in the US? And then if I could just sort of follow up, Pascal, I just wanted a clarification. The CapEx guide, $20 billion of cash spend plus paying down $4 billion of vendor financing in 2022, what should we anticipate for CapEx purchased on new vendor finance? Thank you, both. John Stankey : Doug, so if I go back -- I don't know, I don't play a story in here, but if I go back probably three years ago, there were several comments I made or observations I made about the SVOD business, one of which was that managing customer subscriptions was going to be an important element of the long-term sustainability of the business. And that was at a time when I think somewhere in the industry may be advocating that rampant password sharing was somehow a good thing for these products.  And I had a little bit more jaded view of that. I think there were probably some articles that were written to criticize me for having a little bit more jaded view of that. But it drove a lot of the thought process at the front end of the HBO Max product where we were thoughtful about how we built the product. We were thoughtful about making sure that we give customers enough flexibility, but we don't want to see rampant abuse. And so, I'm not going to go into all the details, but there were a lot of things and features built in to the product that are consistent with the user agreement, that has terms and conditions of how they can and can't use it. And we've enforced, and we've enforced them obviously in a way that I think has been customer-sensitive.  You don't see anybody complaining massively about it.  But I can tell you that we actively, in any given month are looking at how particular users are using the product and have features and capabilities technically to limit what I would call rampant abuse. And so, I would tell you that I think that's the right way for the industry to be managed. And I think maybe some are going to adjust practices and approaches overtime to try to get their arms around that, but I don't think it's the broadband providers' role in making that happen. I think it's the owner of the applications role in making that happen.  And I don't necessarily expect that we'd be trying to work on a product or service to market back to other providers to say we can help you manage that. I think there are adequate tools available in software and then how you manage your application to be able to do that. And I can tell you from our own experience, we feel like we've done that reasonably effectively in the interest of the product. I'll let Pascal go ahead and maybe pick up the second part of the question. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Doug, here's the way I think about. We haven't provided guidance specifically on how much better financing commitments will enter into each year, but we provided overall cash payment guidance. And so we provided for 2022 and 2023, both years is $24 billion. So anything we do this year, we'd have to pay next year and that would be captured in that $24 billion guide. And so while we haven't provided guidance, you should have a pretty good sense about where the overall trajectory should be. Doug Mitchelson : All right. Thanks a lot. John Stankey : Thank you very much Doug. And time for one last question operator. Operator : Walt Piecyk, LightShed Partners. Please go ahead. Walt Piecyk : Thanks. Pascal, I was hoping to unpack some of the fiber comments you made earlier. You talked about rising subscriber growth over the course of the year. And then, John, you talked about basically higher ARPUs or basically charging $10 higher than cable. I guess first, when you look at the 289 that you did this quarter, what was the mix of conversions from your own customers versus taking it from other competitors that are out there? And then secondly, in terms of Fiber, if you think about higher pricing, are you still seeing that kind of the penetration rate after year one and year two that we've historically seen when other companies have built out fiber, or is the higher pricing changing kind of the penetration rate that you think you can achieve for a second, third year of rolling out these new services? John Stankey : Yes. Well, let me see if I can answer your question, and Pascal can jump in if he wants to. First of all, we don't disclose the mix. But what I would say to you is, what you should understand is, we do give you some information that you should be able to understand that we're getting a healthy growth of new subscribers to AT&T. You know, I think our aggregate share numbers in broadband in the market today and you know where those stand. We shared with you that our plan rates after we're in the market about three years has roughly an equal split of market share, which is a substantial increase to where our aggregate market share in our broadband business previously stood. You can't -- three-year period of time of fiber growth to get to equivalent market share in an area, do that without taking customers from the other side of the house. It's mathematically impossible to do that. And so I think the way you think about it, if I were in your shoes, an analyst, and you look at cash flows over a three-year period and you look at footprint expansion and you see that market shift, you should conclude over time that we're actually picking up, as I've described it, share points in a way that I've never seen a product move in my career. Now admittedly, we put a lot of money into this infrastructure. And we should expect to see that kind of share point move, and we're getting it. So we are winning our share of new customers as a result of this. And we report to you as well our aggregate revenues, and we report to you our growth and decline in our fiber and our copper base. And I think it's pretty easy for you to see the motion of what's happening in the copper base as to how much of it is likely moving to fiber and how much of it isn't. And I feel really good about how we're competitively performing. I see nothing in our performance that suggests we should be tamping down ultimate pen rates because of our approach. Quite the opposite, as we shared with you, our pen rates are accelerating, they're not declining. If you look at where we were several years ago and a lot of our new builds right now, we're achieving year two pen rates in year one. And there's a lot of reasons behind that, not just one. The great product is the foundation of it. The part of it is how we're building right now, we're much less Swiss cheese, which allows us to be a lot more effective in our marketing. And we've developed much better tactics as we move into a neighborhood to be able to get early adopters to move in at a much higher rate and pace. And that has a huge impact on the economics of the business case. If we sustain that moving forward, I'm going to frankly be relooking the overall economics of the fiber business case because one of the big variables on leverage in the business case is if you can accelerate your penetration by a year, it dramatically improves the return characteristics. So I'm really proud of what the team has done in that regard. And we have no expectation by the time we get to year three that, that's going to suggest that we shouldn't expect our split of the market as a result of that. Remember, we're not charging more to the customer. We're giving the customer a better experience. We're getting rid of promotional pricing; it is a pain point for customers. They hate it. They hate the 12-month mark. And when they're using another service, that 12-month mark means their price is going up $15 or $20, and that's just a really bad thing for a customer. And so now we put out a very simple, straightforward constant price, where the customer isn't going to see that step up in 12 months. They know what the equipment pricing is on the front end. They're getting the square deal. They're getting a great product. And they're clams and it shows in the data. Walt Piecyk : Thanks. And apparently, I guess the high split investments, if you can call it that by cable, is not really helping to fight those sheer shifts. Can I just switch to wireless, John? You mentioned about wholesale as another component of growth. And then I looked at the wholesale revenue this quarter, and it didn't move much from Q1. I guess that just implies that you're in the very early stages of the shift of that DISH wholesale traffic to your network. How do we expect that to ramp? Is it linear? Is it -- I know you've already started to connect to DISH. How should that play out over the course of 2022 and 2023? John Stankey : That's an accurate assumption, Walt. It has to do with the ramp directly from DISH. And I think the way you should think about this, it's public information, that I think DISH got a little bit of a reprieve from T-Mobile on some of the legacy network availability and some help on that slowed down the front end a little bit. And I think you're aware of where DISH is in their deployment and debugging their network so that it actually can function and work properly. I think they recently announced a milestone as to what they're doing around that. Those two things are the drivers of when that transition occurs, a combination of when those customers need to move off of another network as well as, as DISH starts to move people onto their network, new customers coming in, those all play in the wholesale arrangement as that volume starts to ramp. So, I think a surrogate for understanding that trend line, we'll be watching the loading of new customers on to DISH's new network capabilities. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Walt. And with that, I'll turn it over to John for some final comments. John Stankey : Just really briefly to all of you. First of all, thanks for joining us today. And I really want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all of you on the call. I know it's been going on internally at AT&T in terms of the number of filings, schedules we've had to develop, the information we've had to put out over the course of the last month or so. And I know that, that puts a lot of work on all of you to kind of parse through that, get through this transition that we've been working through as a business. I want to extend my appreciation for your patience in that regard. And what I can promise is it should settle down here a little bit going forward. And I'm as excited about that as I'm sure you are. So, thanks very much for being with us today, and we'll talk to you again in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's panel, we'd like to thank you for your participation, and thank you for using AT&T. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. I also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 108. So unfortunately, we can't answer questions about that today. And as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, I shared that AT&T had entered a new era with the right asset base capabilities and financial structure to become America's best broadband provider. I'm happy to share this morning that we're continuing our progress, improving our infrastructure and expanding our customer base across our twin engines of growth, 5G and Fiber. We saw historic levels of second quarter net additions, thanks to our discipline and consistent go-to-market strategy and solid execution, building fiber and deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum assets. In Mobility, we brought in the most second quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, just like last quarter, building on our momentum from 2021. It\u2019s noteworthy that we've sustained this momentum in a highly competitive environment. Industry growth in the first half of 2022 has been stronger than the expectations I shared with you late last year. In our view, this strong performance reinforces that our success is not solely promotion-led, but instead reflective of our improved value proposition in the market. Even though better-than-anticipated customer growth metrics resulted in some higher-than-expected success-based investment, ARPU and profitability in 2Q improved and we expect that trend line to accelerate in the second half of the year. As Pascal will discuss shortly, we're, in fact, increasing our service revenue growth guidance for 2022. In Fiber, we continue to invest in building out a premium network, drive a great build velocity and deliver on our stated expectations for accelerated customer growth through improved penetration rates. We're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets, with what we believe is the best wired Internet offering available. This is evidenced by our more than 300,000 second quarter AT&T Fiber net adds, marking our 10th straight quarter with more than 200,000 Fiber net adds. The strength and value of the AT&T Fiber experience is enabling us to increase share in our Fiber footprint and convert more IP broadband Internet subscribers to Fiber subscribers. Ultimately, our Fiber strategy is a sustainable and long-term technology play that will support key macro trends. We expect to see a continuation of favorable ARPU trends, as we expand the availability of what we believe is a best-in-class network with a multi-decade lifespan. So I'm very pleased with the strong customer growth we're seeing. Our success only reinforces the improved value proposition we're providing. And we expect our investment in top-tier technology to translate into strong resiliency for our services for years to come. Over the last 8 quarters, we've achieved an industry-best 6 million postpaid phone net adds, while adding nearly 2.3 million AT&T Fiber customers, increasing our Fiber subscriber base by more than 50%. I'm also very proud with the progress our teams have made in rapidly expanding our 5G and fiber footprints. I'm pleased to say that we've achieved our target of covering 70 million mid-band POPs, 2 quarters ahead of our year-end target, and are now on track to approach 100 million mid-band POPs by the end of this year. And our expanded Consumer Wireline fiber footprint now gives us the ability to serve 18 million customer locations. This is an increase of nearly 2 million from the start of the year.  Our teams are running hard to deliver these world-class services to our customers. And we expect our commitment to investing in our core connectivity networks to serve as the foundation for AT&T's growth for decades to come. Moving to our second major priority. It's more important than ever, we'd be effective and efficient across our operations. The dispositions we executed over the last 2 years provide us with operating flexibility to adjust, as needed, what is proving to be an increasingly pressured economic backdrop without requiring us to materially compromise on our investment priorities and financial obligations.  We have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. As we shared before, we've initially reinvested these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses. However, as we enter the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to contribute to the bottom line. As you're likely aware, we're taking proactive measures, such as selective pricing adjustments, to address as much of the very real inflationary pressures that are clearly impacting all parts of our economy. The pricing strategy we implemented is being executed in a proactive and methodical way that enables some of our longest-standing customers the opportunity to take advantage of our most robust offers, while also ensuring that we're responding to the real-time cost pressures in our business. I believe we've navigated this difficult reality effectively and, thus far, are seeing results that are consistent with our expectations, although not sufficient to cover all inflationary impacts. Last quarter, I shared that we're seeing inflationary pressures. And we estimate those to be more than $1 billion above the elevated cost expectations embedded into our outlook. We're clearly operating in different times, and the macroeconomic backdrop is evolving in a dynamic manner. Still, we're confident in our ability to emerge in this chapter, a stronger company, thanks to our position as one of the world's largest-scaled telecom operators, our improved underlying financial flexibility, the cost reduction initiatives we have in place, the essential nature of the services we provide and our pricing actions that help partially offset these impacts.  With that said, the current environment is not easy to predict. We're seeing more pressure on Business Wireline than expected. And on the consumer side of our business, we're seeing an increase in bad debt to slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels as well as extended cash collection cycles. However, it's important to note that historical patterns in previous economic cycles suggest customers have managed their accounts similar to what we're experiencing today. In fact, we feel even better about the resiliency of our services, given the elevated importance of connectivity in everyone's lives. We view this cycle no differently and still expect customers will pay their bills, albeit a little less timely. Furthermore, as I mentioned before, we feel better about our underlying financial flexibility that we have in quite a while. This is why we're confident, we can maintain our focus for growth over the long term by investing in the future of connectivity through 5G and fiber. It's our belief that near-term cyclical economic uncertainty does not warrant a retrenchment in the deployment of long-lived assets. The long-term economic justification for these investments remain sound. And timing of the market development supports our intent to invest through this cycle. Importantly, we maintained our focus on paying down debt, with the $40 billion in proceeds from the completion of the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction in April, helping us to significantly reduce our net debt in the quarter. I'd also like to touch on free cash flow directly. While free cash did come in lower than we expected this quarter, there were several notable factors that drove this. The first is the timing of higher success-based investments on the back of our robust customer growth. Additionally, we front-end loaded our capital investment plans in order to kick-start our growth initiatives. We expect these plans to seasonally moderate through the course of the year, as we achieve our $24 billion in capital investment plan. And I'm pleased we've been able to effectively manage our supply chain and front-end load some of our work this year. In addition to these investment-driven impacts, we're seeing some longer collection cycles and inflationary costs that we've not been successful in fully offsetting. These cash flow impacts, along with expectations for a more tempered economic climate in the latter half of the year, have led us to adjust our cash flow expectations for the full year, even with our expected material improvements over the next 2 quarters. The key takeaway is that we understand the emerging economic pressures on our business and feel confident in our ability to manage through them while, at the same time, investing for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. While we're not immune to the pressures impacting the broader economy, the repositioning of our business to focus on core connectivity solutions, the underlying financial flexibility achieved through a significant reduction of our debt and the ability to invest in access technologies built for the long term allows us to opportunistically maneuver through this economic climate. Finally, I want to take a moment to discuss our Business Wireline unit and our focused efforts to reposition the asset. There is a sizable base of business revenue coming from legacy voice and data services. This business is increasingly facing secular pressures as customers replace traditional voice services with mobile and other collaboration solutions. On the data front, VPN and legacy transport services are being impacted by technology transitions to software-based solutions. Today, approximately half of our segment revenue comes from these types of services. Last quarter, we shared that we're experiencing additional government sector pressure related to the reallocation of spending priorities. This pressure, tied to the timing and restructuring of government spending, continued in 2Q. While we're hopeful that some spending will return and the Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions contract volumes and share gains will offset pricing reductions over time, we consider it prudent to reset expectations. It's worth noting that approximately 20% of the year-over-year Business Wireline revenue declines in the second quarter were due to government spending impacts. Lastly, we saw inflation and wholesale network access charges we incur to provide services to customers outside of our footprint due to contractual resets. This cost pressure resulted in more than 20% of the segment's year-over-year EBITDA decline. This pressure will be managed through opportunities to operate more efficiently movement of traffic to alternate providers, symmetrical wholesale pricing adjustments and natural product migration trends. Looking ahead, these developments only strengthen our resolve in executing our transformation, including actions to accelerate cost takeouts and simplify our product portfolio. We expect these actions to mitigate the year-over-year pressure in this segment's profitability over time. But we now expect Business Wireline EBITDA declines in the low double digits this year. And our expectation for stabilization extends to the back half of 2024. However, we remain confident in our efforts to reposition the segment. The deployment of fiber is leading to an acceleration of growth each quarter in our connectivity solutions, which delivered close to 15% growth this quarter. Our fiber expansion also provides us with the ability to gain market share in SMB, which is an underpenetrated segment for us. Moreover, we continue to utilize our business relationships to expand opportunities in Mobility. Since last year, we've taken more than 1 full point of share in the business Mobility space. Our focus on Fiber and 5G continues to gain traction. And we expect to use our strong enterprise and growing SMB relationships to take advantage of opportunities as they expand. We know this transformation won't happen overnight, but similar to our turnarounds in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, we're confident we have the right strategy in place and in our ability to execute it successfully. I'll now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details for the quarter. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, our consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with customers. In the quarter, we had a remarkable 813,000 postpaid phone net adds, our best second quarter in more than a decade. Looking at Fiber, we had 316,000 net adds as we delivered upon our expectations to accelerate our subscriber growth. Our Fiber deployment plans remain on track. And we expect to continue our solid momentum with customers. Now let's move to our second quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 6. First, it's important to note, with the closing of the WarnerMedia transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present WarnerMedia and certain other divested businesses, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic, as discontinued operations. While continuing operations provide a clear view of our remaining operations, keep in mind that there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior year results also include DIRECTV and certain other dispositions. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis in addition to continuing from operations. Comparative revenues for the quarter were $29.6 billion, up 2.2% or more than $600 million year-over-year. This was largely driven by wireless revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline. Comparative adjusted EBITDA was up 1.7% year-over-year as growth in Wireless, Mexico and lower corporate costs were partially offset by Business Wireline declines. We continue to expect the year-over-year EBITDA trend line to progressively improve through the year as we begin to lap 3G shutdown costs and step-up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.65. On a comparative stand-alone AT&T basis, adjusted EPS was $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. Adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude a gain in our benefit plans, noncash restructuring and impairment charges and our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization. Cash from operations for our continuing operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter. Capital investments of $6.7 billion was up $1.7 billion year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion. DIRECTV cash distributions were $800 million in the quarter. Cash flow for the quarter was affected by several key factors. First, as expected, we had higher front-end loaded capital investments as we ramped our Fiber and 5G mid-band spectrum deployment. As John already noted, we expect lower capital investment levels in the back half of the year, in line with our expectations of $24 billion. The second is the timing of consumer collections, as it's taking about 2 more days than last year to collect customer receivables. The impact of this is almost $1 billion for the quarter. The last item is some incremental success-based investments, including device payments tied to accelerate subscriber growth. Now let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues its record-level momentum. Revenues were up 5.2%, with service revenues growing 4.6% driven by subscriber growth. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $54.81, up $0.81 sequentially or 1.1% year-over-year. This is ahead of our prior expectations for stabilizing in the second half of the year. This improvement is largely a result of more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans and improved roaming trends. Our June pricing actions were a modest benefit as well. But given the timing of the increases, we would expect our pricing access to be a larger factor in the back half of the year. Given our expectations for ARPU, we now expect service revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% for the year. That is up from our previously stated expectations of 3%-plus. Mobility EBITDA increased 2.5% year-over-year despite an approximately $100 million impact from lower CAFII government credits and higher FirstNet cost. We also had around $130 million of higher bad debt expense during the quarter. While bad debt is now slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels, it is being offset by better-than-expected customer revenue growth. We remain confident that Mobility-adjusted EBITDA growth accelerates in the second half of the year, due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3G shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021.  Again, our customer growth performance was better than we expected, especially when you consider we became less active in promotional activities compared to others in our industry. So it's clear to us that the strategic change we made to simplify our go-to-market strategy 2 years ago continue to yield great results and that our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on Slide 8. Our Fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. Our total Consumer Wireline revenues were up again this quarter, even with declines from copper-based broadband services. Broadband revenues grew 5.6% due to fiber revenue growth and higher broadband ARPU, driven by a customer mix shift to fiber and recent broadband pricing actions.  Our Fiber ARPU was $61.65, up 5.3% year-over-year, with gross addition intake ARPU in the $65 to $70 range. We expect overall Fiber ARPU to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs. We accelerated our fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 18 million customer locations with great AT&T Fiber experience that consistently receives high Net Promoter Scores. As you heard at Analyst Day, our planned center on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that. We continue to expect EBITDA growth to accelerate through the remainder of 2022, driven by continued growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021. Looking at Business Wireline, as John stated, revenues and earnings came in lower than we expected. There are 2 main factors that are driving the shortfall to our expectation. The first is lower revenue than anticipated from the government sector. The second is inflationary pressure on wholesale network access costs. On a combined basis, these 2 factors accounted for about $100 million in EBITDA pressure year-over-year. While the Business Wireline transition and portfolio rationalization creates incremental pressure on near-term revenues, it underscores the importance of transitioning to our owned and operated connectivity services as well as growing 5G and Fiber-integrated solutions. In fact, our connectivity services revenue growth continues to accelerate, as we are up nearly 15% year-over-year. Both areas, Business 5G and Fiber, continue to perform well with Business Wireline service revenue growth of 7.4% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base of more than 300,000. Before we shift to questions, I want to provide you an update on how we are thinking about the rest of the year, given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in. As I mentioned previously, we like the momentum in our Mobility business, both on a service revenue and EBITDA basis. While we maintain expectations that 2022 industry postpaid phone demand levels are unlikely to replicate 2021, the strength we experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with better ARPU trends, give us confidence in our raised service revenue outlook and expectations for an improved EBITDA trajectory. On Consumer Wireline, we are largely trending on plan, given mix shift to higher ARPU fiber plants, which is driving both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. On Business Wireline, you know the near-term challenges we are facing, which reduces our expectations. We now expect Business Wireline to decline in the low double-digit EBITDA range for the year. Putting this all together, we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS within our prior guidance ranges for the year. Moving to free cash flow. Given the combination of elevated success-based investment, the potential for further extension of payments by our customers, inflation and the more challenging environment facing our Business Wireline unit, we consider it prudent to take a more conservative outlook to free cash flow for the year. Given these factors, we anticipate pressure of about $2 billion to our free cash flow guidance from our prior $16 billion range for the year. Now before the questions on how we get to the implied $10 billion of free cash flow in the second half of the year when we generated $4 billion in the first half of the year, let me provide you with some specific items to consider.  Our outlook reflects the following expectations : $3 billion-plus lower device payment versus the first half of the year due to timing, nearly $2 billion lower capital investment versus the first half of the year as we reach our $24 billion expectations for the full year. The balance of the improvement relative to the first half of the year is due to wireless customer growth, including our recent pricing increases and lower cash interest expense. We expect these benefits to be partially offset by reduced distributions from DIRECTV and our expectations for incremental tax payments in the second half of the year. However, we do expect full year tax payments to be lower than we previously anticipated. Additionally, we expect typical free cash flow seasonality with the fourth quarter higher than the third quarter. Although we're not providing an updated 2023 outlook, we expect improved cash conversion of EBITDA in 2023. Here's how. Better Mobility cash flow as we get a full year benefit from a larger subscriber base at higher ARPU level. We expect MVNO volumes to ramp and become more material through the course of the year. International roaming trends should improve as well. We expect broadband revenue growth from the mix shift to higher-priced fiber to continue. On the cost structure, we expect a full year benefit from our cost transformation efforts implemented in 2022 in conjunction with reaching our $6 billion-plus target by the end of 2023. Additionally, the cost actions we plan to execute in Business Wireline in the second half of the year should produce more than $300 million of savings in 2023 relative to 2022. Also recall that we have no 3G shutdown costs in 2023. In addition, we expect lower cash interest expense as we get a full year benefit from the debt paydown actions taken in 2022. All these factors should more than offset the expected lower distribution from DIRECTV and an expected year-over-year increase in cash taxes. In summary, there is no doubt we're operating in a dynamic macro environment, but we feel confident in both the resilient nature of our business and the underlying financial flexibility we gained from recent dispositions. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : [Technical Difficulty] John Stankey : John, you're breaking up. John Hodulik : Okay. Can you hear me now? John Stankey : Yes. John Hodulik : Okay. Yes, 2 parts. First, on the -- I guess, for Pascal. [Technical Difficulty]. John Stankey : John, sorry, you're breaking up right now. Why don't we go to the next question and reconnect you? John Hodulik : Okay. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Just coming back to the 2023 free cash flow. Can you help us a little bit with the CapEx? Is that still expected to be about $24 billion before dropping off the following year, especially given that you've said you've pulled forward some of the 5G spend. And I guess any updated thoughts on what you want to do in terms of fiber? Are you going to continue at this 3.5 million, 4 million homes or locations a year, and you're going to stop at 30 million? What's the latest thought there? And then you've referenced DIRECTV a couple of times. I just want to make clear, has anything changed at DIRECTV? Or is this just a quarterly kind of cadence of the payments? Or are you still expecting the same distributions that you put out in your guidance for the '22 and '23 as overall? Pascal Desroches : Sure. Thanks, Simon. Look, the thing is I think you have to keep in mind is one of the things that we -- when we did all the dispositions, we wanted -- our plan was to invest significantly this year and next year, both the $24 billion level. And as you see so far, the momentum in our business remains really strong. Those investments are providing attractive returns. And everything we see suggests that these were really good decisions. So yes, we are expecting $24 billion next year. We continue to expect to deploy fiber at the pace we've previously guided. And as it relates to DIRECTV, nothing has changed at all. We expected around $4 billion this year. As you can see from the first couple of quarters, that's more front-end loaded. And as we -- and next year, we expect $3 billion. So nothing has changed in that regard. And we feel really good about how the business is performing. Simon Flannery : Great. And just a quick follow-up. On the price increases, what's your early read of what customers are doing? Are they paying the extra $6 or $12? Are they migrating to unlimited plans? Is that accretive or not? And any surprises on churn? John Stankey : Everything is tracking as we kind of expected when we laid it out, Simon. As I shared with you, I think when we indicated we were going to do it, what we have is past models from executing these types of things that allow us to go and try to evaluate how customers are going to react and behave when the changes occur. And in this particular case, we had a great opportunity to ensure that, while we are going through a price increase on a segment of plans, we were able to also provide the option for a customer to think about moving to other plants and ultimately get more value, and I think, in many cases, very attractive characteristics associated with that. And we're seeing customers do both. In some cases, they're choosing to pay the increase of their existing plan and not move. But as you would expect, there's a degree of inertia in any subscription base. Sometimes it takes a little bit of time for somebody to process what's occurred and react. And we're also seeing some use as an opportunity to migrate into better plans and trade up and take not only some of that value that we're giving. But as you're seeing, we're starting to drive the improvements in ARPUs that we told you would occur. And certainly, this is a component of that happening. But I would tell you, it is tracking as we expected. It will be accretive as we expected. And I think everything we've given you for end of year forecast is consistent with what is occurring right now in the market in the early days of the change. Operator : Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : And I guess sort of a two-part question related to the timing issue that you highlighted with collections. So the first one is what gives you confidence it really is a timing issue and not really a non-payment issue? You alluded to some prior experience in different economic cycles. So I was hoping you can maybe just elaborate on that. And then I'm curious to what extent this might be shaping the way you think about going to market, particularly in your wireless business. As you move into the back half of the year, you've obviously done very well with a certain offer or a suite of promotions. Does it make sense to maintain the same promotional stance in a more difficult environment, particularly where there may be some timing issues? It certainly seems like your financial guidance anticipates lower volumes in the back half. But if that's a misunderstanding, any color there would be helpful. John Stankey : Brett, first of all, I'd say that our most recent experience in looking at kind of a challenged cycle is probably coming out of the 2008 recession and the dynamic around it. And as I indicated in my earlier remarks, we've evaluated that. We look at that. And that was a pretty stressed time, if you recall. And I don't know that I can exactly predict what's going to occur over the next year or so. But my guess is it probably won't be quite as shocking as that cycle is, what's occurred in a worst-case scenario. And we go back and we look at patterns and behaviors that have occurred in those cycles and evaluated them. And the other great thing we know that today is we have far better data than we've ever had that's more dynamic in how we do algorithmic scoring and things like that, that allow us to be even more effective in managing customer risk. So I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've got a reasonable record of data that allows us to do some projection on that as we start to see these things move. And as I said, this typically is not an issue of people not paying. It's an issue of when they pay. And I don't believe there's anything in our credit scoring and how we've looked at our customer base coming in that would cause those trends to be dramatically different than a previous period. In terms of how we go to market, I think we had a fantastic quarter. And I don't know that I want to go to market any differently than the quarter that we've put on the board. In fact, looking at many of your commentaries, you've been articulating that others have been much more aggressive in the market and probably leaning in to promotional activity in a heavier way. And I would say, I would characterize our approach as being much more tempered and consistent with the past. And we have not really responded to that increased promotional activity that we're seeing from others in the market right now. We've kind of been continuing to play our game. And we've put up a record quarter or a second quarter for ourselves in the 10-year period. And as I've told you before, we like each of these incremental subscribers we're bringing in. We think the economics of them are very strong, albeit there is investment at the front end to bring them on to the network. But I'm not going to shy away from that kind of growth. I don't know what the overall market is going to do for the next several quarters. I expect it will be, as I said in my comments, a bit more tepid as maybe economic stress comes in. But I've been saying that we expected it to be a little bit slower for the better part of 9 months now. And it hasn't materialized yet. We'll take the growth if it comes in. I expect it's going to slow a little bit. And I'm going to continue to play our game as long as it's working, and it's working right now. Pascal Desroches : And Brett, one other point as it relates to the overall credit quality of our customer base. While we did see an uptick in bad debt, overall, if there's nothing at all concerning, it's up slightly from pre-pandemic levels. So our call out here was really just a question investors, given the broader macro trends that are happening. So we're not, in any way, harmed by this. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick : A couple of follow-ups and one new one. Can you, John, talk anything about recent customer trends, June and July? You just said a minute ago, you expect things to slow down. But it doesn't sound like you've seen lower customer trends so far. It's a little surprising given the elevated DSOs. And it sounds like you guys don't have a lot of confidence in that 2023 free cash flow number. Is there just less visibility, so you don't want to cut that now? Or are you still reasonably confident in the $20 billion, and you think you can get there? We could use a little more. And then finally, can you just get into the recent launch of plans that don't include HBO? What's the potential cost savings from that shift of customers away? And what's been the reaction? John Stankey : Phil, so let me touch on these first. And then Pascal can come in and backfill to the extent you wishes to do so. So customer trends -- first of all, I don't want to go down a path on stuff we haven't disclosed. But the first part of July, as you'd expect, tends to be a little bit more suppressed because it's a high holiday and vacation period. And that's what I would call seasonal and cyclical, and we certainly saw a little bit of that occurring. But I've not seen anything in the market right now that suggests we're seeing a move away from what the first half of the year represented. And I think kind of moving into the second part of your question, I hate to describe it this way, but I think we got a little bit of a tale of 2 cities going on here. And when you see 9% inflation, it tends to hit those in the low end of the market really, really hard. And it's difficult when you walk up to the gas pump and have to fill the car, and you get the electric bill coming in and you see the kind of step-ups that people are seeing. And I think there's an adjustment period that goes on. The flip side is you've got another segment of the population that banked a lot of money during the pandemic. They weren't traveling. They weren't dining out. They were feeling a little bit more flush. And they're making different decisions. And as you know, our postpaid base is probably skewed a little bit more to the higher socioeconomic dynamics and probably a bit more insulated. But there is a portion of the base that clearly is starting to adjust to this dynamic that there's higher calls on their cash in any given quarter. And they're having to adjust betting patterns and behaviors and prioritization of how they order bills. And I think we're seeing that there's a little bit of that starting to occur. As Pascal said, it's not alarming in the way it's happening, but it is moving out collection cycles a bit, as we typically see when this type of stress starts to show up. And that's what the working capital issue is around it. So I would tell you, I don't see anything in here that would be out of pattern for this occurring. I think you've got 2 different parts of the economy, though, that are working in different ways. And how they develop over the course of the next several quarters is a little bit of a visibility issue, to be candid with you. And I don't know, if you'd asked me 6 months ago, we would be seeing 9% inflation annualized? I don't think I would have picked it as being that strong, but here we are. And now the question is, how fast do we eradicate it and what rate? And if you have a good pick on that or good insights, then I can probably be a little bit more precise than what I think '23 brings. I think what's important to understand is -- Pascal articulated in his comments is the fundamentals of the business are really strong. We feel really good about some of the mechanical things that will improve cash flow yields into '23. That's not going to change. But what happens in the overall economic pattern is a bit uncertain. And without seeing how the Fed reacts, how fast we see the curve starting to abate on the inflation side, trying to make that pick right now just feels like it's a bit of an overreach. And so I think we're reserving the right to get a little bit more visibility on '23 to declare. But I think the strong improvement dynamics are what I would call mechanical and the performance of the business is supporting the fact that we're going to see that improved conversion on cash flow as we move through the year. And then finally, on your question about the plans is, look, we still have a lot of streaming services in our base that we're using. We're trying a couple of different things. Part of this has been segment driven to look at opportunities for us to address areas that we think there is potential for stronger growth. And we shifted the mix of our plan and what we gave away, so to speak, in some of the benefits, especially as we were executing the price changes that we have talked about previously. And we felt that this quarter, and where we stood at working on things like more generous hotspot capabilities and better roaming moving into the summer, might be a better play in the market. And I would tell you, we kind of like what we saw in our results, despite a lot of the changes by others in the industry in terms of what their value proposition is to customers. And it feels like it was a good pivot and rotation at this moment for what we needed to do with the kind of changes we were making broadly in our plants. That doesn't mean that, that's the strategy forever. And it doesn't mean it's the strategy for the rest of the year. As we move through the summer months and we get through the peak travel periods and we look at what other options we have, we could choose to do something different in what we decide to do from a promotional perspective and what we choose to bring in as part of the bundles moving forward. I don't think anything should be viewed as static. And I think entertainment, as part of a wireless bundle, is probably something that's going to be around with us in this industry for a good period of time because I think customers -- certain customers resonate with it. And HBO Max is a great product. We like the fact that we're kind of viewed as being the place to come to get it. And when it's right for us to put that up in the front line to do that, we'll continue to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : So a follow-up and a question. When you're discussing some of the impact that your customers are experiencing this inflationary environment, can you talk about how AT&T is using the ACP program, the size of it, and the opportunity to use that, which may be different than some past cycles customers had deal with potentially tougher macro climate? And then secondly, just in terms of the infrastructure money that's out there, can you give us an update on your expectations for the size of the opportunity that AT&T could pursue? John Stankey : Sure, Michael. First of all, I think the most significant change in the ACP program is the fact that we have put out a new product, Access by AT&T. It's very easy for you to look at that product. All you need to do is search on the Internet, Access by AT&T., and you'll be taken directly to the page that talks about what this is. And it's, of course, tied to ACP dollars. And that program, I think, is a great program. I think it's good for the consumer. As you know, it offers 100 by $20 -- $30 fixed connection. And we also have options that are available in the wireless space around it as well. And we've been able to, in most of our channels, activate eligibility requirements for ACP. And we're working on ensuring that, that's done. The government still continues to move around a little bit on some of the qualification criteria and those types of things, and we have to adjust our operations. But I would say, by and large, in most of our mainline channels, we have the ability to qualify customers and to move them into products and service as a result of it. And I think this is a -- it's a healthy program to get those that maybe are a little bit more income challenged to get them into not only new products but better products. And so I think that's a good thing. I think we still have an issue from a policy perspective in this country on how we sustain this for the long haul. And universal service reform is going to need to be a key element of that as we get out several years from now and the original ACP funding starts to have to be renewed, and we have to look at it differently. But right now, I'd say the program is healthy. I think we're in as good a position as anybody in the market as to what we're doing. And it's needs based, but we make it very easy for those needs-based customers to self-identify and qualify at the point of sale and then take advantage of it and move into a product or service. And we think that will be actually over the long haul, something that makes for more continuity in our relationships with customers as it insulates them a little bit from economic cycles and some of the things that are going on, like higher inflation. On the infrastructure side, look, I'm optimistic. We haven't given any guidance on what we think that number will be. And I will tell you, frankly, timing-wise, this is a little bit out in the future right now. As you know, the maps are not going to be issued from the FCC until a little bit later this year. And until that happens, the money really can't start to flow at the state level. So we got to get the maps in place. We've got the procedural process being defined as to how the states will come back to the federal government and seeking the distribution of these funds. They will have to go through there. The state will have to go through their processes to do that. I expect that, that will start to occur into next year. Awards will probably start to materialize, maybe in some meaningful levels, in the middle part, latter part of next year. And then you have to go and build and ultimately bring these things online.  So you're not looking at these things creating what I would call material impact on the '22, '23 plans right now as it moves through the cycle. How much, we'll get a better idea once the rules are set. And each state is going to have authorship over their strategies and approaches. I've shared before that we're actively working with states trying to shape them in ways that we think are meaningful for our business and our good policy for each of the states. I would point out, there is no company that's building a 2 million connected locations of fiber in 6 months like we are. We are scaling in a way that nobody else is. We are deploying wireless infrastructure at a torrid pace. I think that makes us a good partner. I think at the end of the day, states do care about somebody who's reputable, that can execute, that has a mature supply chain and a scaled engine to go after, should make us very competitive for this money. And we intend to, through a combination of what we're doing with ACP and our operational prowess and our scale that we're demonstrating and the fact that we've got a product in the market that customers love. It's got the highest NPS out there. I think we should be a very qualified partner to work with government on that. And I'm optimistic that we can avail ourselves with some of that money. Operator : That question will come from David Barton with Bank of America. David Barton : I guess I wanted to talk about the second half free cash flow guidance, if you will, for $10 billion and the jumping-off point for 2023. I think, Pascal, you said the biggest moving part is going to be $3 billion less spend on equipment in the second half, which is -- which would not be normal, I think, just because it's a higher upgrade period. You've got the iPhone refresh. I was wondering if you could kind of explain why that's going to be such a big tailwind. I think the second question would be $2 billion less in CapEx in the second half. We've been expecting AT&T to kind of come with the C-band development and the Auction 110 Spectrum and kind of one big push. And so why is it that the CapEx is coming down even as that begins. And if I could, one last one is, obviously, the cash flow seems very sensitive to this 1 or 2 days lengthening billing cycle. Are we convinced that the billing cycle has linked in? Or should we be concerned that it's linked sitting as we look into the back part of the year? Pascal Desroches : Okay. Let me try hitting all of those. And obviously, John can chime in. First, look, the thing to keep in mind is the second -- we pay devices, for example, probably a quarter to 1.5 quarter after the sale has happened. So for Q2, as an example, we're paying for the last part of Q4 and Q1. So in Q -- for the back half of the year, it's going to be largely activity from the back half of Q2 and Q3. So the holiday sales and the upgrade season, we're going to pay for that in the first half of 2023. And so mechanically, we have really good visibility in terms of the payments that we are likely going to make in the back half of the year. But overall, given the strong growth we had in the first half of the year, our overall device payments for the year are higher than we anticipated, which candidly, this is a very good -- it's a very good situation because we think this is attractive growth, and we feel really good about it. As it relates to CapEx, our fiber build was front-end loaded for the year. Remember, last year, we had some supply chain disruptions. And it took us a while to ramp. We got good exit velocity and exiting 2021, and that continued. And in the first half of the year, we delivered 2 million locations passed. So we feel really good about that. In terms of our and deployment and the pace of that, nothing has changed. We said we were guided to $24 billion of capital. That remains the case. So we're not spending any more capital than we thought for the year. And remind me the last part of your question? John Stankey : Days outstanding movement. Pascal Desroches : Days sales outstanding. So in terms of DSOs, here's what we know. This is a trend that is relatively nascent. It is probably 6 weeks or so that we start to see an uptick in days sales outstanding. Is it a trend? Is it going to get worse? We don't know, but here's what we do know. We do know that, as John alluded to, in prior recessions, customers may have paid late but they paid us. So there's nothing to suggest given the mission-critical nature of our services that customers won't pay us because they're going to want to maintain connectivity. So in that regard, we think it is a timing issue. And I think in this macro environment, I'm not going to call whether it's going to get much, much worse than where we are today. But we're taking a prudent view and not assuming it's going to get better, given all the uncertainty. John Stankey : Dave, the only other thing I would add to what Pascal said is as you -- we obviously hit our 70 million POP coverage commitment that we made to you that was part of the capital plan for this year 6 months early. And as we told you, we'll be around that 100 million neighborhood as we get to the end of this year. I think it's probably intuitive to you. But just to remind you, the first 100 million POPs in wireless coverage are very different than the next 100 million POPs, just in terms of kind of capital intensity and what has to be done to make them happen on the number of physical sites you have to touch. So if you want to think about this, it would not be right to kind of straight-line level of activity and investment as you make your journey to covering most of the United States. And that will probably help you understand maybe some of the rate and pace of things as we move through the year. Operator : That question will come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Can you comment a little bit on your dividend policy going forward? Is it a priority to grow the dividend by various amounts? That would be great. And then on part of the business side, I think you commented earlier this year about exiting some lines of business that were really low to no margin. How is that going? And to what extent is that impacting the declines that we're seeing in the business line? John Stankey : Frank, look, we've been pretty clear on the dividend policy as to what we're doing. And the board ultimately makes this call and this decision. And as I've said before, we set this at what we think is an incredibly attractive return in the market right now. And I think we are still standing there relative to the yield on the stock. As I said, the Board will evaluate dividends, along with other choices in front of us to return to shareholders. As we've indicated, our priority right now is to get the balance sheet where we want it, which is a full rush and push to getting to 2.5x, and then we can evaluate what other options are at that point in time. And those other options will range from whether or not we want to do something on dividend policy or something we want to invest more back into the business or whether we want to push on some buybacks. And those decisions will be weighted at the time when we have those options in front of us and evaluate the market as to where it stands. Our intent is to ensure that we're returning a good and competitive dividend out to our shareholders, which we have today. And we'll continue to be mindful of that as we go forward and we see the stock price adjust in what occurs in the value of the business. On the ABS side, look, I think as you've heard, the repositioning of the asset is -- it's a multi-quarter. This set of processes and approach are backing away from lower-margin products is relatively straightforward. I say relatively because we can make the decision to do it at the front end. Obviously, in this customer base, we have contracts that sometimes extend for multiple years in a period of time, where we then have to kind of go through a wind-down and wrap-up cycle once we stop selling something. And we're in the middle of that occurring. But the process of choosing not to drive new sales at the front end has been a relatively straightforward set of decisions. And I feel like we're executing reasonably well around that piece of it. We have dropped the number of products we have in the market pretty demonstrably over the last 1.5 years. And we'll continue down that path. And I think it's that reduction in complexity that will allow us to then scale up what's essential to have a viable franchise moving forward in a robust and growing franchise moving forward, which is one centered on moving product that is on our owned and operated infrastructure. And what's right about our segment here that I want to stress is we report a little bit differently than some of our peers. We do not report a consolidated business entity in both wireless and wireline services. You should understand, a lot of our strength in the wireless business is coming from our success in our Enterprise business. It's coming from increases in the public sector, in our success of what we've done with FirstNet. It's coming from our success in penetrating deeper into our Enterprise accounts with wireless services. We're really pleased with the share gains that we've seen in Enterprise moving forward, where we believe we have the opportunities in the mid-market. And the low end of the market and the attractive part about that is it's a [2/4]. It's not only getting more transport on the fiber infrastructure we're deploying, but we are underpenetrated in the wireless space as we move into those accounts. So when we deploy fiber and we have an opportunity to talk to mid-market customers about putting more of their transport on AT&T, we also oftentimes get the opportunity to talk to them about moving their wireless account as well. And that's an attractive opportunity for us. It requires us to tune our distribution differently. That's a slower process. And we've been making progress around it. You heard Pascal talk about the growth that we're seeing in our Fiber products. We're seeing some progress in the wireless space in the mid-market, but we're not up to where we need to be yet. We will get there. We play very well in that space. Our brand plays very well in that space. We know how to sell product in that space, but it's getting the engine kind of hitting all at all 8 cylinders. It's going to take us couple more quarters than what we expected, but I'm optimistic we can get there. It's the right asset base. It's the right brand. We know how to approach these customers. And we will make that happen. Operator : That question will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : Two questions. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the wireline side of the business market? What are you replacing your legacy virtual private line networks with? The same thing with voice. Are you \u2013 I guess, are you retaining these customers? Do you have a product for them? Is it just a lower ARPU issue?  And then secondly, on the CapEx, we\u2019re hearing CapEx equipment costs, labor costs are up 10%, 15%. I know you gave your guidance out quite a while ago for next year. I guess how are you offsetting those price increases that we\u2019re hearing about out there in keeping your CapEx flat? John Stankey : Tim, so look, the move, as I just articulated, is we want people on owned and operated infrastructure. And so it is \u2013 as people migrate away from VPN \u2013 and we have a more dense fiber bases, we\u2019re selling more fundamental underlying transport, frankly, at higher speeds, and therefore, higher connection values in that segment of the market. And that\u2019s where our future is. We work with layering that on an SDN capability that aggregates that, and that is the replacement product for VPN. And we do very well in the market on that, although there is typically, in a network replacement, at the top end of the market, some trade down and total value when that occurs. That\u2019s why this move into the mid-market is so important to us, where we are typically underpenetrated because offsetting that trade down in the enterprise \u2013 top end of the enterprise space, where we are a sheer leader on VPN and have these complex networks, as we have some of that trade down and the migration on the technology side, market replacement in the mid-market is what offsets that and allows us to move the sector back to growth over time as we make that happen. And again, it\u2019s why this investment in fiber in our core business is so critical and important in repositioning our distribution to make that happen. The world for us moving forward is a data VPN-replacement world. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to make our bread and butter. Our play in voice is to penetrate more deeply into wireless in these spaces.  Generally speaking, when you look at what\u2019s happened on collaboration services, it\u2019s moved to other providers that are doing that kind of work. We want the underlying data infrastructure for those collaboration services to run on. And we want to sell more scaled wireless solutions on top of our transport services into these customers to extend our relationship with them. And I think, as I said just a moment to Frank\u2019s question, we\u2019re doing that fairly effectively. And that\u2019s what the future is and how we move forward on it. On the cost side, we\u2019re certainly seeing some pressures as we move through. We\u2019ve articulated that. We\u2019re able to navigate it better than a lot, as we\u2019ve shared with you previously. We have a lot of long-term contracts in place. I think those help us a lot. I won\u2019t tell you they entirely insulate us. We want our suppliers to be healthy. We pay attention to that. We have good, long-standing partnerships with our suppliers. And I will be candid. We have sat down with them. In some cases, even though not had to pay people more, I\u2019ve elected to pay people more because I think that makes for a healthier win-win relationship on things moving forward. And we are having to take some costs into our build and what we\u2019re doing. However, these are long-lived assets. And some increase in our build costs, for example, on putting fiber out there is not the end of the world for us. We\u2019ve shared with you a lot of data on the effectiveness of our build. We\u2019ve shared with you that when we did the original business case on these things, we\u2019re penetrating a lot more rapidly than we thought we would. That has a big impact on the overall return characteristics of this investment. That can overcome maybe some of those per-living unit cost increases. We really like the ARPU trends we\u2019re seeing. We really like the churn trends we\u2019re seeing. All those things still make us a really smart and important investment for our business. And I think it\u2019s a balancing act as we move through it. And as we\u2019ve said before, when you get the asset in the ground and ultimately work through multiple quarters of inflation, building it today is better than building it a year from today. And if it\u2019s a long-lived asset and it\u2019s an important product, ultimately, we\u2019ll probably see some accretion move into ARPUs over time. So I feel like we can manage through this reasonably well, given our scale, given our long-term relationships with folks and the importance and durability of the product over time. Tim Horan : Thank you. John Stankey : So folks, I really appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. And I know you got, from maybe hopefully the last time, a little extra work to do this quarter as we work through the disaggregation of discontinued operations and the like in results. And I\u2019m excited about finishing this in this quarter and now moving forward in a more consistent fashion. We made some hard moves that brought us to this moment that all acknowledge. But those hard moves were to, number one, give us the ability and the flexibility to invest heavily in this business; and to make sure that we could respond to what goes on in the environment economically, whether economic stress, rising interest rates, et cetera. And I would say I\u2019m really pleased, we\u2019re in this position for having made those decisions. And it\u2019s allowed us to do exactly what we intended to do, which is to think about how do we create a durable AT&T with a consistent machine that can deliver the right kind of subscription services for broadband moving forward. And I think we are doing that. We\u2019re building a world-class infrastructure, where we\u2019re doing that. You\u2019re seeing the momentum in the market that we\u2019re able to achieve. I view these customer relationships as durable customer relationships that are highly accretive and attractive.  And I will tell you that as I work with the team, 90 days in this business with the way we operate and the infrastructure we build is sometimes a bit like trying to land a plane on the top of a pin. And so when I think about the reality of what we\u2019re doing here, we want to look at it over the course of the year. And as the business has the right kind of momentum, and I\u2019ve got people doing their work, we continue to invest. We make sure we put the right things out there. And a 90-day cycle is not the end of the world in any way, shape or form. Hopefully, we\u2019ve given you the confidence that we understand what\u2019s going to occur in the balance of this year and that we\u2019re investing in a way that\u2019s going to return for shareholders in a fashion that, I think, we\u2019ll all be proud of moving forward. So thank you very much. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer. And we\u2019ll talk with you in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.  Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. And as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we shared our third quarter results, which, yet again, demonstrate our strong execution in delivering critical connectivity services to our customers.  Earlier this month, we saw just how vital these services truly are. In the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Ian, the ability to connect with others proved to be invaluable to so many people. And our teams were, yet again, some of the very first to arrive on the scene, working tirelessly for our customers. The effort they made, along with first responders, supported by FirstNet, to keep our network running in some of the hardest hit areas was nothing short of heroic. I'm really grateful for their sacrifices, and all of AT&T is proud of their efforts.  I'd also like to say thank you to our teams for their solid execution in deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum and building out best-in-class fiber-based access solutions. As you can see from our results, we continue to deliver strong customer growth on the back of our focused 5G and fiber strategy. The demand for fast and reliable 5G and fiber is at an all-time high, and our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy continues to resonate. In addition, as we begin to lap investments we need to optimize our networks, improve our distribution and transform our business, we're now seeing the benefits of our growth fall to the bottom line, as we suggested they would and as evidenced by accelerating adjusted EBITDA growth.  Let me dive in a bit. In Mobility, we posted another strong quarter of growth by adding 708,000 postpaid phone net adds. As I stated in prior quarters, our consistent results are being driven by an improved value proposition, better network experience and our ability to meet our customers where their needs are. We're creating efficiencies through our distribution, and acquisition costs are improving. This is helping us drive further gains in operating leverage.  This past quarter, our teams delivered across 3 key performance measurements : strong postpaid phone net adds, accelerating ARPU growth and higher Mobility EBITDA. In fact, the third quarter marked our highest wireless service revenue growth year-over-year in more than a decade, and we now expect to achieve wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of the 4.5% to 5% range. This is about 200 basis points higher than where we expected to land at the start of the year, thanks to continued net add strength and ARPU growth. Now let's jump to fiber, where we continue to invest in building out a premium network and deliver on our stated expectations for steady customer growth. The success of our strategy is evidenced by the fact that we just posted our 11th straight quarter with more than 200,000 fiber net adds, with 338,000 net adds this past quarter.  We're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets with what is the best wired Internet offering available. We're increasing share in our fiber footprint and converting more IP broadband Internet subscribers to fiber subscribers. This is driving favorable ARPU trends and profitable growth within our overall Consumer Wireline business. Ultimately, our fiber strategy is a long-term play, centered around a best-in-class network technology with a multi-decade lifespan. When others finally decide they need to upgrade their infrastructure, we will already be providing our customers with great service and sustainable technology. Simply put, where we have fiber, we win. And the numbers show we expect to keep winning.  So let's step back for a minute and take a look at what we've done so far this year across 3 quarters. We've achieved what we expect will be an industry best with more than 2.2 million postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, our teams are deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum quickly and efficiently, and the spectrum assets we're rolling out are performing even better than our high expectations.  As a result, we've achieved our already increased year-end target of 100 million mid-band 5G POPs and now expect to reach more than 130 million people by the end of the year, nearly double our expectations when we entered the year. This progress is benefiting our customers as well. In fact, since the start of the year, our already consistent download speeds have increased materially as a result of our mid-band deployment. We're also approaching 1 million AT&T Fiber net adds for the year, and we've added nearly 2.3 million fiber locations through 3 quarters to bring our total customer locations to 18.5 million. This keeps us on track to achieve our target of 30 million-plus locations by the end of 2025. In summary, I'm very happy with the strong, high-quality and durable customer adds, network enhancements and improving financial returns we're seeing across our twin growth engines of 5G and fiber.  Moving to our next priority. It's more important than ever that we be effective and efficient across our operations. We continue to have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year.  As I said earlier, we're beginning to see savings start to contribute to the bottom line. We're transforming our business as the world continues to face what feels like a period of uncertainty. Many of the economic trends that we spoke about at the start of the year and the assumptions that we've been operating under are now coming to fruition.  This is one reason why we focus so intently on reorienting our business, whether it was asset dispositions, investing in cost transformation or our proactive decision to address rising inflation through a measured pricing strategy. As a result, our balance sheet has improved, our network performance continues to get better, and we're now seeing some benefits to our profit trends. This is a direct result of acting when we did and how we did it.  Our third quarter results demonstrate that our business can deliver even against the challenging backdrop. The current environment is not easy to predict, but our flexibility affords us the ability to meet or surpass all of our financial commitments while investing in the best technology available.  Now turning to our capital allocation strategy. The long-term economic justification for our investments in 5G and fiber remains fundamentally sound, and we're continuing to invest through this cycle to support future growth. These investments will prove to be the foundation of AT&T over the next few decades.  We feel confident our approach will prove to be increasingly beneficial with each passing year as data demand and traffic continues to grow dramatically. Our strength and focus on core connectivity is helping us meet customers' needs, and we're growing mobility and fiber subscribers in a disciplined and profitable manner quarter after quarter after quarter.  This makes me very comfortable with our ability to continue improving the cash yields of our business going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was in line with our expectations despite higher third quarter capital investment spend, and we're on track to deliver on our previously stated $24 billion capital investment plan for the year.  At the same time, we hope this healthy free cash flow for the quarter gives you confidence in our ability to achieve our target for free cash flow in the $14 billion range for the year, a level that is more than ample to support our $8 billion dividend commitment. Before I turn this over to Pascal, allow me to finish with this.  Our results demonstrate that the strategy we put forward more than 2 years ago is the right strategy for not only the future of our business, but for the future of the communications industry. We're focused on creating sustainable and scalable businesses that drive a free cash flow flywheel for many years. We continue to hold ourselves accountable for earnings growth against our historic levels of investment, which you'll see through improved cash conversion moving forward. We're confident that the investments and choices we're making will benefit our customers and shareholders now and in the future, while also setting the stage for our next act as America's best broadband provider.  Let me now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on Slide 5. Our consistent Mobility strategy remains successful as we delivered 708,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. Since we began our transformation 9 quarters ago, we've delivered nearly 7 million postpaid phone net adds, along with improved ARPU.  Looking at AT&T Fiber. We totaled 338,000 net adds in the quarter. This marks our second best quarter ever. Our plan in Consumer Wireline remains centered on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that. Over the past 9 quarters, we've gone from 4.3 million AT&T Fiber subscribers to now approaching a subscriber base of 7 million. So we're really pleased with the momentum we have with customers in the marketplace across mobility and fiber.  Now let's move to our third quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 6. First, as a reminder, with the closing of the Warner Media transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present Warner Media and certain other divested businesses, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic as discontinued operations. Additionally, there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior year results also included DIRECTV for 1 month and other 2021 dispositions for a partial quarter. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis.  Comparative revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 3.1% or more than $900 million versus a year ago. This is largely driven by wireless revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues. This was partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline. Comparative adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 5% year-over-year as growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline in Mexico were partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline. We expect the year-over-year EBITDA trend lines to improve for the balance of the year as we continue to grow our wireless and fiber customer bases and lap 3G network shutdown costs and stepped-up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021.  Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.68. On a comparative stand-alone AT&T basis, adjusted EPS was $0.62 in the year ago quarter. The quarter also includes a recurring favorable impact of about $140 million to adjusted EPS from retirement/medical benefit plan change. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be $2.50 or higher.  Cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Capital investments of $6.8 billion was up $1.3 billion year-over-year, and we continue to expect capital investments in the $24 billion range for the year. Free cash flow was $3.8 billion. DIRECTV cash distributions were about $1 billion in the quarter. Overall, we remain on track to achieve or surpass all of our previously shared financial targets for the year.  Now let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues its strong subscriber momentum and positive profitability trends. Revenues were up 6%, with service revenues growing 5.6%, driven by subscriber growth.  Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.67, up $0.86 sequentially and 2.4% year-over-year. This continues to come in ahead of our expectations. This is largely a result of benefits from our targeted pricing actions, improved roaming trends and more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans.  With regard to EBITDA, we delivered our highest Mobility EBITDA ever. Year-over-year, Mobility EBITDA increased 5.5%, driven by wireless revenue growth. We remain confident that Mobility EBITDA growth will continue to accelerate through the balance of the year due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3G network shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021. So we're really happy with our Mobility performance, and our consistent strategy is yielding great results.  Now let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on Slide 8. Our fiber growth remains strong, and we continue to win share where we have fiber. Our total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter even with continued declines from nonfiber broadband services.  Broadband revenues grew 6.1% due to fiber revenue growth and higher broadband ARPU, driven by customer mix shift to fiber. Our fiber ARPU was $62.62, and we expect that to continue to improve as more customers roll off legacy promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs.  Looking forward, remember that seasonality in the fourth quarter typically results in lower industry net adds. We expect EBITDA growth to remain strong on a year-over-year basis for the balance of 2022. This will be driven by growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021.  Looking at Business Wireline. We continue to restructure and rationalize our portfolio with a focus on core connectivity where we have owners' economics. In this regard, we continue to grow our connectivity services revenue as both 5G and fiber offerings continue to perform well.  Our enterprise mobility momentum remains strong, with Business Wireless service revenue growth of 7.9% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base of 334,000. Additionally, we had about $100 million in revenue from intellectual property transaction in the quarter. This is about $80 million more than the prior year. For context, this is an action we've taken in the past when favorable opportunities arise.  Now I'd like to quickly touch on our capital allocation strategy. Overall, our priorities remain unchanged, and we're largely past the heavy lift of reorienting our company's focus on our core connectivity strengths. As a result, we've established a more sustainable financial structure that better positions us for the current environment. We also have enough flexibility to invest in our business while meeting our financial obligations. In the third quarter, the $3.8 billion in free cash flow we delivered was largely in line with our expectations. And given the expected timing of our capital investments, we feel good about our line of sight to achieving our free cash flow target in the $14 billion range for the year. We are very comfortable with our cash levels after paying our dividend commitment, and this should only increase in the future years as we expect cash conversion to improve from here.  Our results today have only further solidified our confidence that we will exit 2022 stronger than we entered the year. In fact, we continue to expect EBITDA growth and higher free cash flows in 2023. We also plan to continue to use excess cash after dividends to reduce debt with a goal of reaching a net debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2.5x. And as we typically do, we'll provide 2023 guidance when we share our fourth quarter results.  Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : I guess, first, Pascal, the free cash flow bridge to $14 billion, just to reiterate, help us think about that as we go into the fourth quarter. You need at least $6 billion, and you said CapEx, it sounds like it's coming down. That's a good part of it. And then as we think about next year, for what you can give us, how should we think about things like taxes, pension as well as the industry overall? And I know you don't want to update it, but given how much the world has changed, is that $20 billion free cash flow guide even relevant anymore? Pascal Desroches : Phil, I appreciate the question. Maybe let's start. With regard to the $14 billion for this year, the simple way to think about it, we delivered $3.8 billion this quarter. And that is when we spent $6.8 billion in capital. Next quarter, we reiterated our guide for the full year of $24 billion. So next quarter, that would suggest around $4.5 billion.  And so you do the simple math, that gets you exactly where you need to get to for the full year. And as a general matter as well, the fourth quarter -- the back half of the year, we always convert at a higher rate than the first half of the year. So all in all, great line of sight. In terms of next year, you mentioned the macros. That is the very reason why we are not providing updated guidance right now, and we're going to stick to our -- what we communicated last quarter in that we'll update you at year-end when we report our fourth quarter results.  With that said, as you heard from my prepared remarks, we expect EBITDA and cash to grow next -- free cash flow to grow next year. In fact, if we just look at this past quarter, we grew cash from continuing ops nearly 10%. So it's really strong growth -- organic growth from the business, and this is exactly what we anticipated coming into the year. What are the factors that are going to drive improved earnings and cash next year? Mobility. Our mobility business is performing much better than we expected coming into the year. Subscriber base is bigger than we anticipated, and ARPU trends are better.  Two, fiber. Again, fiber is performing really well. and the mix shift that we're seeing to fiber comes with higher profit margins, higher ARPU. So that's also expected -- Consumer Wireline is expected to grow next year. We should see some moderation in the overall Business Wireline trends because of the cost efforts that we are undertaking. And then you layer on top of that things like transformation savings, more broadly, starting to fall to the bottom line as our investments begin to have a peak and begin to dissipate over time.  So -- and lower interest is another factor to keep in mind as we delever. And then all that is going to be partially offset by higher cash taxes. Magnitude, I'd say, is consistent with what we've previously guided, and then slightly less DTV distributions.  All in all, we feel really good about the trajectory of the business. And when you look at an annual dividend commitment of $8 billion and a growing free cash flow, the model is working exactly as we anticipated. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Really, just sort of two here on fiber. The first is, it's great to see that the fiber net adds continue to gain momentum. You now have a larger fiber broadband subscriber base than nonfiber, but you haven't quite turned the corner sustainably yet on net positive broadband growth. And so I was hoping you can comment on how you see the path unfolding there. And do you just need a bigger fiber footprint to get there?  And then the follow-up on that question is, there was a report yesterday you're considering a potential fiber JV. I'm sure you're somewhat limited on what you can say. So the higher level question would be, your existing fiber build is being completely funded out of your cash flow from operations. So if you were looking to do something incremental, including with a partner, what kind of boxes would you have to check? Is this about speed or breadth or potentially something else? John Stankey : Brett, I appreciate the question. Certainly, a bigger fiber footprint allows us to improve our relative net add performance in broadband. I think the short answer to your question is, for the next several quarters, we'll be in this dance around, what I would call, at least on the subscriber counts, something close to near 0. But you ought to understand, as Pascal just indicated to you, our yields on fiber customers are, of course, much better than our copper customers. Combination of ARPU, churn characteristics and, frankly, the operating performance profile, which, I know you've observed that there's still room for our margin expansion in the Consumer Wireline business and that we should be looking at that relative to others in the industry.  And I think that's an accurate observation over time as we continue to scale the business, that we'll continue to improve profitability in it. But we still have several quarters of working through the dynamic of getting the legacy dynamics out of the business and focusing on the new infrastructure and the growth, and that's a journey we're committed to. And I think you're seeing that it's got strong economic promise as we move through that and continue to increase the size of the fiber base. I don't know that I could add a whole lot to you on your question about what we might think about in terms of doing other fiber builds that are out of our operating territory. First of all, I'm not going to acknowledge your comment specifically on some of the speculation that's shown up in the media. But I think I have shared most recently when I was in Arizona, and we were doing the work in Mesa, that we're evaluating it under many of the same sort of criteria and circumstances that we look at within our existing operating footprint.  Number one, can we go in and be the first fiber provider in that area? Two, do we believe it's a market where the brand is going to perform, and we'll get the rate and pace of penetration that we need to make an economic return on it? Three, can we build because of the dynamics around a particular municipality or area cost effectively and quickly with a relatively low overhead around that and get, what I would call, an operating scale in that geography that warrants the fixed cost infrastructure start-up? And then finally, do we think that there's some interplay in terms of having the asset and improving value in our wireless business as we operate in the area as well, and it marries into our distribution?  So to the extent that we found opportunities like that, that had as competitive returns is building in our region, I think the management team would have to evaluate those types of things and think about how it moves forward on them. And I would tell you, as I've indicated as well, that there will be some federal subsidy monies coming in, in places, and we should use that same set of criteria in that same model as we think about are there opportunities for us to pair our capital with possibly a public capital to open up opportunities that we might not have pursued otherwise. Operator : Our next to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : John, you opened your comments mentioning the world faced a period of uncertainty. You've been looking at that for a little while. It would be great if you could, and Pascal, update us on what you're seeing real time, both on the business side in terms of cutting back IT budgets, et cetera, and how that may evolve over the next few quarters as they deal with some of the stresses from inflation demand?  And then on the consumer side, obviously, you've called out the DSO issue last quarter. Good to hear the free cash flow reiterated this quarter. So perhaps you could update us on payment trends on bad debts and how we should think about churn here as your sort of pricing increases sort of mature going forward? John Stankey : Sure. Simon, why don't I start, and then Pascal is welcome to add any color on things I don't treat appropriately here. Look, on the business side, one is, I would tell you, I think the overriding dynamic in business is actually somewhat disconnected from the economy. And that is where we're in a secular change to cloud, and we're in a secular change to SDN.  And we've talked about that, and I've talked about it, and it's one of the reasons we're repositioning the business segment. And I think it's one of the reasons why us making sure that we are very careful in how we deploy owned and operated infrastructure that we can handle business workloads on is so important to us.  When we think about that dynamic, we actually play very well into an efficiency story for most -- established in large businesses. And it's a little bit of a painful transition. But over time, we'll get through it, and there'll be upside back in the core connectivity business on owned and operated infrastructure.  And that's simply the private networks that we had previously put out that were highly managed and highly architected are now moving to SDN-based technologies that are less managed but more bandwidth intensive. And we want to play into the uplift on putting more bandwidth-intensive infrastructure out there and selling those connections on owned and operated infrastructure. But the enterprise gets an efficiency benefit out of SDN because those less managed networks are not as costly to them on an aggregate basis.  And so I don't think the move from an economic perspective, if there are budgets that are strapped, is necessarily going to impact that transition. If it did anything, it might slow it down a bit. If it slowed it down, it would probably, frankly, be somewhat beneficial to us because margin structures on existing architectures are a little bit more attractive than on new infrastructure. But if ultimately people view it as an efficiency move and they want to run their businesses more efficiently, I think those trends are manifested in what you've seen over the last several years in the business. And I don't know that they will necessarily adjust as a result of that.  In the small business side, certainly, small business formation can be a hit during a down economic cycle. And I would expect that, in the business segment, that might be something that we ultimately see occur if there's a more moderate economic growth environment. But once again, unfortunately, for us, we're under-indexed in the small business segment. We're working to change that, and we're demonstrating progress in that regard. But my embedded base of subscribers in that area for what we do in advanced networking is not as strong in the fixed market as I might like it to be. So I don't know that we'll be overly impacted by that.  We could see some softness in the wireless space if, in fact, the economy ultimately did -- had a little bit harder sledding, moving forward that might moderate some wireless growth. But look, we've been getting more than our fair share in that segment. A lot of it's been driven out of FirstNet. I don't expect that trend didn't necessarily abate right now even in a down economic cycle.  Relative to some of your other questions on other economic characteristics and how it impacts the business, we've seen no change in DSO relative to last quarter. We are back to pre-pandemic levels. We characterized that for you last quarter. There hasn't been any additional slip. We, I think, accurately reflected to you in our guidance what the impact was going to be for the year.  Last quarter, that's still tracking consistently with what we articulated to you. We're seeing bad debt start to return back to pre-pandemic levels. Certainly, we'll have to watch that if the economy sours further. It tends to correlate to what occurs in the economy, but I see nothing right now that would suggest we're out of pattern on anything.  We certainly haven't done anything to change credit standards in our approaches and practices to managing credit quality. And I think you've seen how we performed in the past in that regard, where we have a high-quality base that allows us to kind of manage through those dynamics reasonably well if the economy goes one way or the other.  As I characterized earlier today in some of my public comments, churn is up a bit. It's not out of line with what we expected when we did the pricing changes. We were able to execute the pricing change in a way that we feel very comfortable with.  Most importantly, the vast majority of our customers are talking to us. They're making adjustments to their plans, moving them into higher-value plans while having higher ARPUs on them, return more value to the customer that allows them to be a stickier and longer-lived customer. We think that over the long haul is great.  On the margin, there has been some churn moving out that we expected. It's no greater than what we expected. It still makes the pricing changes accretive overall, and you certainly have seen that manifested in the numbers and the operations that have come forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Okay. Great. You guys have some real momentum in wireless in terms of subs, ARPU and now even margins. I mean, just give us a sense for the -- what kind of visibility you have that those 3 metrics continue to head in the right direction? And then as a follow-up, with the broadband fiber expansion and potentially the JV, if there's any change in the view on fixed wireless? Obviously, both Ryzen and T-Mobile are having a lot of success in selling that product. Just your view on that as we head into 2023. John Stankey : So John, I think our visibility is really good. I mean we run a subscription-based business. And as you know, those customer relationships tend to be pretty sticky relationships. And we have every ability to understand how we're bringing the customer in today and at what profitability level they're coming in. We understand the base and how the base is performing.  I think we have reasonable ways to look at some of the dynamics that change around things like roaming and have visibility toward those impacts and how they're going to work through. You just heard my commentary with Simon on some of the bigger drivers of profitability in the subscription business around churn and how we think about the dynamics associated with that. So when I look at our ability to kind of understand why we're getting operating momentum, we communicated to you at the beginning of the year that you should expect the back half story on this, and you're seeing the back half story. And now we're in the middle of the fourth quarter right now, we're obviously aware of what our numbers are right now. And I would say, we have confidence that we're going to be able to deliver those continued leverage dynamics that we talked about.  So I feel pretty good about our visibility on that subscription base. And we've built a quality subscription base and brought in quality customers that are now starting to give us that profitability lift as well as we have visibility into our cost structure and all the work that we've done around that. And as I've said since the beginning of the year that we would start to see some of that move to the bottom line as we stabilized our promotional position in the market, which, I think, you've seen us do, and we are still maintaining market momentum with that. And so I feel really good about it.  I don't know that anything has changed in fixed wireless. As I said repetitively that it has a place in our portfolio. That place is not broad-scale deployment in every operating territory and geography that we operate in. We -- the way I would characterize it, I'd rather take 1 million new fiber customers a year than 1 million new fixed wireless customers a quarter. The value equation of those 1 million fiber customers is a far superior value equation for the long haul for our shareholders.  And as a result of that, we're focused on ensuring that we can continue to grow our fiber footprint and bring on those high-value, sustainable durable relationships where we're able to have a network infrastructure that matches consumer consumption dynamics now and into the future. Fixed wireless will be that answer in a small number of geographies and applications and homes. It will not be to our entire nationwide base. And so investing shareholder money at the front end right now just to drive top line growth that I don't think is sustainable over a 3-, 4-, 5-year period is not the best use of my management team's time and the best use of our scarce capital. The best use of it is to put it against putting in durable infrastructure, continuing to bring on high-value wireless customers, build our wireless network to be really effective in the next set of applications that are going to be necessary to bring the promise of 5G to life as we start to see the dynamics of autonomy and vehicles emerge, some of the medical monitoring capabilities, private 5G that starts to work into the enterprise space.  We want our wireless network to be ready to service those workloads and do it in a pristine fashion because we think those revenues will come back with the kind of margin characteristics that we've typically operated the wireless business at. And so I feel really comfortable with our balance about that, and we'll use fixed wireless as we move into next year, where it's appropriate to use it, but it will not be broad scale.  Pascal, did I miss anything from your perspective there? Pascal Desroches : No. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess a couple, if I could. I guess the first question, Pascal, could you talk a little bit about how the interest rate environment is affecting the income statement? I guess, specifically, with respect to probably 2 items : one is the fixed versus floating; and the other would be how the net impact on the pensions is being affected in terms of discount rate for the PBO and then, obviously, the impact on returns to the portfolio. I guess the second piece I would ask would be on the wireless business. Obviously, the DISH wholesale arrangement was expected to be kind of a big contributor or a tailwind as we go into the year. Could you just talk about how, if at all, that's affected this year's performance to date and how we might expect that to evolve? Pascal Desroches : Okay. In terms of, first, the interest rate environment. One of the things that we did, Dave, over the last 2, 3 years is to really reconstruct our maturity towers and took advantage of historically low interest rates we were seeing coming out of the pandemic. As a result, right now, we have a debt tower -- a series of debt outstanding that are yielding around 4% on average, and 95% of it is fixed. And if you look at our maturities over the next several years, our free cash flows after dividend could largely handle those. In the instance that there are slightly higher towers, we can always roll on a short-term basis. But what we've done is we've reconstructed the way we are managing capital such that we can really continue to delever over the next several years without any meaningful need to go out to the market to raise debt. So that interest rate.  In terms of pension mark-to-market, in terms of pension, big picture from a cash standpoint. For the foreseeable future, let's talk the next decade, there's probably no need to fund the pension plan. Now with that said, there is, with the discount rate coming down, we've had some -- going up, we've had some big gains that we normalized out of our reported earnings. On a -- going through next year, I would expect higher pension expense because of the fact that now we have -- we're going to be discounting at higher interest rates.  But all in all, those are noncash pieces that, when we think about the long-term profile of operating this company, the fact -- what's most important to us is that there is no need to go fund the pension plan for the foreseeable future. And in terms of the DISH MVNO, it's not a meaningful contributor this year. We would anticipate, as we look out the next several years, it should ramp up. And we feel really good about the overall arrangement with this. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Just to dig in a little bit more to wireless. In the presentation, it was flagged that the business wireless service revenue grew 8% year-over-year, and I think the total was around 6%. So curious if you can unpack a bit more of the differences in trends that you're seeing between the business side of wireless and the consumer side of wireless?  And then as you're talking about the next stages of 5G and the opportunities, I was reading in the press release that you're flagging the success of IoT and connected device volumes. I'm curious if you can unpack that a little bit more in terms of, I think the automotive industry was one place you referenced in the release on success. Where are you seeing success in those verticals? And are you seeing any kind of inflection in the near to medium term where this B2B IoT opportunity could become more for AT&T and the industry? John Stankey : Sure, Mike. Let me see if I can get at your first question. I think I understand what you're looking for. If I don't quite hit this, then feel free to follow up with me. But look, there's no 2 businesses are alike is the first thing I'd tell you. And so as you look at kind of how you would characterize the relative profitability of a business subscriber coming on, a lot depends on which segment you're looking at.  I would tell you, generally speaking, our highest ARPU dynamics tend to occur in the consumer market when you kind of look at what we're able to do in family plan structures and what occurs there. Our growth in business, still highly profitable growth, but under some constructs like what we are able to do with FirstNet approaches. As you would expect, people who buy at larger volume tend to get better rates. And so you see that ultimately flow through, or maybe your ARPU dynamics around business are going to be a little bit less than what they might be in the consumer segment where people aren't able to buy at that kind of volume. Now having said that, you're looking at our overall ARPU trends, and you're seeing them improve and start to accrete and grow. And that's reflective of the fact that while we're doing very well in the business segment taking share, we're still growing ARPU in aggregate.  So despite those differences in the average ARPUs and what's occurring, we are still managing to grow that ARPU dynamic overall, and that's a healthy place for us to be right now. And as you've seen, our margin structure, relatively stable as we go through this quarter, and that's what's helping, of course, on some of the cash yields. On the IoT side, look, our mainstay of profitability in IoT comes in vehicles. That really hasn't changed. I don't expect in the near term, over the course of what I would call the guidance and planning cycle, that that's going to demonstrably change moving forward. I think there's a good opportunity for us to find the next level of growth in automotive.  And I think we, given our strong position in that market today, are well positioned to continue to work in that regard. And I think, when you think about each vehicle out there and the intensity of communication that's going to occur, there's an opportunity for growth in that space to build on. And that's one of the most attractive areas that we'll continue to push in.  Do I think that over time that in the spaces of manufacturing and medical devices that there's also an IoT opportunity to develop that -- as we get beyond what I would call the planning and guidance cycle that we gave you? I do. But I don't think those are going to be the kind of thing that as we characterize an update for you for 2023 that you're going to see those factor in, in any meaningful way in kind of business-to-business revenues that you look at and say that their pattern changes overall. Hopefully, that's responsive to your questions, Mike. If you want to refine the first one, feel free to follow up here. Michael Rollins : It's very helpful. And I was just thinking, just even on the top line service revenue side, with the business service revenue growth faster than the overall and then implicitly consumer, is that something that you would expect to continue where this business is just going to be a bigger contributor to the wireless business going forward? John Stankey : I do expect that's going to be the case because, as we shared with you, we have a number of dynamics going on and our distribution strategies that have driven that. And this is -- we keep saying it, I'm not sure it's fully being processed that our stance in the market and how we're offering in the market is not just driven by a promotional device stance. This is partly driven by -- we have managed to shift our distribution strategy and approach into the market, and we're doing better in these segments. And these are not sales that are necessarily being driven by people walking into stores, taking an upgrade on a device.  And that's why our overall profitability dynamics are shifting in the way they have been. And we've been able to give you some visibility to how that's occurring. And when we're successfully taking share in the public sector under things like FirstNet, and when there's affinity dynamics that start to work into that and the households of first responders, and when we're more effective at tuning our distribution in the mid part of the market for business than where we've historically been, you are going to see faster growth for us in the business segment. And I think the results speak for themselves on what we're able to bring in relative to the balance of the industry on that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : A couple, if I could. I mean, first, on the fiber side, we've seen penetration growth slow a little bit. Obviously, the absolute number keeps growing and accelerating every quarter sequentially. But then when we look at it in terms of penetration rate, I think it slowed a little bit versus what you were able to achieve last period. So it would be good to understand what the puts and takes there are and how we should expect that to evolve as we go forward. And then, I mean, I guess, an associated question is the nonfiber decline rate is also accelerating. And so how much of the growth that we are seeing in fiber is on account of transfers from maybe the nonfiber side to the fiber side? And lastly, just Pascal, on the $20 billion free cash flow guide for next year, could you give us a sense of what kind of math or variables are being assumed for that guidance in terms of potential recessions or the growth environment in general? John Stankey : So Kannan, let me take the first part of your question, and then I'll let Pascal do some cleanup here. So first of all, what you should expect is that, over the life cycle of a build -- and I think we've been pretty clear on giving you insights into this. Let's call it, the first 30% of penetration goes relatively quickly, and the next 20% takes a little bit longer. And so it would be natural that as we build, that when you kind of get yourself to a 30% penetration rate, you're going to see that curve start to slow down a bit, and that's to be expected.  I think the biggest change that's occurred in penetration is how quickly we're getting to the 20% level versus historic numbers. And as we shared with you previously, we've kind of doubled our pace to penetration on the front end of that curve. And I've also shared with you that if you look at a typical return characteristic cash flow analysis of the investment of fiber, there are effectively 3 big things that drive that return dynamic and how effective the returns are, one of which is rate of penetration.  And when we did the original assumptions on kind of our fiber business case, we had a much more ratable and deliberate ramp into that first 30% of subscribers in the business case. And now what we managed to do is we managed to effectively take a year off the cycle to get to the 20% mark. That is a huge impact on accelerating cash flows to the front end of the business case.  And it has a meaningful impact on the characterization of returns, even if you don't increase the ultimate assumption of what the terminal penetration is. And so I would tell you, we've already kind of had success in that regard. We've characterized that for you. But we've not made any assumptions at that once you hit that 30% level that the back end is going to go any faster.  And so I think you're going to see a degree of penetration slowdown as we kind of hit that 30%, and that's to be expected. It's been historic. And that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. It just takes a little bit longer to kind of get to what I would call as the market norm and kind of stability of how we expect shares to be allocated between the various players in the market. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of sense on that. We don't publicly disclose the transfer rates and kind of what's going on there, Kannan. But look, you've got enough public information that we shared with you. I think you pretty well can conclude that if we're turning in the kind of numbers we're turning in, that there's got to be a meaningful percentage of that total fiber increase number that's coming from competitors in order to deliver the number.  And we watch it. We track it closely. I think both are good, right? Because what we know that any customer we move from legacy or embedded infrastructure over to fiber becomes a new established long-term customer with us. They're not going anywhere once we get them on fiber.  But most importantly, we don't turn in the kind of numbers we communicated to you this quarter, unless we're doing something that's moving share in the market. And we all know where that share has to come from. It's coming from -- in almost all cases, the embedded cable provider. Pascal Desroches : And Kannan, on free cash flow, as I said earlier, we're not updating our guidance for 2023. But what I did say, we're over 3/4 of the way through this year. And based upon our view of where the macros and all the potential risk, we expect this business to grow both earnings and free cash next year and for all the reasons I articulated earlier on.  And in terms of just the broader macros, look, we're not immune to them. But these businesses are generally more resilient even in an economic stress situation. So overall, I mean, that's -- we'll give you an update next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : With your success with wireless, I just wanted to be clear how you're thinking about the promotional activity going forward. Any need to back off some of that promotional activity? You're clearly seeing good strong margin improvement without that. And then I had a follow-up question on the fiber JV. I can appreciate you not wanting to comment on the story, but conceptually, would you be open to some outside investment to possibly reach some of those areas of your territory that aren't necessarily economical with your own capital going forward? John Stankey : Frank, thanks for asking the quarterly question on what's sustainable. It was sustainable for another quarter, and that's been 2.5 years now. And I'll let you know next quarter if it's 2 years, 2.75 years. So I feel really comfortable with where we are. I think you're seeing the strategy play out. I look at where the market sits today, and I'll reiterate what I said earlier in the call. We're not the one out there with $1,000 for new iPhones right now.  We are at a different place than I believe both of our primary competitors. And I also characterized for you, you need to understand a lot of our growth is not coming from what we have as offers that we're communicating in the market. Mike's question is a really important question, looking at the consumer business mix.  And when we think about how we're spending our promotional dollars, I characterized for you in the Goldman conference that there's a lot of other aspects of promotion, how advertising gets done, how heavy you have to be to communicate your message.  If you're doing a more promotional stance, what you have to do in your channels to incent people to sell and change things, the formula and the mix we have is a very competitive formula and mix right now across consumer and business, across our mix of promotional strategies or distribution partners. And one should not just simply say, because the lead offer that's being communicated in mass advertising is x, ask whether or not that's sustainable. The question is, are our customer acquisition costs sustainable? You're seeing the profitability improvement. You're seeing the ARPU improvement, and I think that's a pretty sustainable equation.  I'm not going to comment on the fiber JV structure. I will make an observation, Frank. It's my duty to always keep my mind open to new ideas. It's my responsibility in running the business that if there's an opportunity for us to do something that's in our wheelhouse, that's in the strength of the capabilities that we have as a company, and it's core and foundational to our brand to try to ensure that we seize those opportunities and move forward on them. We certainly have a past practice. The wireless business was built with partners. I think you should understand and look back, and we've done that effectively in the past. And things that we've done, and we've done it in a responsible way for shareholders, and it's been a means for us to think differently about how footprint expansion can be done. We've certainly used that kind of an approach before. We understand how the approach works. I think about it in aspects to all kinds of elements of our business, and I've got to keep an open mind to those things moving forward. Operator : And that question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Walter Piecyk : John, when I look at postpaid, which is probably the prior focus on revenue for the company, you've increased revenue, or it's accelerated for the past 8 quarters. So I guess, when I look at the first part of that, you kind of referenced that in the last question, we were talking about how everyone was talking about the handset promotions. You saw very good subscriber growth, and that's sustained. And now when we look at the past year, it's been in part on price increases to some of the legacy plans.  So now you've got to this, whatever, where you're 6% growth in postpaid. If you just sustain that going forward, that will probably beat consensus. You probably don't need to sustain it, but when you look at '23, is it going to be a component of more price increases? Or do you think subscribers are going to help you for growth in?  And my second question, which is related, is part of the ARPU increase for others was bundling in Netflix or, for your case, HBO Max, that you cut, and I think in June 1 for new customers. Maybe that's been helping your profitability, I don't know, but is there an opportunity to repack some of these streaming services into your offers in order to get ARPU even higher? John Stankey : So well, I appreciate the question. First of all, I think it's important when you look at the disclosures and what we've given you for the quarter. As you know, there's always some onetime things that pop into a given quarter that drive the numbers. I think your overall characterization is accurate, which is we're improving the yields of the revenue growth and what falls to the bottom line on EBITDA.  I'm not going to suggest it's simply because we're going to get 6% revenue growth that we should expect that we're going to immediately get to 6% yields, but you've seen those yields improving each quarter. And we have a lot of confidence that, that's going to continue to occur, and it's consistent with the guidance that we've given moving through the balance of this year. And I think we have really good visibility for that improvement to happen. And there's a lot of factors that move into that, one of which is managing the cost structure more effectively.  In '23, look, I don't know exactly what the environment is going to be, and I'm not going to announce anything today in the market. We'll announce any of the changes we make in the market when it's time to change it. But when I look at the reality of the inflationary environment and understanding that in this kind of a rapid inflation environment, you need to manage the revenue side of the equation as well as you manage the cost side of the equation. The answer to that is yes. I think that's what a responsible management team does.  Exactly what lever we choose to pull will be an artifact of the environment we find ourselves in. But I can assure you, the team has sat down. And as we've looked at planning and as we prepare to give you guidance for the year, we'll ensure that we have the right options and levers available to us to adjust to that. And as I said, we've got to work both sides of that equation. But I'm not going to tell you today that -- a preannounced set of tactics or strategies around that, especially on things that are relative to how we price in the market.  On the content side, I don't think we've gotten any benefit, Walt, from content relative to the industry. We still have a lot of customers that get content bundled into their services, and we still view that as an important aspect of how we compete in the market. And as I think I shared last quarter, I would expect going forward that we'll have opportunities to incorporate content offerings in different ways into our portfolio.  We still view our relationship with Warner Bros., Discovery and HBO Max as being an important one, and it's been valuable and effective for us. But there's also others that could be worthwhile and beneficial to us. We're adjusting our strategies as we move into '23. I think you'll see some things adjust and change as we do that. So I think I'd say stay tuned.  I think you're going to see content and ancillary services continue to be part of the wireless bundle in the industry moving forward. I think we'll play in a prudent fashion in our overall promotional dynamic, as I said earlier, managing effectively as part of that overall cost structure. And it will allow us to do a number of flexible things now that we don't necessarily have a captive content engine, so to speak, under the umbrella of AT&T. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much for the question, Walt. And thank you, everyone, for your participation and interest in AT&T. With that, we'll conclude the call and look forward to connecting again post our fourth quarter results. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Special Services. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me today on the call are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and Happy New Year, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today, and I hope you enjoyed a restful and healthy holiday season. And at the conclusion of this call, I'm declaring the statute of limitations on this being the New Year has run out. I'll share upfront that our commentary is a bit longer than usual. However, we thought it was important to provide a bit more clarity on our business today, primarily our fiber strategy since we haven't had an opportunity to discuss our December Gigapower joint venture announcement. Still, we'll ensure we have enough time to get to most of your questions.  As I reflect on not only this past year, but the past 2.5 years, it's clear that our teams have worked diligently to refocus AT&T around a connectivity strategy that has simplified our company and positioned it for sustainable growth. Our results over the past 10 quarters demonstrate we are on our way to delivering the full promise of the strategy. We're operating a streamlined and return-focused business with an improved profit trajectory that's committed to generating sustained cash earnings growth while delivering an attractive dividend. Underpinning all of our actions is a deep desire to connect our customers with greater possibility through 5G and fiber. And importantly, we're assembling the right assets, talent and capital structure to offer an experience and value proposition that customers appreciate. Our fourth quarter results are the latest example of how our teams continue to consistently deliver for our customers. We finished 2022 with strong momentum in growing customer relationships. As you can see from our profitability trends, we're growing them in the right way. So let me highlight some of our progress. Let's start with wireless. We delivered 656,000 postpaid phone net adds in the fourth quarter and nearly 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds for the full year. And over the past 2.5 years, we've increased our postpaid phone base by nearly 7 million to 69.6 million subscribers which represents our best 10-quarter stretch of wireless growth in more than a decade. During the same 10 quarter time span, we've grown wireless service revenues, EBITDA and also increased our postpaid phone ARPU by nearly $1. And while others may have jumped the gun to claim that they were the only ones to reduce churn in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, we also lowered our fourth quarter postpaid and postpaid phone churn without offering richer promotions or free line giveaways. We consider this yet another data point highlighting that our comprehensive approach to improving the entire customer experience is working from our simplified go-to-market strategy, to our better network experience, to our focused market segmentation practices. On top of that, our growth was not only robust but profitable with 2022 being the most profitable year ever for our Mobility business. We expect profit growth to continue in 2023 as we benefit from the investments we've made in our business over the last 2.5 years. Our network teams have also consistently outpaced our mid-band 5G spectrum rollout objective. In fact, we now reach 150 million mid-band 5G POPs, more than double our initial 2022 year-end target. Our goal remains to deploy our spectrum efficiently and in a manner that supports traffic growth. In the markets where we have broadly deployed mid-band 5G, 25% of our traffic in these areas already takes advantage of our mid-band spectrum. Now let's move to fiber, where we build fiber, we continue to win. We had more than 1.2 million AT&T Fiber net adds last year. The fifth straight year we've totaled more than 1 million AT&T Fiber net adds. And after 2.9 million AT&T Fiber net adds over the last 2.5 years, we've now reached an inflection point where our fiber subscribers outnumber are non-fiber DSL subscribers. The financial benefits of our fiber focus are also becoming increasingly apparent as full year fiber revenue growth of nearly 29% has led to sustainable revenue and profit growth in our Consumer Wireline business. As we scale our fiber footprint, we also expect to drive margin expansion. In summary, we're enhancing and expanding our networks while extending our long runway for sustainable growth. And I'm very happy with the high quality and consistent customer adds we achieved last year. We've emphasized that our plan was to grow customer relationships in a thoughtful and responsible way grounded by an enhanced value proposition that resonated with customers. That's exactly what our teams have done quarter after quarter. In addition to growing customer relationships, we've executed some of the most challenging actions associated with repositioning our operations. We've doubled down on our cost transformation. We've now achieved more than $5 billion of our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target. In 2023, you can expect the benefits from these efforts to increasingly fall to the bottom line. In fact, you've already seen the benefits of this cost transformation beginning to translate into operating leverage despite inflationary pressures. Our teams did an excellent job implementing pricing actions and business efficiencies to offset continued inflationary impacts, impacts we anticipate will be with us in the near to midterm. Part of tapping into these efficiencies entails improving acquisition costs and further streamlining our operations and distribution. Another part entails rationalizing our wireline copper infrastructure and reinvesting those savings into fiber and wireless where we're seeing improving returns. As we look at our last priority, we also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow even with record levels of investment. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering an attractive dividend today and in the future, while also improving the credit quality of that dividend as we expect to increase our cash generation over time. We strengthened our balance sheet last year, reducing our net debt by about $24 billion. So as we close 2022, I'm proud of what the AT&T team accomplished despite a competitive market and challenging macro environment. Turning to 2023, what's our strategy? Well, it's simple. Do it again. What exactly does that mean? It means we're focused on the same three operational and business priorities we set in place 2.5 years ago.  As I've mentioned time and again, our North Star remains solely focused on becoming the best connectivity provider with 5G and fiber. We're confident we can achieve this because in wireless, we'll maintain our focus on building durable and sustainable customer growth in a rational, return-focused manner. Just as we've done over the past 10 quarters, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to selectively target underpenetrated areas of the consumer and business marketplace and improve the perception and execution of our value proposition. We also expect to continue our 5G expansion, reaching more than 200 million people with mid-band 5G by the end of 2023. In wired broadband, we have the nation's largest and fastest-growing fiber Internet, and we expect continued healthy subscriber growth as we grow our fiber footprint. As we keep expanding our subscriber base will drive efficiencies in everything we do. This includes consistently elevating our customer experience through the improved durability and reliability of our 5G and fiber networks. When we couple our evolving networks with further enhancements to our distribution and digital and self-service channels will make a competitive customer experience even more appealing. We expect to realize additional benefits from our consistent go-to-market strategy and lower cost structures. We also benefit from our improved brand perception, strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers. Additionally, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. We expect even more of these savings to fall to the bottom line as the year progresses. With that improved performance, we remain focused on further strengthening the balance sheet by using cash after dividends to reduce debt as we progress toward our target of a 2.5x range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our commitment to providing an attractive annual dividend also remains firm. As our CapEx is expected to moderate exiting this year, following the peak investment levels of 2022 and 2023, we expect the credit quality of our dividend to improve on the back of our higher free cash flow and improved financial flexibility. In summary, we feel confident that our growth and profit trends are sustainable despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. As I stated previously, we continue to expect that we will be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment where wireless industry growth is likely to return to more normalized levels. The resiliency of the services we provide are time-tested and only growing in importance. When you couple this resiliency with the investments we've made to our networks and proven go-to-market strategy, we're confident in our ability to navigate potential economic headwinds that may emerge and our improving financial flexibility only further strengthens that confidence. Now I'd like to take a moment to touch upon our fiber strategy by quickly level setting on how I'm thinking about the success we've had, our plans for the next few years and how we'll hold ourselves accountable. Similar to the early days of wireless, we consider fiber a multiyear opportunity that will transform the way consumers' and businesses' growing connectivity needs are met in the ensuing decade and beyond. For AT&T, we segment this opportunity into three distinct buckets based on the specific input parameters and return dynamics each one possesses. The first is our in-footprint build where we can take advantage of our existing infrastructure, deep insights on both the customer base and competitive landscape and our market presence in order to take share and deliver attractive returns. We believe our performance over the last few years supports the wisdom of allocating our capital to these opportunities with sustainable and solid return characteristics. As we stated previously, we currently size this opportunity is passing 30 million-plus consumer and business locations within our existing wireline footprint by the end of 2025. We finished last year with approximately 24 million fiber locations passed, including businesses, of which more than 22 million locations are sellable, which we define as our ability to serve. Our build to these locations is providing great returns, as you can see from our growing fiber revenues and ARPUs. As a general rule, about 5% of consumer locations passed may not be immediately sellable, primarily due to timing factors such as building access, construction or vacancies. Over time, we expect more of this inventory to become addressable for sale. We remain on track to reach our target of 30 million plus passed locations by the end of 2025. The simple math would suggest 2 million to 2.5 million consumer and business locations passed annually moving forward. As we previously shared, build targets will vary quarter-to-quarter in any given year based on how the market is evolving.  The second bucket is availing ourselves of partnership opportunities to not only expand but also accelerate our coverage in excess of that 30 million-plus location target. This is where our recent Gigapower joint venture announcement with a BlackRock infrastructure fund resides. While this deal is not yet closed, we're very excited about the expected benefit. Through this endeavor, Gigapower plans to use a best-in-class operating team to deploy fiber to an initial 1.5 million locations, and I would expect that number to grow over time. This innovative risk-sharing collaboration will allow us to prove out the viability of a different investment thesis that expanding our fiber reach not only benefits our fiber business, but also our mobile penetration rates. But what makes me most enthusiastic about this endeavor is that we believe Gigapower provides us long-term financial flexibility and strategic optionality and what we believe is the definitive access technology for decades to come, all while sustaining near-term financial and shareholder commitments. If I were to draw parallel to this partnership approach, I'm reminded the early days of wireless where the race to grow footprint was somewhat time-bound and facilitated by a similar approach ultimately culminating in today's national networks. The last bucket is framed by opportunities to connect people who previously did not have access to best-in-class technologies through broadband stimulus and BEAD funding. As I shared before, we truly believe that connectivity is a bridge to possibility in helping close the digital divide by focusing on access to affordable high-speed Internet is a top priority of AT&T. The intent of these government programs is to provide the necessary funding and support to allow both AT&T and the broader service provider community that means to invest alongside the government at the levels needed to achieve the end state of a better connected America. As the year progresses, we expect to gain more clarity around additional opportunities that exist, none of which are included in the 30 million plus fiber location target I mentioned. As we compete for the subsidy, we'll bring our operational and market experience to compete for contracts in a disciplined manner. In doing so, we may be the only participant that has the ability to bid as part of an embedded wireline operation, a scaled national wireless provider and Gigapower may participate as a focused and flexible commercial open access wireline fiber network. We think this will prove to be a winning combination in pursuit of attractive growth. The bottom line is this. Our commitment to fiber is at the core of our strategy. In footprint, we're on track to deliver our 30 million plus location commitment and we're building the strategic and financial capabilities to take advantage of further opportunities as they emerge. To wrap up, regardless of what transpires in the macroeconomy in the year ahead, we remain confident in the resiliency of the services our customers depend on in their daily lives. I believe our plan for the year rings true to who we are at our core. For almost 150 years, AT&T has invested heavily into connecting our country. And in the process of doing so, we provided a spark for innovation that connects people to greater possibility. This year, we'll continue to honor this heritage by significantly investing in best-in-class technology to build on a foundation for the future of our country's evolving connectivity needs, needs that we expect to grow significantly in the coming years. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Since John already discussed the great momentum we have this past year in growing our customer base in 5G and fiber, I'd like to start by taking a look at our fourth quarter financial summary on Slide 8. First, as a reminder, with the close of the WarnerMedia transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present WarnerMedia and certain other divested businesses as discontinued operations. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis. For the fourth quarter, revenues were up nearly 1%. On a comparative basis, revenues for the full year were up around 2%, largely driven by wireless service revenue and, to a lesser extent, broadband and Mexico. This was partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline. Adjusted EBITDA was up about 8% for the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was up around 3.5% on a comparative basis as growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline and Mexico were partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.61, up about 9% for the quarter primarily due to strong organic growth in Mobility and lower interest and benefit-related expenses. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.57 and I should note that we've taken a $24.8 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in conjunction with our annual goodwill assessment, primarily due to increases in discount rates associated with the overall rise in interest rates. We also took a noncash charge of $1.4 billion to abandon certain conduit assets related to the ongoing rationalization of our copper network. Free cash flow for the quarter was $6.1 billion, including about $800 million in DIRECTV distributions. This is an improvement of $780 million year-over-year, even with a $1 billion lower distribution from DIRECTV and $500 million less in FirstNet capital reimbursements. We also delivered on our revised full year guidance with free cash flow of $14.1 billion for the year.  Cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.3 billion for the quarter, up $2.3 billion year-over-year. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $4.2 billion with capital investments of $4.7 billion. Full year capital investment marked an all-time high at $24.3 billion as we continue to make record investments in 5G and fiber. Now let's look at our Mobility segment operating results on Slide 9. For the fifth consecutive year, our Mobility business grew both revenues and EBITDA. Revenues were up 1.7% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Service revenues were up more than 5% for both the quarter and the year, driven by continued subscriber growth. This exceeds the raised annual guidance we provided to you last quarter. Mobility EBITDA was up about $740 million or more than 10% for the quarter, driven by growth in service revenues, transformation savings and the absence of 3G network shutdown costs versus the fourth quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by higher bad debt levels. For the full year, Mobility EBITDA grew nearly 4%. Even as competitors introduce richer promotional offers during the holiday seasons, our consistent go-to-market approach once again drove our results. This gives us confidence that we have the right formula and structure in place to continue to grow customers, service revenues and EBITDA at a healthy clip this year. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.43, up $1.37 or 2.5% year-over-year. ARPU growth continues to come in ahead of our expectation and largely reflects our targeted pricing actions customers trading up to higher price unlimited plans and improved roaming trends. As John previously mentioned, postpaid phone churn of 0.84% for the quarter declined year-over-year even as we were less promotional compared to our peers. We believe that this decline is reflective of our improved customer value proposition. In prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% driven by Cricket phone churn that was substantially lower than 3%. While we believe industry wireless subscriber volumes will continue to pace towards normalized levels this year, we also expect our consistent go-to-market strategy to help us deliver strong relative performance and ongoing customer growth. Now let's move to Consumer and Business Wireline results, which are on Slide 10. Let's start with Consumer Wireline. As John mentioned, our fiber customer growth and network expansion continue. And wherever we have fiber, we win share. We added 280,000 fiber customers even in a seasonally slow fourth quarter that was impacted by lower year-over-year household move activities and challenging December weather conditions. The increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber drove strong broadband results, and we expect these trends to continue. Broadband revenues grew more than 7% year-over-year due to fiber subscriber growth and higher ARPU from the mix shift to fiber. Fiber ARPU was $64.82, up $2.20 sequentially with intake ARPU now approaching $70. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew over 20% for the quarter and nearly 10% for the full year due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings. Turning to Business Wirelines. EBITDA was relatively flat for the quarter due to $90 million in intellectual property transaction revenues and ongoing transformation savings as we continue to rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. In fact, margins were up 110 basis points year-over-year, thanks to our transformation process. This rationalization process will continue in 2023 as we remain focused on the opportunities that our 5G and fiber expansion create in the small and midsized business category. Our Business Solution wireless services revenue grew more than 7%. This is very impressive given the fact that we already have the second largest share in are growing faster than our peers. FirstNet wireless connections grew by 377,000 sequentially. Now let's move to Slide 11 for our 2023 financial guidance. Let me walk you through how we're thinking about operating expectations for 2023. First, we expect to continue to grow Mobility subscribers against a return to a more normalized industry growth. We also expect continued benefits from a larger subscriber base and improving ARPUs. This should result in wireless service revenue growth of 4% plus for the full year. For broadband, we expect revenue increases of 5% plus reflecting a higher mix shift to fiber with improving ARPUs partially offset by continued legacy revenue declines. Overall, we expect to grow total revenues next year. However, as you all know, variability in equipment revenues driven by industry volumes could be a factor on consolidated top line trends as we think about EBITDA trends in 2023. We expect to grow Mobility EBITDA mid-single digits as our disciplined approach helps us grow our valuable subscriber base. In Business Wireline, we expect EBITDA to be down high single digits due to continued declines in legacy products, partially offset by incremental cost savings and increased fiber-based revenues. As you consider the first quarter for Business Wireline, it's worth noting that 2022 included a onetime incentive compensation benefit that will impact year-over-year comparisons. In Consumer Wireline, we expect to grow EBITDA in the mid-single-digit range, plus or minus, due to continued growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by continued declines in legacy copper subscribers. We expect to benefit from ongoing corporate cost reductions. Altogether, this yields consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus for the full year. When you think about adjusted EPS calculations, note that our guidance reflects nearly $0.20 on per share of headwinds associated with noncash pension costs related to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent, lower spectrum interest capitalization. Importantly, we have no need to fund our pension plans for the foreseeable future. We also expect to incur more than $0.05 of noncash headwinds related to a higher effective tax rate of around 23% to 24%. Combined, these headwinds aggregate to about $0.25 year-over-year. Normalizing for these noncash items, our guidance would imply adjusted growth consistent with our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA. Given these assumptions, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.45 range. We also expect adjusted equity income from DIRECTV to be about $3 billion for the year versus $3.4 billion in 2022. Here's what to consider when looking at our free cash flows for 2023. First, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus. Next, expect cash interest to be down about $500 million. Assume your cash taxes will be higher in 2023 versus 2022 to the tune of about $1 billion. And expected cash distributions from DIRECTV should be down about $1 billion. We continue to expect that 2022 and 2023 will be our peak investment year. So capital investment is expected to be consistent with 2022 levels. We also expect about of $2 billion of working capital improvements, largely from lower deferrals and higher noncash amortization of deferred acquisition costs. As we mentioned earlier, we expect a more normalized industry growth volume which is expected to help working capital as well. When you combine all these factors, you get to a free cash flow expectation of $16 billion or better. This is about twice as much as our current annualized dividend and more than enough to cover other commitments. Similar to last year, we expect greater free cash flow generation in the back half of the year based on higher capital investment levels and device payments in the first half of the year as well as the timing of the annual incentive compensation payout. We will use our free cash flows to pay out our dividend and to pay down debt as we continue to progress towards our target of 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which we anticipate will take place in early 2025. And lastly, the guidance we provided to you is based on our current reporting. We expect our segment reporting in 2023 will remain the same as last year. However, I'd like to note that we no longer plan to record prior service credit benefits to the individual business segments with a corporate elimination. Instead, it will only be recorded in other income. Overall, we are confident in our plan for the year. And as John mentioned, it takes into account our expectations for a more normalized industry growth backdrop against continued challenges in the macro environment. Our confidence is underscored by the resiliency of the services we offer, the consistent strength of our go-to-market strategy, our ongoing momentum in core connectivity and most importantly, our team's unwavering commitment to deliver best-in-class services to consumers and businesses alike. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : I think I'll start off with a follow-up here on the outlook that you provided. I appreciate some of the color that Pascal provided about the different operating segments. Maybe at a higher level, could you give us a sense as to what you mean by a more difficult operating environment? In other words, to what extent does the outlook for this year anticipate maybe a recession or ongoing inflationary pressures? And then I imagine one of the questions we\u2019ll be getting today are, what are some of the key swing factors? And so if we were to use your adjusted EBITDA guidance as an example, what's the scenario that gets you to 3% growth and what could be the swing factors that might take that into the or higher category? John Stankey : Hi, Brett. Let me go ahead, and I'll start and then Pascal can jump in. So first of all, look at the foundation of what we're telling you is we've been I think, very conservative and thoughtful in the guidance we pulled together. It is a tough environment to predict. There's a lot of geopolitical things going on that I think anybody would have a hard time seeing and do a crystal ball on, and that's probably the most difficult wildcard that I think we've tried to take a conservative stance of what we see in the economy today and what the foundation that's rested on is. We know that the services that we provide to customers are pretty resilient even during more challenged economic times. And so we have a reasonably high confidence level that our customers are going to continue to want to use the product and pay us for it.  I think if you go back and look at my public comments probably over a year ago, I've had a relatively conservative view of where I thought the economy was going to go. I've been fairly vocal that I think inflation is a tough thing to have a healthy economic environment and that's good for everybody and it creates some challenges in places. And ultimately, a lot of that came to pass. The good news is I think we're through the worst of it, and we see it easy. But as you heard from my comments, we've expected that we're going to continue dealing with some of that pressure as we move through this year. So we don't have an outlook that says that we've solved the problem. We have an outlook that says we're going to continue to deal with pressures that are hitting some of our line items economically that we've got to account for and things like energy and some of the continued wage and employment pressures that we've had to deal with that will carry through and we have some longer-term contracts that didn't come up during the last year that we know are going to hit us this year in renewals that we have to factor into that. And I think we've tried to do the best we can around it. I see the economy being relatively stable right now. We're not seeing anything that's causing us to be extremely concerned about it. But what happens later in the year, who knows. The point we've made is we've kind of assumed that we're not going to be in a robust growth environment as we make our way through the year. And I would tell you if you're asking kind of what the swing factors are, I think the swing factor, frankly, is if there's some kind of a geopolitical disruption that's something significant that none of us anticipated or that we hope would never happen, it creates a disruptive event. That's probably the thing I'd look at and say, I couldn't predict it. I couldn't plan for it, and that's going to be the issue that we have to deal with, that just pops up and isn't going to be just an AT&T issue. Pascal Desroches : Yes. Brett, the only other thing I would add is, look, we've assumed in our outlook a more normalized industry growth environment. So to the extent it's more than that or less than that, that could be a swing factor. But the thing that I think is important, and I said this in my comments there is, whatever the environment is, we expect to perform relatively well versus the peer set. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups on capital uses. Pascal, you may have said this in your remarks, but what's driving the $2 billion in working capital savings this year? And what are your confidence behind that? And then could you remind us on the working -- on the CapEx side, obviously, $24 billion again this year. But just what was the longer term sort of view? When can we expect that to start to come down? And what do you guys think of as a more normalized sort of CapEx, especially given what you have now with Gigapower and all the fiber initiatives? Pascal Desroches : Sure thing, John. Here is the way I think about the $2 billion that I flagged in our guidance for 2023. The last several years, we've been growing our subscribers in wireless with that came some upfront acquisition costs. We've said for a while we expect that to level out in 2023. And so once you have that leveling out, we are no longer going to be spending more each and every year than the prior year in acquisitions. So that leveling out, there is assets that are on the books associated with the deferred acquisition costs of those subscribers. That's going to be amortized we have great visibility into that amortization, and that's obviously noncash because we spent the cash in the prior year. So that we have very good visibility to. And look, if we grow more than last year in terms of wireless subscribers, that could be a swing factor, but I don't anticipate that. John Hodulik : Got it. And then the CapEx? Pascal Desroches : CapEx, the thing to keep in mind is we plan to be at peak levels in '22 and '23 because of the significant contributions that we are getting from DIRECTV in '22 and '23's CapEx is fairly meaningful amounts for spectrum deployment and transformation that will begin to moderate as we exit this year. We haven't updated the guide we provided at Investor Day, but clearly, we expect to trend down towards more normalized capital intensity as we exit this year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick : Turning to fiber. Gigapower was a great announcement, but a little smaller than we had expected. John, how do you think about the 1.5 million versus the potential of that venture or for others in that model? And your own on-balance sheet fiber construction of -- I think you said $2 million to $2.5 million annually. It seems like a slower pace than we had been discussing. Is there anything changing there?  And then finally, just to John's question, one quick clarification on the free cash flow. Pascal, is that working capital going to contribute $2 billion to free cash flow in '23? Or is it just offsetting what had been a $2 billion drag, I think, in '22? John Stankey : Phil. So first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, I view the fiber portfolio as that, a portfolio. It's a portfolio of options for us to look at where the return characteristics are most optimal on how we deploy capital around that. And I'm trying to be pretty overt in my commentary to all of you that we understand that we need to be very disciplined in demonstrating to all of you that each of those portfolio decisions and how we put capital against that is, in fact, driving acceptable returns. I'm very mindful of the fact that the Gigapower announcement is a model that the investor base is unfamiliar with. This is something different and something new. And I want to be very sensitive to the fact, just like we did when we were deploying in-region fiber and stepping up our investments. I've tried to be transparent with all of you around what our progress has been on the key drivers of the economic return of that investment. We've been sharing pretty aggressively things with you like ARPUs and penetration rates and a variety of other things that give you the confidence that in fact, that that's a sustainable, smart long-term investment. This new Gigapower model is a bit different. And I think it would be normal for any of you to look at it and say, gee, it's going to return at the same level. And so to demonstrate to you that I'm serious about ensuring that every incremental investment decision we make in this look, 1.5 million homes, you may say, well, that's not a lot. It's over $1 billion of investment to be able to go do this. We set up this first tranche to be able to come back to you over the course of 18 months and give you information that raises your confidence and in fact, we are driving the returns on this in the way that we anticipate them to be attractive and the management team that has been put in place and how the partnership is set up is intended to do exactly that. We will be in the market very, very soon right after the announcement. I intend to have 12 months of penetration information that I can bring back to you. And you can bet that when we're successful doing this and we demonstrate to you that we have the numbers to back it up that it won't necessarily still be 1.5 million. I would also tell you, I want to be thoughtful about, as I've made the comment what is it that we should own and operate 100% to ourselves and what we want to do within the partnership, just like we might have done when we were building wireless infrastructure a couple of decades ago. And if we hit the ball out of the park and things are great, we may choose to do some of this in-house and on our own and not necessarily subjected to a partnership. On the other hand, if we need more scale and we need to move faster, we have a vehicle now that's set up that we can move very quickly to increase the amount of funding and the amount of capacity that's in that entity to take advantage of that. And so we're going to have data that we can come back to you with, and we'll, I think, do the right thing and try to make sure that you're moving along with us every step of the way. And I just see this as another tool that gives me a lot of flexibility and a lot of options.  Relative to the in-region fiber side of things, as I said, I'm looking for a portfolio of returns. And what I tried to stress in my opening remarks is, I'm giving you a characterization right now of what we think are high-return options within the 30 million passings that we committed to and what that looks like, and I've tried to clarify because I know some of you have been trying to do the math on it. But we have these other options now. I want to balance out what I think the return characteristics will be through the Gigapower initiative and we are going to now see some volume and capacity coming in out of region -- or excuse me, out of the 30 million build that will be subject to BEAD funding. And some of that subsidy may have a very different return characteristics than some of the stuff we're doing organically in region right now. And I want to have options open to understand that and look at that aspect of the portfolio as well. And I think we'll get clarity on that is on the end of the third quarter of this year that we start to see where we're successful in bidding for that money, how much it is, what kind of a build line do we put on the business in terms of having to add capacity to get the bill accomplished and how does it fit into the kind of operating territories that we think set us up for a geography and a footprint that's intelligent for us to operate moving forward. So that's kind of how I think about it in aggregate, and I'll let Pascal pick up your question on the free cash flow clarification. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Phil, the simple way I think about the majority of the $2 billion is this. We have deferred acquisition cost that's on the books where the cash went out in prior years. That amortization -- it's going to continue to be amortized against EBITDA in 2023. That is noncash expenses burdening. So when you -- just the sheer mechanics of adding that back to our free -- to our EBITDA will elevate the cash EBITDA that the business produces. Phil Cusick : John, if I can follow up on one. Start to be a split. Do you look at Gigapower and BEAD spending as alternative places to spend your capital and effectively now slowing the organic pace to get to that 30 million? John Stankey : I've given you the pace of how we get to the 30 million. And so I don't see that changing. I think we're committed to what I just articulated to you. So if you're asking am I going to see -- am I going to come back and give you an incremental revision of that 30 million to substitute? No. Pascal Desroches : But to be clear, Phil, this -- the BEAD money and the Gigapower are incremental to the 30 million. John Stankey : Yes, if that's your question, 100%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. If I could just stay on the broadband theme, if I could. Perhaps I think you talked perhaps about providing extra color on the financial construct of the BlackRock JV? Are you contributing any capital? Any assets how exactly should we expect that to flow through the financials? And John, on the beat, perhaps you just give us a reflection on the status of the process, the timing, how this is going to play out. I think there's been a lot of concerns about delays, the mapping process, the challenges and also some of the state broadband offices maybe not being ready to stand this up. So how do you see this evolving? And when do you think you can actually get shovels in the ground to get know what funding been awarded? And then just finally, getting to 30 million locations is great. What about the prebuilding with fiber with fixed wireless in some of those locations. I think you've talked about that. And how does fixed wireless play into some of that other 30 million plus locations that won't be getting fiber in the near term? John Stankey : Sure. So Simon, I'll be -- I've got to be careful about how much the partnership. It's a partnership structure, it's an entirely separate partnership structure, so you shouldn't expect to see any of the financials pull-through on a balance sheet structure for us, you should expect it to come in is investment income. We'll give you characterizations of the success of that and as it carries forward and you should think about this as both partners carrying equal weight in the execution of the entity. I think that probably gives you a good enough sense of how it carries through. And if you have something else you want to push on, I can try to give you a little more color. The BEAD timing, my point of view is I think there is -- there's been enough information put out there right now. We're going to go through a clarification cycle on the first set of data. I think that's moving along at a reasonably good cliff right now. And I think, frankly, the bigger states, those that have a more robust staffing capability are being pretty prompt and aggressive in working through getting that data set squared away. I would agree with you that there's going to be some states that are maybe a little bit slower than others, but my gut is when you're thinking about kind of the 80-20 rule, the bigger states, they're going to have the bulk of the funding are pretty zoned in on this, and they're moving pretty aggressively to get the process underway. And while there may be some smaller states that take a little bit longer to get their act together or are waiting to see how models develop in some of the more lead states that have bigger staffs to consider these things and then kind of be fast followers. I don't think that's going to inhibit some of the more aggressive states and being in the process and us being in a situation where in the third quarter, there's going to be monies starting to flow down from the Federal government and being turned back to the states for execution. So I don't think you're going to see any substantial shovels on the ground and certainly, customers being served in any substantial way this year. But I do think you're going to see projects and monies awarded before we exit this year, and you will see those volumes start to come online as we move into periods of 2024, and I expect that those will be concentrated in some of the bigger states that have more robust staff that can move through this fairly quickly. And pretty much have a view of how they want to go about doing this. They're just trying to get the data to fit into the process. As I've said before, we view fixed wireless as being a tool in the toolbox that we can use to deal with opportunities in areas that are less densely populated. We'll have our next rendition of the product in the market this year. There will be places where we view it as being an acceptable substitute for fiber deployment. They tend to be -- they are going to be less densely populated areas where it makes sense to do that. We have a plan as to how we want to test our assumptions around that. We will deploy and take advantage of that. I think it can have an opportunity to help us on some of the long-standing hybrid fiber copper base that we have that maybe has some speed challenges, and it will probably help us manage some of the churn characteristics associated with that, and I would expect to use it in that case. And then I would also add, look, there's a lot of businesses that maybe aren't in those less densely populated areas where this will be a perfectly acceptable and strong product, given the nature of how their business runs and what they need for their daily data needs and service needs. And so I do expect that we're going to have an opportunity to complement some of our strength in wireless distribution into the business market to provide a more robust fixed broadband alternative, fixed wireless broadband alternative to those customers, and bundle and package it in where it makes sense. Pascal Desroches : Simon, one other point on the capital structure for the JV to consider is that we do expect it to carry a meaningful amount of debt funding as well. Simon Flannery : Okay. Great. And are you contributing anything to it? Any capital, any assets? Yes. John Stankey : We have contributed some into the partnership. The reason you're going to see it get off the ground as quickly as it will and bring its first customers on in relatively short orders because while we have been structuring and negotiating this, we've been doing a fair amount of work in parallel quietly. And so the partnership, as we've indicated, is already structured with the management team that's in place that has been doing a lot of work on the offer that knows the markets we're going to be in that has infrastructure and system setup that they can be ready to go on. And I think this is probably one of the things our partner found attractive about this. It's a first-class management team with a lot of capabilities behind it, and we will take some credit for the contribution of that work that we've done within the scope of this year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess first, I just wanted to go back to the notion of wireless postpaid phone market \"normalizing.\" I think a lot of people look at the relatively high correlation between the substantial step-up that we've had in the industry to roughly 9 million postpaid phone nets a year for the last couple of years and AT&T's kind of resuscitated growth, as John pointed out, over the last 10 quarters. And as such, when people consider the industry \"normalizing,\" there's a pension out there, I think, to disproportionately assume that whatever amount of tide comes out on industry growth will be disproportionately allocated to AT&T because it disproportionately benefited over the last couple of years. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about that and whether you think that's realistic and that informs some of your working capital benefits that inform the cash flow or whether you think that, that's wrong and that you can kind of -- if there is a tide that goes out, it's more pro rata across the industry? That's number one. And then number two, John, you touched on something in the prepared remarks that we haven't talked about a lot here in the U.S., largely because we haven't been moving in this direction until you guys really started this fiber initiative, which is copper decommissioning. And for instance, in markets like Canada, it's a huge topic where they've widely overbuilt their copper plant and we're talking about timing and magnitude of the benefits that you start to get there. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit? Is it a little too early to start really talking about this as a tailwind in something like '24 or is it really with us? John Stankey : Sure, Dave. How are you? I don't agree with your thesis at its point. I absolutely 100% dismiss your thesis. And I don't think that's how the market is structured and functioning today by any stretch of the imagination. I think our -- I go back and I look at our performance over the last 2.5 years, first of all, I would tell you, I think the industry is a lot more healthy than many who would like to trying to come up with this narrative? Is competition up? Or is it destroying itself? I mean I see a pretty consistently competitive industry over this period of time. And I tend to look at it not just on customer counts, but I look at things like both wholesale and retail revenues and how that's flowing through to service revenues. And I see a relatively balanced dynamic in the industry, but the math would tell you that balance dynamic would suggest we've been picking up a bit of share when it's all said and done. And I don't think that's a benefit of the number moving from whatever you assume the normal stasis is $7.5 million to $9 million. In fact, I would say of customers that are paying a reasonable monthly bill, we've taken more than our fair share, and I'm more interested in taking revenue share and profitability share than I am necessarily just taking a subscriber share. And I think our numbers would suggest that we've seen an ever improving trend over the 2.5 years in our ability to do that. So I don't submit to your point of view that if the \"industry normalizes\" we revert back to kind of where we were three years ago. I think where we are is because of how we're performing today, not what was going on three years ago, and that's kind of how I think about it.  What I would tell you, Dave, is I don't think there's a windfall that comes in on restructuring of legacy costs. And I've I think I've been on this theme for a little while. I mean we've been working this issue pretty aggressively since the day I came into the job, and I would say we had to start formulating the plans when I came in, but now we have a very robust and functioning organization that we're doing this kind of day in and day out. And I spend more time talking about investing in the new business and the growth that we can get on sustainable fiber and a 5G infrastructure than I do on talking about what we are taking out of service, but we are taking stuff out of service. And so when we start managing things like our energy costs down, it's because we're decommissioning equipment and taking it off the copper grid when we are able to manage our dispatches down and show you improvements in our operating dynamics on dispatches. It's because we have a smaller footprint to manage. We are doing this day in and day out. And our pace at which we're doing it is accelerating. We've -- I've given you some hints along the way about the number of products that we've shuttered and when we shuttered those products, it starts to take operating costs out of the business. This is part of what we have in our forecast to you to continue to improve our operating costs. So you're seeing this operating leverage start to come into the business, and it's partly contributed to the fact that we're managing through these legacy costs. And as we give you the forecast for cash this year, when we talk about improvements in our overall cost structure, some of it is coming on the backs of what we're doing here. And I'm very well aware of where our cost structure is on a comparative basis to others that we compete with in the industry, some of which do not have the hybrid asset structure that we have of both fixed and mobile. And we are on this mission to ensure that we're not operating any of that at a disadvantage over the next three, four and five years. And I think you're going to just see this ratably come in over that period of time as we work through what is -- it's frankly a bit of a painstaking process to go through. It's central office by central office line by line, customer by customer, but it needs to be done. I think it can be done in a way that makes us a better and healthier business where we have a great hybrid of a fabulous fiber footprint with a fabulous wireless network that is ultimately the future of how customers are going to buy together, and I like that. I think that hard work will be rewarded in that regard, but I will fully admit, we are creating new intellectual property here around how you get to this space. And I'm choosing to do it organically internally, not through a front-end private equity transaction that puts a little bit of cash in my pocket but ultimately has the value of it accrue to somebody else over the hard work of three, four and five years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with SVB MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : I want to stay, if I could, with this topic of your portfolio of broadband, John, if I think about your kind of overall Mobility national footprint, it sort of maps with today roughly call it, 16%, 17% of the country already overbuilt with fiber, another 10% or 12% to be overbuilt with fiber. Can you just talk about how you think about the consumer value proposition in those different segments where you have wireless that doesn't have a fiber component where it does? And then -- and what role fixed wireless might play to sort of round out that consumer value proposition. John Stankey : Yes. The way I think about it, Craig, is -- and I tried to use this reference earlier is, I think it's a bit of a -- I don't want to use the term land rush, because it's not it's not that easy to put fiber and it takes a little bit longer than a land rush, but we are definitely in a window right now where I do believe a good portion of the United States will ultimately have a fiber connection to it. And I believe there will be -- if you think about this over the long haul that we're moving to an industry, and I've been pretty clear about this, ultimately, customers are going to want to buy connectivity from one place. They don't necessarily love making a distinction between their fixed provider and their mobile provider. And I think over time, we're going to see an ordering of industry assets that leans more toward that. And my point of view to be in a strong position as you -- if you have the best technology out there and you ultimately build the largest footprint fastest, you're going to be in a better position to ultimately play in the outcome of how that restructuring gets done, and you're going to have the strongest customer base on a relative basis and owning and operating those assets and having the ability to control the product offering and control the cost on it will be the best way to control your progress going forward. So yes, it's a deliberate process to continue to build fiber infrastructure and ultimately overlay it with the wireless business, but that's a process that I think is incredibly durable and sustainable. And my job is to make sure I'm doing it faster and better than anybody else and I think it'll come out in an okay place as a result of that. And as I said, my job is to ensure that people who give us money to go and allow for us to make that investment feel that on a marginal basis, on an incremental basis, we're doing that in a way that's driving successful returns. I think fixed wireless, as I said, has its place in the portfolio. I don't see it's place long term in dense metropolitan areas, and I don't see it in reasonably well populated suburban areas. I don't see the dynamic of that product, and I've been pretty clear about this, if I start to think about consumer behavior and demand of consumption, and I start to take those curves out over three years, I don't see that as the optimal way to service a customer in the near term. So I think the mobile network's role in life is to ensure that whenever somebody is away from a fixed location, they can still get the same kind of capabilities that they get while they're at home, but there's only a certain amount of bandwidth that a mobile network will ever be able to foster and support in that regard. Mobile bits are going to be higher-value bits. They're going to need to be engineered differently. They should sell at a premium because of the supply and demand dynamics on it. And I want to ensure that my mobile network is, in fact, delivering that premium solution on those mobile bets when they need to be provided. And it's absolutely 100% there to do that. And I think at the end of the day, if your mobile network is doing that mad fashion, then you're going to have an opportunity to work in the high-value mobile space for what are going to be emerging capabilities that people need to facilitate the true promise of 5G and real-time transmission ubiquitously any place anywhere. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Craig. Operator we have time for one last question. Operator : And that last question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Just thinking a little bit more about the wireless growth opportunity, can you share with us how AT&T is doing with the uptiering of customers onto unlimited and premium unlimited plans? And then given some of the comments on inflation, are there opportunities for AT&T to update wireless and fiber pricing again this year? And are any of those opportunities included in the guidance? John Stankey : Hi, Mike. So I'm not going to -- look, it's just not good hygiene to talk about what our plans are on pricing, and I don't intend to do that today. I would just maybe point you back to -- we have a management team who is very good at understanding where we have great value to our customer and where we're selling in that market. And are we getting the maximum value and value exchange back from the customer. And that's across all of our products and services. Last year, I mean, you can see we saw an area where we felt like -- we had some customers that weren't taking advantage of the best plans that we had to offer with the most recent features. and we decided to work in our customer base to help them understand that there were better places they could go where there was maybe an exchange for them to pay us a little bit more, but to get a lot more for what they were paying us. I think we executed that incredibly well. We just gave you churn numbers that were incredibly strong churn numbers, all while we did that, and I think you should step back from that and say that's pretty good execution. I'm not sitting here telling you about I grew service revenues and I'm dealing with a customer flight problem. I dealt with lower churn. And I think that's a testament to the fact that we were able to get a win-win proposition and our customer base with the customers walked away feeling better about the circumstances, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. Anywhere in our portfolio on any product where we think we can do those types of things, that's just part of being good management. I would expect that there's always opportunities for us to look into that where I think we are on our ability to walk people up the value continuum. We still have room. We're not -- we're not through the 5G replacement cycle. As you know, when a customer comes in and chooses to do that upgrade, that's a great opportunity for us to talk to them about what product and services that they have and to help them understand that maybe buying a more robust plan or fine-tuning how they're buying plants for us might fit into their portfolio and give them the best value. And we do expect we're going to continue to make headway on that. That's part of that service revenue growth the past call guided due to. I don't think anything that we've got in there is Herculean. We've been talking about this for the better part of three years with you. Every year, we've managed to do what we said we were going to do, and it's been consistent with the service revenue numbers that we forecasted for you. I think you should also understand that the global economy is not completely recovered from the pandemic. We still expect that as travel continues to normalize itself that we're going to see a little bit of uptick in relief coming from the likes of more global visitors coming in on roaming and people going places. I think Asia is still going to be suppressed for a period of time, but let's hope the back end of recent policy changes that have occurred in Asia means that we will eventually hit a normalization there that will ultimately get us back to kind of pre-pandemic norms at some point, which is it's good to be going down that path as opposed to having a major footprint that is kind of trying to create a fortress and not allow people to move back and forth between their borders. So we started at the beginning of the end there, which is good. So I don't feel any concern around whether or not we can effectively move people up that continuum. We still have room to grow. We're banking on that in our guidance and we'll execute around it just as we have any other years. I don't know if you want to add anything there, Pascal. Pascal Desroches : No, I think that's all well said. John Stankey : So again, I appreciate your time this morning. I'm really pleased with the year. I thought it was a strong consistent execution year I'm just equally as pleased that we've done the right things to set us up for continued growth as we move through '23. I hope you feel the same. I know the management team is very focused on delivering what we shared with you this morning is our expectations. I feel really good about where our customer base is. As I mentioned just a few moments ago, to have churn levels in our wireless business running at the position they're in with the competitive intensity that is occurring in the industry to have the position we have with our broadband base on fiber and the customer satisfaction is coming with it, I think, bodes incredibly well even in an uncertain environment as we're moving forward.  And the good news is, I think we can grow in both those places to continue to drive the kind of tempered indirect growth that we shared with you. So we're looking forward to doing it again next year. I think we've got the right opportunities in place. I think there's a lot more that we know we can still do to run this business better, and we're about doing that to ensure that we deliver improved performance for you moving forward. So thank you very much. I hope you all have a great '23. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information, including our earnings materials, are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us. Earlier today, we shared our first quarter results, which again illustrate how we're meeting our commitment to grow high-quality, durable 5G and fiber customer relationships. Thanks to a consistent discipline and return focused go-to-market approach, our team is balancing customer growth with profitable long-term value creation as we connect people to greater possibility. And I'm particularly proud of the quality of our subscriber additions. Despite high promotional activity seen in parts of our industry, we continue to achieve consistently low churn levels while increasing the take rate of our high-value 5G and fiber plans. We believe our results demonstrate that the customer-centric strategy we launched almost three years ago continues to deliver the right mix of quality subscriber and profit growth that will prove sustainable over the longer term. So let me highlight some of our progress. Let's start with mobility. In January, I shared that we anticipated industry demand trends would continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. However, we still expect it to grow both postpaid phone subscribers and wireless profits, thanks to investments in our customer experience, distribution channels and network, and that's exactly what our teams delivered. We had 424,000 postpaid phone net adds in the first quarter and continued to grow wireless service revenues, EBITDA and postpaid phone ARPU, all while maintaining historically low churn. Checking the box for each of these success metrics paints a clear picture of what sustainable, profitable wireless growth looks like. We've now had more than 11 straight quarters of 400,000 postpaid phone net adds or better, and we've totaled 2.6 million postpaid phone net adds over the past four quarters. We're pursuing longer-term growth by remaining committed to fostering durable relationships that solve customer pain points and bring great value to our customers. We're executing well on our disciplined go-to-market strategy that centers around putting the customer first and takes advantage of our improved distribution. We also continue to hone our ability to deliver targeted solutions that provide real value to customers in our historically underpenetrated segments, like first responders, as well as small and medium businesses. This approach establishes a long-term growth trajectory that thoughtfully balances customer additions with profitable returns. Now let's turn to our fiber business. Quarter after quarter, our teams proved that wherever we build fiber, we win. And the first quarter was no exception, with 272,000 AT&T fiber net adds. This marks 13 straight quarters with more than 200,000 net adds. These net adds were a significant achievement with a number of household moves, a key growth metric for fiber sales, decreasing nationwide. As we noted at the end of last year, our fiber subscribers now outnumber non-fiber and DSL subscribers. We now have about 7.5 million AT&T fiber subscribers, with the fiber adoption and margin expansion driving Consumer Wireline revenue and EBITDA growth. We believe that AT&T offers the best wired Internet service available anywhere, that this elevated AT&T fiber experience is providing a strong tailwind. So overall, across both 5G and fiber, I'm very happy with the high-quality subscriber adds we achieved in the quarter, and these long-term customer relationships provide a great and profitable revenue stream now and into the future. Even in the midst of increased macroeconomic uncertainty, we're executing more sharply and efficiently after repositioning our operations around our connectivity strengths. We remain on track to achieve our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target by the end of the year, if not sooner. As we mentioned before, the benefits from these efforts are expected to increasingly fall to the bottom line. While we've largely delivered what we set out to accomplish three years ago, our journey has only raised our confidence that we can continue to evolve and improve. In fact, we believe we can further accelerate cost takeouts as we progress through the year. Part of this entails transforming our network as we ultimately replace our copper services footprint with best-in-class fiber connectivity, and where it makes sense for customers, replacement products built on our wireless network. Think about a cost structure that's no longer anchored to legacy network technologies and software stacks. For example, in addition to all of fiber's enhanced resiliency and its superior transport characteristics, we're already seeing that fiber uses less energy, costs less to maintain and requires fewer service dispatches. And as we reduce our copper services footprint and related legacy infrastructure, we expect to consistently improve our margins, grow EBITDA and, ultimately, improve our capital efficiency. Another contributing element relies on unlocking new capabilities that make it easier to collaborate and get work done by leaning into our digital transformation. We're seeing this already come to life through early trials in our collaboration with NVIDIA, where we're testing the use of artificial intelligence to improve fleet dispatches so our field technicians can better serve customers. Separately, we're using AI to match customers with the right customer care support path, resulting in more effective issue resolution. We think this is only the tip of the spear of what's possible. Now let's turn to our final priority, which centers on how we're allocating capital, we continue to invest in our 5G and fiber networks at record levels in order to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth. Our goal is to build a network that not only meets today's demands but will serve the needs of our customers for decades to come. This is at the core of what we do and who we are as a company, it's also why we continue to be one of America's largest capital investors. We're investing in our connectivity infrastructure, and using our team's proven expertise to not only maintain our network advantages but to advance it, and we're doing this while moving forward on our commitment to provide more Americans with access to reliable high-speed broadband. We plan to actively pursue bead funding to support the transition of our wireline footprint and expect to be a significant participant in public private partnerships. And while we're clearly committed to investing in our networks, we also remain focused on the strengthening of our balance sheet and reducing our net debt. We expect to increase cash generation over time, which will allow us to continue delivering an attractive dividend with improving credit quality. And by executing on the simplified capital allocation framework, we expect to improve our financial flexibility in the long run. This will provide us with the opportunity to take additional actions, such as investing to accelerate our business growth or generating incremental values and returns for our shareholders. Now before I wrap up, I'd like to quickly touch on some developments we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. We started the year with the expectation that we'd be operating against a less-predictable macro backdrop. This belief has proven true thus far. And what we're seeing is in line with the expectations we built into our guidance in January, including a moderation of growth for wireless services. We expected to transition back to more historical cost of debt. That is certainly underway, with the added dose of tighter credit availability to some segments of the economy. I'm clearly not breaking any ground with these observations, but this is why we have been focused on reducing our leverage and optimizing our use of capital over the last few years. As the economy adjusts to a likely period of tighter capital availability and higher interest rates, I take comfort in the state of our business for two reasons. The first is the heavy lifting we did to strengthen our balance sheet over the last several years. We've reduced our debt, taking advantage of the prior low interest rate environment on our remaining debt and managed our debt towers for the next several years. As a result, more than 95% of our debt is now fixed at an average rate of 4.1%. The second is the repositioning of our business to focus on exclusively communication services, particularly 5G and fiber. As the last few years have demonstrated, the solutions we provide are more critical than ever before, and we only expect the demand for purpose-built, best-in-class Internet access to grow. The resiliency of the services we provide, coupled with our improved financial flexibility, provide us with the right tool set to navigate the economic environment. We remain on track to deliver the 2023 financial and operating commitments we made to our shareholders at the start of the year. However, should the need arise, we feel comfortable using the tools we have at our disposal to align our actions with a more challenging economic backdrop, whether that's accelerating cost transformation actions, being more deliberate with our capital spend or increasing our liquidity. To conclude my remarks, I'd simply reemphasize that I'm proud of how our team started the year. Last quarter, I said that our approach and strategy for 2023 was to do it again. In the first quarter of the year, our teams have done just that. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we typically provide a brief review of our subscriber trends at this point in our prepared remarks. But today, I'd like to zoom out and connect the dots on the progress we've made so far on our multiyear journey to reposition our core operations. Our goal has been to take advantage of the expected increase demand for wireless and broadband connectivity by adding customers the right way, with a focus on long-term value. We recognize that in order to do that, we had to increase our investments in the business to enhance our customer value proposition and make more memorable and lasting connections with our customers. We understood that these investments would have a short-term impact on wireless ARPU and profits, but over time, would build durable customer relationships and deliver attractive returns. Over the last few quarters, you've started to see the full picture and the results of these efforts. In mobility, our largest business unit, we're growing subscribers and taking share. We also continue to see very healthy ARPU. This translates to growth in wireless service revenues and EBITDA, while improving margins. We've grown both revenues and EBITDA year-over-year for four consecutive quarters, and this past quarter was the best first quarter for mobility EBITDA in the Company's history. In Consumer Wireline, we've invested to increase our fiber footprint to provide customers with best-in-class access technology. Over the course of the past three years, we added about 6 million fiber locations that we can now serve. By doing this, we successfully transformed the business that was in secular decline into a growth business, with fiber growth outpacing legacy wireline declines. The consistency of our results across 5G and fiber provides us with confidence that our go-to-market approach is both sustainable and delivers attractive returns. These results are the outcome of the hard work our teams have done and show the value in what we've been working towards the last three years, and now it's about continuing to deliver quality growth with attractive returns. So again, we're clearly growing the right way and focused on the long term. Now let's turn to our first quarter financial summary on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues were up 1.4% in the first quarter, largely driven by wireless service revenues and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Consumer Wireline. This was partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline as well as lower mobility equipment revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3.9% for the quarter as growth in mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline were partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 compared to $0.63 in the year ago quarter. In the quarter, there were about $0.06 of aggregated EPS headwinds from higher pension, lower DIRECTV equity income and higher effective tax rate. This was partially offset by strong growth in mobility. Cash from operating activities came in at $6.7 billion versus $7.6 billion last year. This was largely due to the timing of working capital, which includes lower securitizations. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically the high watermark for device payments, and we expect payments to progressively get lower as we make our way through the balance of the year. Capital investments were $6.4 billion as we continue to make historically high levels of investments in 5G and fiber. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. This was consistent with our expectations and accounts for several seasonal and anticipated working capital impacts. We remain confident in our full year outlook for free cash flow of $16 billion or better. This expectation is largely due to the timing of capital investments, device payments, incentive compensation, which all peaked in the first quarter. Now let's look at our mobility operating results on Slide 7. Before we get started, we disclosed in early March that we modified our business unit reporting and no longer record prior service credits to our individual business turns. Prior period business unit results have been recast for this change. There is no impact to consolidate the operating income, as price service credits continue to be recorded in other income. Looking at our mobility results. Revenues were up 2.5% and service revenues were up 5.2% driven by subscriber growth and higher ARPU. Mobility EBITDA was up $621 million or 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in subscribers, service revenue and the assets of 3G network shutdown costs versus the first quarter of 2022. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.05 up $1.05 or nearly 2% year-over-year. ARPU growth remains largely driven by higher ARPU on legacy plans from last year's pricing actions, a continued mix shift to higher-value rate plans and a continued improvement in consumer international rolling trends. Postpaid phone churn remains low at 0.81% for the quarter. We believe our team's ongoing success can be largely attributed to the consistent investment we've made to build a fast and reliable 5G network and the actions we've taken to ensure our customers feel valued and appreciated. In prepaid, we had 40,000 phone net additions. Our total prepaid churn was below 3%, primarily driven by loyalty from cricket customers who with us as a result of our value and reliability. Overall, I'm really pleased that the team achieved solid subscriber growth even against a moderation in industry demand. I'd like to also quickly acknowledge the strong results posted by our team in Mexico. We're very pleased with the performance of our Mexico wireless operations, which boosted strong revenue and steady profit growth, thanks to improved operational execution and scale. Now let's move to Consumer and Business Wireline results, which are on Slide 8. Let's start with Consumer wireline where our growth was led by our investment in fiber, which is consistently yielding strong returns. We added 272,000 fiber customers in the quarter. This speaks to the quality of the service we're providing and the continued demand for the best Internet technology available today. With our fiber subscribers now outnumbering our nonfiber subscribers, the increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber continues to drive strong broadband results. Broadband revenues grew by more than 7% year-over-year, including accelerated year-over-year fiber revenue growth of more than 30%. Fiber ARPU was $65.92, up more than $1 sequentially, with ARPU for new fiber customers at about $70. Customers are increasingly choosing to take advantage of the benefits offered by faster speed tiers, which is also supporting ARPU growth. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 3.2% for the quarter due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by higher storm costs on the West Coast, which hurt growth by about 250 basis points in the quarter. Overall, we could not be more confident in the future of our Consumer Wireline business, with fiber well positioned to lead our growth in the decade ahead. Turning to Business Wireline. EBITDA was down $230 million year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. This was partially driven by about $50 million in year-over-year comparability factors, including favorable compensation adjustments in the first quarter of last year. Our rationalization process in Business Wireline also continues as we remain focused on the opportunities that 5G and fiber expansion create, particularly in the small and midsized business. Our Business Solutions is service revenues grew nearly 7% despite a moderation in industry growth as we continue to grow faster than our peers. One driver of this growth continues to be FirstNet, where wireless connections grew by about 300,000 sequentially, about 40% of which are postpaid phones. Ultimately, we're making progress on transforming our Business Wireline operations. And when we normalize out for one-time comparison items in the quarter, we still see the same underlying trends and continue to expect full year results aligned to what we guided in January. Now to wrap up my comments. I'll restate that we embedded expectations for a comparatively slower macro backdrop in our full year outlook and, therefore, remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance. We will continue to monitor the economy closely. And if we find ourselves operating in a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated, there are levers to pull. Ultimately, we feel like we have found the right formula to deliver sustainable results with profitable 5G and fiber subscriber gains. We've demonstrated this by growing consolidated EBITDA, improving ARPUs and growing broadband and wireless service revenues, with consistently low postpaid phone churn, and we are confident that this formula will continue to work. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Let's start with free cash flow. Given the 2Q free cash flow guide down last year, what can you add to your comments already to get investors comfortable that we aren't walking into another one of those? John Stankey : Phil, thank you for the question. Overall, our -- we came in exactly as we anticipated. Remember, in my commentary on at the year-end when we gave guidance, we said that Q1 was going to be the low watermark for free cash flow for several reasons. One, it's the highest quarter of device payments. Recall, Q4 holiday sales is the heaviest volume for devices we pay for those in Q1. You saw our capital spend is elevated relative to the annual guidance that we gave. And Q1 is the quarter we pay incentive comp. When you factor all those things in, along with our expectations that we will continue to grow EBITDA, we feel really good about delivering $16 billion or better. Philip Cusick : Maybe if I can follow up there, and forgive me if this is a little amateurish, but just looking at the balance sheet as of June '22, net debt today is $3 billion higher than it was nine months ago. Given all the things that are happening, I understand there are other uses of cash, but is there a point at which the cash generation over and above the dividend starts to actually pay down the net debt of the Company. Pascal Desroches : We expect net debt to decline this year and thereafter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on the fiber. How is the build program going? I think I saw about 600,000 passings in the new locations on the consumer side, but just update us on that 2 million to 2.5 million build program. And also what you're seeing in terms of cohort penetration and take rates. You did slightly lower move activity, but how the kind of the 12-month, 24-month penetration rates are going. And then any updates on timing or structure around GigaPower would be great. John Stankey : Sure, Simon. Look, everything is going great. It's no concerns whatsoever about ability to execute the build supply chain spine, resourcing and capabilities within the vendor community is all good. Teams are executing well. I don't think I have any different commentary of, yes, there's been a little bit of inflationary pressure in some places. By far and away, it's all manageable. It's nothing that blows the business case. In fact, when you offset the cost per living unit increases against what is actually turning out to be faster penetration and higher ARPU than what we had in the, I would call, the fundamental business case, and when we started this process, it's well offset anything we have to worry about in terms of first cost. So, I would tell you from a perspective of we feel very comfortable with what we've told you about our $30 million commitment and where we're going with that. That's not the thing that's taking my time or keeping me up at night. Where we are in terms of our execution, I would probably take my hat off to a couple of individuals in the Company that have been working very hard in this area. And I would tell you, relative to what we spend and how we're going about doing it, I think we're doing a much better job of penetrating our base faster than we are, as I just mentioned. I think that gives us confidence. I've shared with all of you before that one of the three major impacts to improving payback in a fiber business case is if you can penetrate faster than what your expectations are and bring cash flows forward that has an outsized impact on the NBV of the case and the ultimate payback, and we're seeing that happen. Now I would tell you, look, we're building in places that are fiber hungry. And so, I think our effectiveness is indicative of the success of the market and the receptiveness of the market. I don't know if you get three years out on the build if it stays that way, we'll have to continue to watch that. But I think the tactics and the techniques that we've developed collectively as a team between how we promote the brand, what our operations folks do to raise awareness, how we capture those customers, the way we're marketing to them, the effectiveness at which we're marketing to them, I really like what we're seeing. And I think as we continue in this path, we're on the learning curve, and we're going to get better because we're on that learning curve, and we're getting scale on what we're doing. And that's all goodness. On the GigaPower side, we're in good shape. We're very close to closing on the transaction. You should expect that imminently. We're trying to do it the right way and feel very comfortable we're going to get it done the right way. I will also tell you we have our first -- even though the transaction hasn't closed, we have our first live customer up in one of our markets. So, we are in place with all the infrastructure that we need to be able to sell and support customers through our channels. And I want to stress, we are the first seller of product on that infrastructure, and it's not an insignificant accomplishment for us to be able to have everything through the processes of activating our distribution channels and out of region markets so that they can talk to customers and sell and support the product and service, and we can drive the kind of penetration that we want to drive in that infrastructure. So, we feel really good about the progress there. And I will just tell you anecdotally, as I've work around the organization I felt very strongly about our competency and our ability to go and start doing this. I like the energy I see in the teams that are involved in it who feel probably even more confident than I do about it. And they have a lot of motivation to do well there, and I think that's going to serve us well as we move forward. Simon Flannery : Great. And just one last thing. On fixed wireless, you're getting a lot of more C-band spectrum and your 3.45 coming on. How are you thinking now about -- for the copper catch and then potentially out of region doing more in fixed wireless to address the desire for converged bundles? John Stankey : Yes, nothing's changed in my commentary here, Simon. We're out in the market today. We have a consumer product that's there that we've recently brought into play. We are in the process of scaling it so that we make sure that we do it the right way. And we are going to use it where we think we can offer a customer a better set of services than what they currently have, especially when we have an opportunity to go and use it to hold as we're going to build fiber over the next couple of years and come in behind it. Where we have that network capacity, to your point, we are adding spectrum in. We have places where we have [Indiscernible] capacity, and it's a smart play for us to do that to keep a customer in the family, also uses an opportunity, in some cases, to cross-sell and add wireless into the portfolio as we do that. And we will run that play in consumer where it makes sense to run that. And we're seeing good feedback from our customers that we've put out the product with in the consumer space. We are seeing substantial improvements in their service levels. That's a good thing, and we feel that, that's the right way to kind of target and use the product. On the other side of the equation, as I've said many times before, this product is incredibly well suited to parts of the business segment. It's not only well suited in the near term, but it can be a long-term viable product, given the characteristics of how businesses use data depending on the type of segment you're serving. And we've had really good success in business deploying the product. We will continue to deploy it. And feel really good about it in that regard that when we match the product to the right user profile, the right segment profile, it can be a very, very viable opportunity for a sustainable and effective product. And we're seeing that, in fact, play out in the market right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Maybe a question similar to Phil's first question on free cash flow but related to EBITDA. You guys did 3.9% growth this quarter against 3% guidance, but you've got some easy comps on the wireless side. So anything you can tell us about sort of the color you have or the sort of confidence you have in hitting that 3% number. You also called out some storm costs in California, any other sort of one-timers inside of these numbers that can give us more comments? And then lastly, on the cost side, you guys have been aggressive taking out headcount. And John, you mentioned potentially accelerating the headcount or the cost-reduction initiative. So just any additional color there, is there more headcount to go? How far through the 6 billion are you? And should we see that translate into better margins? Pascal Desroches : John, here is the way I would characterize the quarter. It was a really solid nearly 4% growth. There are -- yes, there were 3G shutdown in the prior year, but there were also some items that went the other way. So when I pierce through all of that, all the one-time items, this is right in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of the year of 3% or better growth. John Stankey : So John, West Coast, I think, is pretty well publicized in what went on out there relative to the rains, and we still have a large, I'll call it, legacy footprint that ultimately we're spending a lot of time and energy and working our way out of. And you see what happens still when you get a lot of wetness on copper, it just doesn't work well. And I think this is one of the things that gives us a high degree of confidence we have opportunities for additional cost takeout in this business. As we reposition to 5G and fiber, that cost structure we still carry. And I'm really pleased we made some changes about a year ago in how we organize within the business and how we focus on our operating cost structure that is putting the right kind of exposure on how we execute around that cost migration. So this is partly an answer to your question of what was unusual and also what we expect to do moving forward beyond the $6 billion. We will now start to see some momentum build in that regard as we begin to shutter legacy costs in the business, and I think we're making the steps that need to be made to be able to do that on a geography basis, as opposed to we don't need to see the last customer disappear before costs start to come out of the business. And so, we have much better instrumentation I think we're building the muscles around how to do this. It's not easy stuff. I will admit to that. I would -- I wish we didn't have to spend as much time and energy on it, but we are. And I think we're getting it into a place that I've watched this business for years, that the flywheel will start to turn and we'll get the benefits out of it. And I feel really good about that. And I think that's when I talk about moving beyond the $6 billion. One of it is it's the fundamental restructuring of the business and getting to the backside of that. You may have noticed as well to show you how serious we are about this and how aggressively we're working it. We met a large filing that's public in California about restructuring the regulatory construct in California. That proceeding will take place over the course of the next year. And it's one that we've been working really hard with policymakers out there to do it the right way, make sure that we step up to serving customers in a way that accomplishes public policy objectives, while at the same time, positions the business well for a sustainable, cost structure and incentive investment in the state moving forward. And I'm confident that we can move through that process. The last thing I'll just comment on in the first quarter, you probably saw that the weather patterns broadly across the United States were pretty challenging. And so while they were most pronounced on the West Coast, we were chasing a lot of issues broadly with ice and a variety of power dynamics that we're moving on. And I would say just generally speaking, it was not a friendly quarter to operating costs just to deal with the things that we need to deal with to make sure the network keeps running. And I think we came through it in pretty good shape relative to our commitments. And I think that's one of the things that we believe will be in good shape from a cash production perspective as we move through the year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Two, the first one is actually a quick follow-up to John's question and the second one is on wireless. So the follow-up is, with regards to your headcount reductions, typically there are costs associated with your workforce whether its severance or other separation costs. I don't think you're adding that back to your adjusted financials. So I'm just curious if you could potentially size what the impact of those costs have been? And then on wireless, as you noted, you're expecting this normalization of wireless sector trends, you've already seen some of that in the first quarter. I'm curious how that's impacting the way you go to market. In other words, have you resized your advertising and your marketing budgets? Have you, in any way, narrow the scope of who's eligible for some of your best offers? And you're also coming up on almost a one-year anniversary of the last time you took some price. I'm curious how you're thinking about pricing power in this environment. Pascal Desroches : Brett, on the first part of your question, the thing to keep in mind is, as it relates to Q1, a lot of the head count reduction we saw in Q1 was accrued for as of the end of the year that was in the prior year numbers. So really didn't impact Q1 materially. By and large, look, this is a program we've been on for the last several years. And March will -- we expect it to continue, and it's one that in the normal course will incur severance on those, but it's all pretty manageable within the context of this company. John Stankey : Brett, what I would tell you on the go-to-market side is, there really hasn't been any change at all. In fact, I think the headline is we're doing what we've been doing. And we're going after customers that we think are profitable customers, and we're doing it in the same way. And some of that is just a matter of I think the variable piece of it is when you're doing subsidy on a customer-by-customer basis, there's, of course, adjustment in that. So as you see volumes come down, certain equipment costs and the like are going to resize themselves to those volumes. But when you start thinking about how we're promoting in the market, I won't say that there's going to be any substantial changes in anything that you see on distribution channel costs or go-to-market costs that would be anything different than the variable cost of moving from volume of 700,000 net adds to 400,000 net adds that might flow through things like commissions and equipment costs, et cetera, that are pretty typical. Look, we continue to always look for places where we can manage the value equation. And we opened with some of the comments in the prepared remarks, deliberately to demonstrate to you that, I think, we do a pretty effective job of that. If there's something I would ask you not to lose is we're coming off the most profitable quarter and most lucrative EBITDA generation in our wireless business in its history and it's got the goodness of low churn, higher ARPU and customer growth. And that equation is there, and we're managing it deliberately. And you don't just pull one lever to make that happen. There's all kinds of things that have to come together and the recipe, one of which is where you have opportunities to move customers up a continuum or you have opportunities where you may be are priced differently to market, you use those levers. And we'll continue to do that as we move through the year. And I think our confidence in doing that is indicative of the guidance that we've given you as we move through it. We dynamically watch credit in the market. That's -- it's algorithmic in many instances. We do things as we go through the year. We're looking at a variety of different things in a variety of different segments, and we adjust. That's not new to this moment in time. That's something we do kind of dynamically as we run the Company. We've been making adjustments to different segments and different offers consistently. And I would say, look, as we move through the year, if circumstances change or we see particular segments being stressed in different ways, well, we'll do things to adjust the availability of certain offers in certain places, yes. And have we done that and is that just a normal course of business? Yes to that as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Just curious if you could unpack a little bit more of the slowdown in wireless postpaid phone performance in terms of the industry impact versus what you're seeing in the share of gross adds. And within that context, if you could provide some color on the activity levels that you're seeing between the consumer and the business segments. John Stankey : Sure, Mike. So first of all, I don't think there's anything that I see. We're the first to report, so I don't know numbers from elsewhere. Obviously, we use many of the same vehicles you use to sense what's going on in the market, to determine. I would tell you that my conclusion right now is we're seeing, what I will call, proportional dynamics going on in the market. I think status quo is the way I would characterize it. As things kind of roll out here, I wouldn't -- I'll be surprised if it's dramatically different than ratios that we've seen from previous quarters right now, which I feel pretty good about, frankly, given our discipline around how we've been going after the right kind of customers. I think the value proposition is still strong. I would tell you that on the customer base side, we've seen probably places in both segments where consumer at the lower end of the market are probably making the kind of decisions that people make when money is a little bit tighter. They're maybe extending the use of their device a little bit longer. It's not an issue of them not wanting the service. They're just making a decision to stick with their earned handset a little bit longer and maybe pushing that discretionary decision to move up. So we've seen a little bit of a drop-off relative to some of the traditional upgrade rates and the shopping rates associated with that. And then I would tell you in business, it's probably a combination of things going on. One is, as we've told you, going through the COVID period. There was better-than-projected growth I think. And we have been saying all along that some of that was being driven by COVID itself. Businesses that needed solutions to deal with the change in their operations, and that could have been how they were dealing with things in a more remote fashion or it could have been what they were doing with their employees to equip them to work outside of the office. As people have been coming back into work and the economy has been normalizing, some of those products and services have reached their point of use that they no longer need them. And there's a little bit of that going on where people are making their businesses more efficient and trimming. And the wireless business is, of course, correlated to headcount and as some businesses have done some things to trim their employee ranks, you see that flowing through on handsets and data cards and things like that. It's, again, nothing that's out of the pattern of what we expected in terms of overall growth in the industry. We still have very healthy business services growth. We feel very comfortable about our share. We shared with you in the opening remarks that we're penetrating in segments like in the public safety area better than the market in total, and all considered that's pretty consistent with what we expected this year. Pascal Desroches : Mike, one other point just to underscore. When we look at some of the key measures like porting ratios, our level of churn, those would all suggest, as John said, we are doing just on relative to the overall population of growth that is out there in the industry. So, we feel really good about our performance, and it's really in line and consistent with our expectations of a normalization of consumer demand that we expected to come in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : I guess two, if I could. The first one, Pascal, thank you for sharing the supplemental free cash flow walk to the adjusted EBITDA number, I think that one of the things that stands out there is the negative $2.7 billion working capital. And if I wanted to look at this page and think about how it looked for the full year 2023 based on your prior comments, that working capital number would have to be positive, which is a huge change, and it's very hard for us on our side of the fence to really model and understand and see. So if you could be as granular as possible about explaining how that changes over the course of the year would be super helpful. And then, John, if I could ask you a question. Something material that's changed over the course of this quarter is that DISH has kind of become a distressed security, both in the equity and in the bond markets. And I think that -- my question is, has that changed your calculus about the potential for a DTV-DISH combination? And/or is that a potential opportunity for new spectrum acquisition if that were to come about, or is new spectrum not really a priority for your capital allocation? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how that evolution it's impacting your thinking? Pascal Desroches : Dave, here's what I would point you to. Within the first quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is -- we are at the high watermark of our device payments. And it's the only quarter that has our annual incentive compensation. Those two things, coupled with our elevated CapEx relative to our full year guide, hurt Q1 to the tune of $3 billion to $4 billion, and we expect that to turn during the course of the year just mechanically. It really isn't much harder than that. Like based upon our spend, what we expect to spend in those categories, those should turn mechanically. So we feel really good about being able to deliver 16% or better. John Stankey : Dave, on your commentary on DISH, I don't want us stipulate necessarily to your characterization. I'm sure Charlie probably doesn't stipulate to them. But first of all, I've never really commented on my point of view of what the calculus is in the combination of DIRECTV and DISH, and I don't expect to do that today. It's just not something we typically speculate on. I think Charlie has been the one that largely had commentary on that. He's certainly entitled to do that. So you might be a better person to ask, and in the circumstances, he's probably far more intimate to his business than I am. Look, I think we step back all the time and ask ourselves what's the structure of the industry moving forward and what's going to occur. And I think I would just say the best way to maybe sometimes predict the future is look at the past, which is when there's been valuable spectrum available through any form or fashion, whether it is the decision to do a combination of a business, like what we did with LEAP, or whether it's doing things at auction that we think are responsible and appropriate, we think that we always want to make those investments with the sustainability of the business. If there were to be a spectrum reordering for whatever reason, either from auction or asset changes or whatever, would we be -- we understand it, want to understand if there's elements of that, that are more effective than us putting capital into the network to build density and those types of things, we'll continue to evaluate that and make appropriate decisions as we can moving forward. And it's -- I'm not going to go into the details of how we think about what the scenarios are and what we can play out, but you can guess that given the amount of money that's involved in it and the importance to the business, that we're constantly evaluating those things and determining what scenarios might play out, what we might do and what makes sense for the Company. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Can you characterize the threshold that you have to hit for FirstNet to remain within the government guidelines, will be the first question. The second was sort of excluding the 30 million home capacity with fiber and excluding California, what percentage of the rest of your footprint are you free from a regulatory perspective to replace the copper with fixed wireless or some form or something else like that? John Stankey : Frank, would you maybe clarify for me when you say government guidelines exactly what you're alluding to in that question? Frank Louthan : I was under the impression there was a certain number of subscribers needed to hit for the FirstNet over a certain time period. Just curious where you are on that relative to the number of subscribers you have in the network today? John Stankey : I just wanted to make sure I was answering your question in a straightforward fashion. We -- I would tell you we are in really good shape. We're kind of through what I would call the first set of milestones that frame the first seven years of the contract, and we've picked through all those responsibilities and obligations as expected, and there's nothing there that's problem or anything alerting. In fact, broadly speaking, I think we've performed incredibly well. And my -- I don't want to speak on behalf of the FirstNet authority. But I think both parties feel like it's been a very productive public-private partnership, and we continue to plan for what we can do in the future to extend it in other ways and do big things with it. So on the rest of the footprint, California is really kind of the outlier. We have freedom from our carrier of last resort obligations in virtually every other territory we operate in. How that gets done is a little bit different in each territory, but we have the latitude to do what we need to do. We've been doing a lot of work, and this is one reason we're at the filing stage in California on ensuring that we have to catch products to be able to support customers. And I'm really pleased with where we are. You obviously know what we can do with data services on the wireless network with fixed wireless. I talked about that just a few minutes ago as to where we are in the market and our ability to be there. But we've also been putting in place a scaled wireline replacement for basic phone service that has all the same features and characteristics and meets the regulatory criteria of what has traditionally been copper-fed pot services that we can support off the wireless network today. And those are two examples. There's more that are necessary, but two examples of replacement products that are better suited to play into our forward-looking architecture, which is a scaled wireless network than to serve off low-speed services, like copper. And we feel like those are really, really good products. In fact, in many instances, offer a customer better benefits than what they get today. And I think regulators are interested as we are doing all the right things to move forward. They don't want power-consumptive copper out there adding to greenhouse gases. They don't want people on technology that was built 100 years ago that fails when it rains. And so, I feel like we're in a very good place to be able to do what we need to do. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk : John, AT&T played a pretty critical role when smartphones, I mean, specifically the iPhone, was rolled out, less so, I think, probably with tablets. There's been a lot of buzz about augmented reality as kind of the next device. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on like what an operator -- wireless operators role will be. Have you had any initial discussions on how those relationships would work with the number of device makers out there? John Stankey : Walt, the answer is, look, I think all wireless providers are going to be instrumental to making this happen. And I believe you've heard me talk about the reality is 5G becomes pervasive and actually operates in the way 5G was intended to operate from a design perspective, which is you have the kind of ubiquity and the radio that's out there. You have actually the additional spectrum that gives you the right level of performance as 5G stand-alone cores are perfected so that they work the way they were intended to work, which, as with any new technology, that's been a little bit of a journey to get them to actually operate in the right way with the radio access layer given the complexity of the radio access layer in the United States, things like augmented reality are going to, in fact, become the opportunity of what are the new services that can come in place. And I don't think it's going to be unique to AT&T. I think our competitors are going to do the same thing, and we're all building networks that are capable of supporting that. And we will, as we have in the past, probably be one of the types of channels that help distribute these additional devices that people ultimately will use in new ways. And more than likely, there are going to be things that are nice add-ons to family plans. And as I talked about, the reality of usage going up on these networks and why it's so important to have a fixed cost structure, these are the kind of things that I think are really, really important. Because if you're in a variable dynamic and all of a sudden the new device shows up and becomes part of the family plan that drives another couple of gigabits of usage and you're paying on a variable basis, that's not going to be a comfortable place to be when the realities of the next generation of applications come in 5G. And I expect that's going to happen. You -- I know you do a lot of homework, you know what the manufacturers are working on right now. We know what the manufacturers are working on right now, and we know when they're likely to come about, they're going to come about when these networks are scaled. The networks are going to be scaled as we exit this year. And I think you're going to start to see the new application to start to pop up as a result of that. Walter Piecyk : I also just have a follow-on question on the structure of the industry. I mean cable is obviously, in many cases, giving away free phones and then just reallocating revenue from the broadband business. And they've had success, I think, in terms of subs, maybe not at higher ARPU, but how do you see AT&T positioned long term in terms of also taking advantage of a bundled approach of offering broadband and mobile on -- in more markets than where you just have your fiber? John Stankey : Well, we use the term durable wall for a reason, which is I don't want to just -- I don't want to spend empty calories for something that 18 months from now or 24 months from now, just looks like a bone acre. And I'm trying to keep the business focused on doing the things that are the hard things that position the infrastructure for the next decade. And so, I've been pretty consistent in my remarks, which is there are going to be places in our network where we have underutilized capacity and I don't have fixed infrastructure, and there's going to be segments where that underutilized capacity can best be used where it's durable. I mentioned earlier in the call, there are many businesses that have usage profiles where I believe fixed wireless bundled in with other wireless services is a very durable offer, and it will be durable for a long period of time to come. There are certain consumer segments where that's durable, but it's not most consumer segments, in my view. And so, we will continue to take advantage of that, where I have confidence that the customer acquisition cost will be worth maintaining the relationship with the customer and will sustain itself. I just -- we were looking at our fiber in service lives, for example, of what's going on right now, and our fiber in service lines are extending over our traditional copper and service lines because it's a great product and people want to keep it. And I know what those in-service lines are. And I know how long people keep that product in service. And the great thing is, when they hold it for 4.5, 5 years, I can scale the product over that period of time, and it's highly profitable. And we need to think about every customer we bring on in that regard, and we're being very diligent in how we allocate our customer investment and our network infrastructure and our capital infrastructure in a way that we're trying to bring on those durable relationships. Again, I would point you back to the churn numbers that we've been putting up on both product sets, and we're trying to be true to that in what we're doing. And to the extent that you do that to subscription base, it plays out well for you over time. And it's just about being deliberate and disciplined in making sure that happens. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much. I think that's all the time we have for questions. John, I'll turn it over to you for final remarks. John Stankey : So, I appreciate everybody joining us this quarter. From my point of view, it was a solid quarter that set us off on the right path to deliver to you what we've committed for this year. We are focused on something very, very basic. It's executing in our markets while we're continuing to restructure the cost of the business, and position our infrastructure for the future, as I just wrapped up with what I said with Walt. And I feel really good about the way we're able to do that. In many respects, I kind of look at what we did operationally this quarter, and I characterize it as uneventful. And as we talk about with the management team right now having a few uneventful things occur when we get to call the plays and operate and execute in the fashion that we designed is absolutely what we want to achieve as a management team as a company and I feel like we're making strides to do that. Thanks for being with us today. I hope you all have a good rest of the spring. End of Q&A: Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that, some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information including our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us. I'd like to open our discussion today by sharing that at the half way point of the year our performance and results are tracking entirely consistent with the guidance we provided to you. In fact, Pascal shares the specifics with you, I think you'll conclude that our performance continues to demonstrate our strategy is on track to achieve the objectives we outlined three years ago : to drive consistent growth; simplify the company; and reduce leverage. To that end, I'd like to spend a few moments today summarizing that progress and how we believe this positions our company for sustainable and profitable growth going forward. Let's start by looking at our wireless. For the last three years our teams have executed on a strategy that enabled us to go from annually loosing share to now delivering the right combination of continued postpaid phone adds, low postpaid churn, growing average revenue per user and profitability growth. Specifically over the past three years, we've added 8.3 million postpaid phone net adds, that's up from fewer than 1 million in the three years prior to July 2020. During the past three years, not only do we close the gap to the industry share leader for postpaid phones by about 350 basis points, but we also improved our wireless service revenue share versus the industry leader by roughly 250 basis points. On postpaid phone churn, we drove an improvement of 28 basis points since the beginning of 2020. We also achieved our record low quarterly postpaid phone churn in two of those three years. In stark contrast, the wireless industry's leaders postpaid phone churn was relatively flat over the same time. Statistics aside from my seat, our historically low levels of churn along with improved mobility net promoter scores shows me that our customers are very happy with the investments we've made in AT&T\u2019s customer experience and network quality and that our teams are delivering great value. Ultimately this means our customers are more likely to stay with AT&T over the long haul. And this is confirmed by external indicators like the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which recently named AT&T as the number one in wireless customer satisfaction. So, more customers are choosing AT&T and staying with AT&T. They're also more profitable as evidenced by our increasing postpaid phone ARPU and service revenues. Over the past three years, our postpaid phone ARPU is up more than a dollar. This shows that customers are voting with their wallets. We've achieved the right balance between the cost of our services and the value we provide. Lastly, let\u2019s look at wireless revenues and profitability. From 2Q 2018 to 2Q 2020, our wireless service revenues were essentially flat. Our profitability was up modestly over that time period. However, in the past three years, we've grown quarterly wireless service revenues by about $2 billion, up roughly 15% and we've materially increased profitability on an annual basis. I should also call out the success we're seeing in our prepaid business, where Cricket has sustained growth by continuing to add prepaid voice customers to one of the highest value subscriber bases in the sector. Now let's turn to our fiber business. Our investment theses for building more fibers started with our understanding that people needed better and faster broadband connectivity than what was available, that those needs would only grow exponentially. We believe that by providing the best access technology on the planet we can transform our consumer wireline business in a fiber fueled sustainable growth franchise. Our results have only strengthened that confidence as returns continue to exceed our initial expectations. Over the past three years, we've had more than $3.4 million AT&T fiber net adds, boosting our subscriber base by roughly 80%. Everywhere we put fiber in the ground we feel good about our ability to win with consumers. In fact, our average penetration rate is about 38%. Over the past three years, our fiber net additions outpaced the leading cable providers broadband net additions. This is an impressive accomplishment given the size of their footprint. Since the second quarter of 2020, we doubled our quarterly fiber broadband revenues reaching more than $1.5 Billion this quarter. And over the past three years, the accretive mix shift to fiber is driven our broadband ARPU up more than $10, an increase of 20%. This again shows that customers are voting with their dollars. We also have plenty of room to run as we're still less expensive than competitive offerings in the market. So let me summarize. Our wireless business is growing share in ARPU with low churn and improving margins. And our fiber business is accelerating new build penetration, growing share in ARPU, while lowering churn and improving margins. This is the formula for sustainable top and bottom line results and we're confident this success will be sustainable over the next three years. As industry convergence accelerates our owners' economics in both fiber and wireless provide AT&T with a strategic advantage that will be hard to match. The lifetime value of our mobile customer is significantly higher than that of a cable MVNO customer. Cable is busy adding wireless customers at very low life time values just to protect customers they already have. We're not only keeping our current high value customers happy, but also adding more of them. Moving to our next priority. I'm pleased with how we continue to simplify our business and improve our efficiency. Our cost savings initiative has achieved our $6 billion run rate savings target and we believe there is significant opportunity to build on this momentum with another $2 billion plus over the next three years. After a period of reinvestment, this work has been the foundation for our recent margin improvements. As shown in our adjusted EBITDA margin improvement this quarter of 210 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. These additional cost savings will be largely driven by the sun setting of our legacy product portfolio as supporting infrastructure. As we ramp our execution on this work, we'll begin to enjoy the benefits of our simplified focus on wireless and fiber. Turning to our final priority. We continue to allocate capital in a deliberate manner to create best-in-class experiences for customers, drive sustainable profitable growth and deliver long term value for shareholders. Over the past three years, we've reduced our net debt by about $20 billion. We also recently transferred $8 billion of pension liabilities through the purchase of insurance annuities. As Pascal will discuss, we've addressed a number of one time and discrete items and now expect to use an increasing amount of our free cash flows after dividends to accelerate our debt reduction efforts. We remain committed to achieving the 2.5 times range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025. We feel good about our ability to accomplish this goal, while providing an attractive dividend with improving credit quality as we expect to increase cash generation over time. At the same time, we're investing in the future of our company and the future of our country's connectivity. Since July 2020, our capital investment has totaled about $65 billion. As one of the largest investors in America's broadband infrastructure we're enhancing our 5G and fiber network at a historic pace. We're focused on connecting the most people and the most places and with the best experience. Over the past three years, we've passed about 7 million new fiber locations, increasing our locations passed by about 40%. Over the same time, we've expanded our nationwide 5G network to cover approximately 290 million people and we now reach more than 175 million with mid band 5G spectrum. While some of our peers spend time trying to convince you why their services are good enough for now, we're investing billions to provide Americans access to the best Internet offering for decades to come. I'll end my remarks by reiterating that the repositioning of our business can be credited to our team's belief in our strategy and ongoing commitment to delivering real value for our customers. We are focused on ensuring AT&T is the clear choice to serve our country's connectivity needs, not only today, but well into the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to our second quarter financial summary on the next slide. Consolidated revenues were up nearly 1% in the second quarter, largely driven by wireless service revenue and fiber revenues. Additionally, revenues in our Mexico operation were also higher due to increases in wholesale and equipment revenues, as well as favorable FX. These increases were partially offset by an expected decrease in low margin mobility equipment revenues and a decline in business wireline. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% for the quarter with growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline in Mexico, this was partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline. We are on track to deliver our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. Given our momentum to date, we are confident in delivering adjusted EBITDA growth of better than 3%. Adjusted EPS was $0.63 compared to $0.65 in the year ago quarter. This includes about $0.07 of non-cash aggregated EPS headwinds from lower pension credits, lower capitalized interest, lower DIRECTV equity income, all of which we expected. Cash from operating activities was $9.9 billion versus $7.7 billion last year and was up $3.2 billion sequentially. The main factors driving this year-over-year increase were : higher receipts driven by earnings growth; higher securitizations; and lower device and interest payments. Capital investment was $5.9 billion in the quarter and $12.4 billion year to date. This reflects continued historically high levels of investment in 5G and fiber. We expect to move past peak capital investment levels as we exit the year. We feel really good about free cash flow of $4.2 billion in the quarter. For the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, free cash flow was up about $1 billion and we expect our cash generation to accelerate from here. We delivered this year-over-year growth in the first half despite about $8 billion lower DIRECTV cash distributions and roughly $7 billion in lower net impact of sales of receivables. We expect free cash flow of about $11 billion for the remainder of 2023 weighted towards the fourth quarter. Here are the factors driving this acceleration of free cash flow relative to the first half performance. One, we expect capital investments to be about $1 billion lower in the second half of the year after peaking in the first half. Two, we anticipate device payments to be about $4.5 billion lower than the first half of the year. Three, the first half of the year included more than $1 billion of annual incentive compensation payments that won't repeat in the second half. Four, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 3%. And lastly, we expect other working capital improvement of roughly $1 billion in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, including higher non cash amortization of deferred acquisition costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by lower cash distributions from DIRECTV of about $500 million in the second half of the year relative to the first half. And cash tax is about $1 billion higher in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. As a result, we are on track to achieve full year free cash flow of $16 billion or better. Now let's turn to our mobility results on the next slide. Looking at our mobility results, postpaid phone net adds were 326,000. Total revenues and profits of our largest business unit are at an all-time second quarter highs. Revenues were up 2% and service revenues were up 4.9%. These gains were driven by subscriber growth and higher ARPU. Mobility EBITDA was up 8.3% in the quarter. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.63, up 1.5% year-over-year. The primary drivers of ARPU growth are : higher ARPU on legacy plans from last year's pricing actions; a continued mix shift to higher value rate plans with higher margins; and continued improvement in consumer international roaming trends. Postpaid phone churn remains low at 0.79% for the quarter. In prepaid, we had 123,000 phone net additions with total churn up 2.5%, primarily driven by Cricket. Let's move to the next slide in our wireline results. Our fiber investment is driving Consumer Wireline growth and strong returns. We added 251,000 fiber customers. This is strong growth against an industry that slowed in recent quarters due to significantly lower move activity. Strong fiber revenue growth of 28% drove broadband revenues up by 7% year-over-year. Our fiber revenues are outpacing our legacy revenues and this separation will continue to grow over time. Fiber ARPU was $66.70, up 8%. Customers are increasingly choosing faster speed tiers, which is also supporting ARPU growth. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 10.2%. This reflects fiber revenue growth and about $35 million of discrete comparison items that helped EBITDA growth rates. Turning to Business Wireline. EBITDA was down about $75 million year-over-year. This quarter included about $75 million in discrete comparison item, including a one-time access cost benefit. Ultimately, we still see the same underlying trend that went into our guidance and our full year expectations are unchanged. Our business solutions wireless service revenues grew 9.1%. FirstNet continues to be a driver of this growth. Connections grew by about 350,000 sequentially, with a little more than one-third of this growth from postpaid phones. What we've accomplished with FirstNet is truly remarkable. Not long ago, this was an underpenetrated segment of our customer base, but by committing to delivering a best-in-class network and tailored solutions for first responders, we\u2019ve become the unquestioned industry leader by exclusively serving the public safety community with 5 million FirstNet connections in just five years. We believe there is runway to continue this growth. Now I'd like to close by taking a moment to provide an update on our capital allocation on the next slide. We wanted to provide some added information around our expectations for reducing net debt. Our plan to reduce net debt and reach the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025 remains on track. Over the course of the past 12 months, we generated $15.2 billion of free cash flow and paid out total dividends and other distribution of $9.3 billion. This left us with $5.9 billion of remaining cash. So why didn't net debt decline by a proportion amount? The short answer is that, we had approximately $4 billion of onetime items and discrete obligations to payoff. These included our WarnerMedia post-closing adjustment payment, our final NFL Sunday Ticket payment and redeeming in full the $8 billion preferred interest in our Mobility to subsidiary. We partly funded this with $7 billion of issuances for other preferred subsidiary shares. Additionally, net debt reflects about $1.5 billion of mark to market impacts from foreign exchange. Keep in mind that our foreign denominated debt is fully hedged, so economically we have an offsetting foreign currency gain in derivatives. Looking forward, in the fourth quarter we expect to make final clearing payment of about $2 billion tied to our 2021 spectrum acquisitions. After this payment, we will be in a position in which, we've satisfied all non-recurring near term financial obligations. The majority of our debt is fixed at very low rates and we have refinanced or refunded some of our near term debt maturities at really attractive rates. At the same time, capital investment will be coming down from all-time peak levels. This will increase cash and give us more cash to reduce net debt/ So going forward, from now until the first half of 2025, we expect to increasingly use our free cash flows after dividend to reduce debt and at a faster pace. By the end of this year, we expect to reduce net debt by around $4 billion, excluding any potential FX impacts which will put us at about the three times range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This puts us on our trajectory to achieve the targeted 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. In summary, we feel good about our plans to delever and about our Q2 results which demonstrates our ability to sustainably grow subscribers, service revenues and profits. Let me turn it back to John to close out our remarks. John Stankey : Before we open it up for Q&A I\u2019d like to briefly comment on the telecommunication industries handling of lead-clad cables in our networks. As background, it\u2019s well understood that lead-clad cables are used broadly in our nation\u2019s infrastructure today. From power cables to telecommunication cables lead has used to protect interior wires from exposure to the elements, because lead is very stable and it doesn\u2019t rust. The practice is long been known and its risks of exposure to those in close contact to it has been regulated by Federal and State authorities for decades. Generally the telecommunications industry began to phase out placement of new lead-clad telecom cables in the 1950s. However, lead-clad cables are so durable that they continue to be used in our power grid, in our railway systems and in our industry and some of these cables still provide important customer voice and data services, including connecting 911 service, fire alarms, and other central monitoring stations. We take the concerns raised very seriously as there is no higher priority than the health and safety of our employees and the communities where we live and work period. We believe that a deliberate review in collaboration with the EPA and our industry partners with reliable science at the forefront is the responsible way to evaluate this issue. Independent experts, longstanding science have given us no reason to believe these cables pose a public health risk. In our own prior testing which we shared publicly confirms the established science. Still, to be responsive to any concerns raised by recent reporting, we're doing additional testing at selected sites and we're working cooperatively with the Environmental Protection Agency to provide them the information needed to conduct a thorough assessment of the issue using the most up to date reliable science. We're very proud of our track record, along with our union partners in addressing employee safety for those who perform maintenance and repair work on these cables. We fully comply with the established regulatory standards and science related to potential lead exposure for workers and meet or exceed state and federal OSHA requirements for our employees who work with lead. In the abundance of caution, one extra measure we've taken is to expand our existing practice of providing testing for employees involved in cable removal, and have added a voluntary testing program for any employee who works with or has worked with lead-clad cables. We're offering the testing on company time and at company expense. Rest assured, that if there's new and reliable information for us to consider, we will constructively work with others in our industry, scientific experts and government agencies to do what we always endeavor to do, which is act responsibly. I hope the information that we've been providing including that lead-clad cables make up a small part of our network with the majority underground encased and protective conduit serves as helpful background on the topic. We've always done the right thing related to lead cables. We're doing the right thing today based on current science and protocols. And will do the right thing should current scientific techniques develop new and reliable evidence that warrants a change and approach. With that said, we're now ready for questions. Amir? Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, John and Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. You had given us some visibility into the net add trends you expected in your wireless business during the quarter, that was very helpful. I was hoping you could share with us what degree of visibility you have into the second half of the year? So for example, are there any unique headwinds that you have to manage through more broadly, what type of market environment are you managing the business around? And are things changing enough at a market level that you're beginning to tweak how you go to market relative to the simplified approach you've been using for a number of years now? Thank you. John Stankey : Hi, Brett. Good morning. Look, I would tell you, I feel really comfortable with where things are. I like to kind of tick through your questions. Given the second quarter issue we had with one account, I don't have another one of those sitting in front of us that I wherever concerned about. I would say more broadly, the market demonstrates a bit more resiliency than probably what I would have expected in the fourth quarter of, say, last year. We're certainly not seeing the kind of frothiness that was around in 2020 and 2021. But volumes and activity in the market is good. We do our own adjustments for some of the reported numbers. I don't know that every net add in the market is equivalent to the other, so we kind of look at the ones that are economic valuable. But even when we make those adjustments, I think demand has been pretty solid in the market. To your point, there were a lot of structural changes in people's offers. In the second quarter they came roughly at about the same time. When new messaging gets put into the market, we saw what we typically saw, which is a little bit of a freezing that occurs as consumers process what new offers are out there. And of course, like you, we sat and watched and wanted to know what the ultimate reaction was going to be. And I would tell you, we've kind of moved through that freezing period and I see a situation where we exited the quarter in a very, very good place. A place that's consistent with what we would have expected given the value propositions and offers we've had in the markets over the past of years. So I feel fine about where things are going. I think that consumer continues to show signs that they're pretty healthy right now. I don't see anything that gives me near term concern about demand. I don't know what happens down the road. It's anybody's guess what the economy does. I've had a fairly conservative bent on that. I think it served us well. I'll keep that conservative bent as we manage the business going through the balance of the year, but the market is certainly supporting, I think, healthy growth and the industry is, I think, even better news, responding well to that growth. I see players investing and I see them making moves to make sure that they can recover returns on those investments. And that's good for all of us. I think it's good for the industry overall and it's good for consumers and the services that they're getting. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thank you. Yes, maybe a follow-up to Brett's question. John, on wireless competition, it looks like gross adds are down sort of mid-teens. And I realize you said that a lot of the change in the sub growth is due to customer loss you had in the second quarter. But do you feel you need to respond from either promotion standpoint to sort of drive gross adds back up? I mean -- and sort of anything you can point to for sort of why you're losing share in terms of those gross adds? And then along with that, a number of your competitors or both of your competitors have announced recent price increases. If you could just comment on the sort of broader pricing environment in wireless? And do you believe that you have room to take similar pricing action as we move through the year? John Stankey : So John, good morning. I don't see a need for us to -- if it wasn't clear from my last comment. There was a little bit of shift that occurred in the second quarter. Part of it was new account, part of it was new offers in the market. We've seen a normalization. And we think what we have out in the market is performing very well. And I go back to comments I've made repetitively in previous quarters. We've been very focused segment wise around where we're choosing to get our activity. And I don't know that broad promotions is necessarily been the primary or by any means, the exclusive means of us getting customers. We've been really deliberate. You look at some of our business results, we just shared with you some of our FirstNet growth. We know the channel is in the consumer market that we can go to to intercept the right kind of traffic. And we've seen really good results as we've kind of gotten into the early part of the second quarter relative to that. So I feel like the market is healthy, I feel like our tactics continue to be durable and they're performing well. We have been very focused on insuring that we're getting the right kind of growth. I don't want empty calorie growth. We want customers to come in and pay good recurring rates that are going to stay with us a long period of time. We have opportunities where we can co-market multiple products into a customer, which makes them even stickier and drives up lifetime values. Those are all very right places for us to go spend time and energy, and we feel very comfortable about that. So I don't feel a need, when you say a need to respond, you're not going to see some dramatic shift in our approach or what we're messaging or how we're going about things. On the pricing side, I think as you know, I've been very deliberate. We don't pre announce any pricing and we don't really talk publicly about changes. But there have been, as I said earlier, I think a lot of efforts in the industry by everybody to ensure that they're getting returns on the level of investments that they're making back into their networks and their business. And you're well aware of what we've done in the past. And we've been really successful and really deliberate and really calculated in how we've done that. That's how we've managed to keep our churn at the levels that we have, while at the same time continuing to get some ARPU accretion in our business. I think you should expect that we're capable in managing the large subscriber base that we have and we look for opportunities to alter that value equation back to the customer where they perceive that they're getting a better value and better service and something more and it accretes into the business in terms of us being able to grow ARPUs. And we certainly have [indiscernible] we'll do that. We do that as a normal course. Sometimes those moves are a little bit more obvious to you. Sometimes they're a little less. But we'll continue to manage the business effectively moving forward and feel really comfortable about our growth characterizations that we've given you in our guidance and what we're going to see in accretion and service revenues. And as you can see, our profitability numbers has been really, really strong. And that all comes from managing the complete equation. I think we're doing a pretty good job of that. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Good morning. I wanted to focus on CapEx if I could. I think Pascal you said it would be about $1 billion lower in the second half. I just want to make sure I had that. I think previously you said $24 billion of CapEx, capital invested was $12.3 billion, I think, in the first half. So, it looks like you might come in in the $23 billion, $23.5 billion range. Is that right? And then $24 billion would be lower than that number. Just want to get those in line. And just be interesting just getting your update on where you are on the wireless network. You talked about getting to 200 million mid-band POPs. What's the plan after that? What's the plan on getting to 250 million and beyond? And maybe any update on putting 3.45 into use and how the [Internet Air] (ph) fixed wireless product is going? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Simon. How are you? Good morning. Yes, as we said, we gave pretty clear guidance that we would be around the same levels as we were last year. In the first half of the year, we spent $12.3 billion to $12.4 billion. And by definition, that is, we're more than halfway through a roughly $24 billion spend. So that's -- the guidance hasn't changed. And importantly, as we think about how efficient our deployment of spectrum has been, that's been one of the things that when we came into the year, we understood that the spectrum that we had acquired was deploying and are propagating much more efficiently And that was in the estimates that we provided. And we're seeing that continue in all of our plans for the year, whether it be the level of coverage or -- and the level of homes passed in fiber, all those remain on track. So we feel really good about the progress. John Stankey : On Internet Air, Simon, look, it's performing well. It's got, as you know, in our view, certain segments that are most attractive to that. I like the product of the business segment, and we're certainly having some success with that. It's going to be key for us in certain parts of our consumer segment as we move through the next phase of our cost reduction efforts, it is a means for us to begin finding a good catch to shut down other infrastructure and still serve customers. So, we will use it surgically and selectively that will help us both on the cost side as well as retaining valuable customers where we think we can have the right kind of network capacity that will support the product going forward. We still have a little bit of scaling to do. I'm not quite satisfied with the self-install rates yet on it, but that's not problematic stuff that's typical when we're kind of scaling the product and putting it out there in the first line. We'll work through those things as we always do. So the foundation is there to use it the right way. I'm excited about having that tool. It's certainly going to help us in managing some of our installed base and in particular, help us kind of make the transition out of some of our legacy infrastructure that we'll need over time. Simon Flannery : And any thoughts on 2024 in terms of POP coverage and overall CapEx levels? John Stankey : We'll give you guidance on 2024 as we typically do later part of this year, and we'll detail all that out. But as you can see, from all the progress we've made and what's going on right now, we're really satisfied that we've got the right kind of machine to build the way we want to build and the network is performing in a great way and all of our indicators back from our customers, they're very satisfied with the level of experience they have. So everything, I think, feels pretty good about that right now. Pascal Desroches : Yes. Simon, just to be clear, I said it in my commentary. We are past peak investment as we exit this year. And we'll give our guidance at the same time as we usually do. But clearly, we don't expect to be at the levels of capital you've seen us invest in 2022 and 2023. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hi. Thank you. First just a little more direct one of Simon's questions. Where are you on the deployment of 3 gigahertz spectrum for 5G across your sell sites? And then a bigger question. Can you talk about the 2Q seasonality in the fiber business? Is this more gross add or churn driven? And do you now expect positive seasonality in the third quarter? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Phil, Good morning. Through the end of the second quarter, we are at around $175 million POPs covered, well on track to deliver on the $200 million we had guided to earlier in the year. John Stankey : And look, I don't think I'd characterize second quarter's seasonality per se. I think I've been pretty clear, Phil, on, one, we had a significant account migration issue to both of our significant competitors rejiggered their offers in the market, which drove some shift in share. And I expect we'll probably see more normalized things now. As you know, there's device introductions that occur in the latter part of the year that certainly drives the seasonality of the upgrade cycle. And typically in 3Q, there's always that question of exactly what month that happens in. Does it happen in the end of 3Q or does it get pushed into 4Q? And we'll all probably find out about the same time on that as to what happens in this year's cycle that sometimes can move some numbers in 3Q and 4Q, but those are usually directly tailorable to the offer that's in the market. And on a year-over-year basis that could impact things that there's a difference of what happens in 2023 versus 2024 as well as how different the devices are that are offered if that spikes a little bit of activity. Philip Cusick : Sorry, John, I wasn't clear. I was asking about the fiber a little bit softer in the second quarter? John Stankey : I'm sorry Phil. Philip Cusick : Seasonally stronger. John Stankey : Yes. So yes, there is that seasonal movement in fiber and broadband and I apologize for misunderstanding your question. There is probably two things driving it. One is, you probably heard from others in the industry, there is less move activity going on in general. And that has had a degree of impact. There is the seasonal dynamic that occurs in some of the out for college and university work as well. I expect that things are probably going to continue to be a bit softer in the market, because I don't expect that we're going to see housing movement necessarily recover. I don't -- I think it's an artifact of mortgage rates and people's ability to make those discretionary moves. But look, I feel really comfortable about our ability to continue to add along the clip that we're adding right now, because we're more dependent on share take than we are on mover activity. And that's a little bit different for us than maybe others in the market that don't necessarily have the share take opportunity that we have. So I don't think you're going to see further slowing on what we've kind of witnessed in the second quarter. And I think you will see a little bit of a seasonality uptick that's going to come with what typically happens in third quarter, but it will be a bit muted, because I expect that there's going to be a little bit less movement activity in the housing market. Philip Cusick : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi. Good morning. Just curious if you can give us an update on your longer-term thoughts of where you want to see your fiber and broadband footprint relative to your historic ILEC footprint? And how you're thinking about the programs such as [indiscernible] and ACP influencing those longer-term aspirations? John Stankey : Michael. Good morning. So look, we've done an awful lot of work, and we have a pretty good line of sight. And I've used this characterization before, and I don't think it's a whole lot different. It will vary state by state, but there is an easy business case to be made on reinvestment in infrastructure around, call it, two-third of the footprint. And typically, when you get into outside plant investment, the way the cycle typically starts as a new technology comes out or a new architecture you see the first third as being attractive, and that kind of starts the process. And as you get up the learning curve and technology scales and prices come down and the market matures, you end up getting to a point where the second third starts to look very attractive and you end up investing and going through. And then, it really depends market by market. Sometimes it's the final third that becomes the question around whether or not there is merit for investment. And sometimes, it's the final 20%, somewhere in that range. And I think that's effectively where we're going to be into your question, that's where the issue of subsidy will play out. We've been pretty specific in our analysis of looking at, I'll call it, that final third. I'm generalizing grossly. But I'll call it that final third of saying where is it that we think we would like to try to be really competitive and build that infrastructure out because it's strategically injects the position that other areas that we serve or we think the growth characteristics of that market will be good over time or we have a good existing base of customers or it's complementary to our wireless business. There's a lot of different parameters we look at, but we have a point of view on where we think we'd like to compete for that. And we intend to go into the process and lean into that and try to compete. That doesn't mean we're going to win it. I expect there'll be others that look at some markets and there'll be places where we're interested and somebody else is interested. We try to be informed in thinking about how other competitors might think about those markets, given how they line up to their footprint and where they have business interest. And hopefully, we'll be an informed bidder and will be successful, and we'll be able to put a compelling case moving forward. I feel like we have a lot of tools at our disposal to be very competitive in the process. And I've talked about what those are. We have a lot that we can do in terms of our presence in communities. We've got great labor constructs. We've been working with our vendors on a lot of US and American-based content. In our infrastructure and equipment, we're putting out a fantastic technology that people view as being superior and better. So I think we're going to be very competitive in the places we want to be competitive, but it remains to be seen how much of that we win. I would then go ahead and tell you, my expectation is, this process is going to unfold in 2024. Awards probably are going to be not the types of things that you're going to see impact 2024's business. We'll be in the regulatory process and bidding. I would expect when we start thinking about what we win and where we have success, you will see us incorporate those conclusions into our 2025 and beyond kind of view of the business. And I'd like to get through a couple of the larger states to see how successful we are before I start to frame and characterize that for you moving forward. Is that healthy enough? Michael Rollins : Yes, that's very helpful. And just maybe one other sub-question that, does fixed wireless play a different role than you previously described in your broadband aspirations? John Stankey : No. I mean, as I previously described it as -- and I gave a characterization earlier is that, look, there will be some parts of the United States that are best served by fixed wireless, at least, I believe that they will be best served by fixed wireless. As I move around different states, I think there are some states who believe that's the case. And there are some states that are looking at how do you get as many people on the Internet as quickly as possible at the highest economic return. And those states that have that point of view, I think, we will probably support fixed wireless awards. Now, I will tell you, not all 50 states necessarily have that viewpoint. In some cases, I think there are policymakers in certain states who are maybe biased more terrestrial infrastructure. And I don't know how that plays out. My guess is, they run out of money before they serve everybody based on the amount of money that's available in subsidy and what's out there, but time will tell whether they stick to their guns on that or maybe slightly revised their approach as they start to see bids coming in. But I do expect there'll be places where economically fixed wireless is the optimum solution to get good solid Internet out as quickly as possible that will sustain things for a period of time. And I expect there'll be parts of our footprint. World be a very good catch product for us, where we don't maybe see either subsidy coming in or the business case to invest in fiber for those customers for the next couple of decades. And then thirdly, as I've said before, there are segments in the business market today that have very different use characteristics than a consumer household that tends to be pretty bandwidth-intensive, doing a lot of entertainment streaming, growing consumption at 30% and 40% a year. You don't see those kind of dynamics showing up in some of the small business and lower end of the midsize market and fixed wireless is a solution for those customers that can use that kind of service, especially when they need to marry it with mobile services to complement their business is a very attractive place for us to be thinking about using the product and the infrastructure, and I like the yields on that. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Thanks for taking the question. I guess it has to be me that's going to ask this question. John, and I'm sure you have a bunch of talking points in front of you. So, the lead situation. So in the last 50 or 70 years, has there been a federal state or municipal organization that's ever flagged this issue to AT&T that put it on the radar screen in a way that maybe we all should have known about? And then second, has there ever been a material amount of claims that somehow people were harmed by the existence of this lead in your network? And then people are throwing numbers around. When you talk to the credit rating agencies, what do they think? How do you talk about this issue to them and what it means to your leverage situation? And then finally, how does this issue affect how you think about capital allocation of the dividend? Thanks John Stankey : So Dave, thanks for asking the question that I guess, needed to be asked. I'm limited in how much I can say. I'll try to be somewhat responsive to share. But if you are unsatisfied with a little bit of the background I give here, I apologize, but you also have to understand we're in a unique position that we do have actual litigation pending right now on some of this out in Lake Tahoe, and that maybe puts us in a little bit different place. So I need to be somewhat sensitive around that. So, let me start at the back end, and then I'll try to tick through. I don't think it changes my point of view of how I think about the dividend. I don't -- that hasn't come into characterization right now. When I go through your questions, we've had relationships with federal state regulators on all safety issues for a very long time. Lead being one of them, we work with our workplace regulators, we work with external environmental regulators. And as you know, we are a big company and we do an awful lot. We work with a variety of different substances and materials that are regulated, and we have infrastructure inside of our business of health and safety organizations that do this stuff professionally, and it's been part of the DNA of our business. We have those relationships, we communicate, we share data. I think as you know, we provide health plans to an awful lot of employees, and we pay attention to whether or not our employees are doing well on a variety of things, and we care about whether or not they're healthy or if we're spending money, fixing things, why are things broken in people's health. That's been a virtuous cycle or something that we spend a lot of time and energy on, it\u2019s just part of the DNA of our business. And I think to answer your question, and those normal cycles and those interactions as anybody come in and said, \"Hey, we've got issues around what you're doing with lead cables or you're not handling this correctly\u201d. The answer is no. Have we -- as part of that rigorous enforcement that goes on, have we had circumstances where compliance with a particular thing maybe has popped up, and we've had to go in and demonstrate compliance or do things, of course. That's what regulators do, and that's what workplace safety people do. And I think we're proud of our track record and what we've been able to do. And I think the constructive relationship that we have with our labor union around workplace safety and the fact that we're constructively working through this issue with them right now is indicative of something that's been in place and has just been kind of the DNA of what we do. We haven\u2019t disclosed anything out publicly about claims, because there hasn't been anything material to disclose is what I would tell you. And I don't know that I would go any further than that. And the way we're talking to credit agencies around this issue is exactly how we're talking to you about it. So, I don't think there's anything we've shared with them in context that we haven't given to them, it's any different than what we shared with you right now. David Barden : Okay, John. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Peter Supino : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about Consumer Wireline segment margins. Thinking about the longer run, could you just update us on the time line for legacy network shutdowns? And are there permanent differences between the long-term heading of your margins in that business and those of pure-play broadband businesses? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Peter. We haven't given, what I will call, a characterization of the \"shutdown\" because I don't think you should necessarily think about the shutdown as like a date certain that arrives, that date will arrive. But we think about it as kind of a rolling process. We think about it as a geography by geography or ZIP code by ZIP code process. And when you think about how our cost structure is aligned to that business as you begin to modernize infrastructure and ultimately not have to support products, services of infrastructure of older legacy generations, then costs start to fall away. We've done an awful lot of work separating out the variable and fixed cost structure in the, what I will call, semi-fixed cost structure to know what we need to do as we roll through geographies to ultimately get at the layers of fixed, semi-fixed and variable. And so, I don't think it's as important about saying what is the date that you're no longer offering the entire totality of products and services as much as what is the progress you're making in working through the areas where those products and services still exist. And as you heard in my opening remarks, we now have catch products showing up in the market that allows us to begin accelerating that work. That work is part and parcel of some of the recommitment of $2 billion over three years that we expect we're going to be able to take out. I do believe that as we simplify given how we allocate costs in the business and our reporting, the company and we start to shutter some of that square mileage, yes, that's going to help contribute to accretion back into the margin structure of the going-forward broadband business in our consumer markets. And I believe the day that we arrive at ultimately exercising all those costs from the business what I know about how our fiber infrastructure is performing on a stand-alone basis right now. It's all goodness. In fact, this week, I was out with our network operations team, and it was just such an uplifting day for somebody who's worked in the company as long as I have to see the cost structure that's been put in place, the customer satisfaction that's occurring, the efficiency of the technician ranks, the durability of what's going into service. I mean it's all good. And as a result of that, when you step back from this day, should we be able to operate this business once we ultimately move our way out of some of the embedded cost structure in a perfectly competitive characterization of the rest of the industry. The answer is yes, I have confidence we can get to that. Peter Supino : Thank you very much [indiscernible] Amir Rozwadowski : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. The fiber ARPU is up pretty nicely year-over-year. Still a little bit below market. Can you give us an idea of why that is just a higher number of customers newer on promos? And where do you think that can go in the next 12 months? And of the 25 million locations you have passed with fiber, how many of those are included in this latest 15 million homes that you have passed? And where will that total be when that project is completed? Thank you. John Stankey : I'm sorry, Frank, could you rephrase the second part of that question again, so I just kind of -- you clipped a bit. Frank Louthan : Sorry, you disclosed -- I think you had 25 million locations passed with fiber. I assume some of that is the latest 15 million home push that you have. Can you give us an idea of where you are in building out to those 15 million locations? And what will that total number be when that final project is finished? John Stankey : Yes. So we haven't changed any of our guidance, Frank, on 30 million locations passed by 25 million. And I may be not understanding the subtlety of your question. I think we just told you we passed in the remarks, 20 million locations -- so we're -- am I missing what you're asking there? Frank Louthan : Well, I'm just trying to figure out the 15 million homes that you've passed that last project, where are you today on that project? How many more do you have left in that 50 million of build? Pascal Desroches : Frank, I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say the 15 million. Just to be clear, right now, between business and consumer we are passing around 24 million homes and with the vast majority of that, obviously, being consumers. And as John alluded to, our plans haven't changed. We feel really good about the pace at which we're building. And when we build, we feel really good about the take rates that we're seeing. So all in all, these things are pursuing according to our plan. John Stankey : On the ARPU side, Frank, we've historically been a bit under the industry. Part of it is the maturity of our base of customers. We have, what I would call, tenure-wise a little bit less established base than maybe the incumbent players. And so, if you're a customer for a longer period of time and you move up a continuum that obviously helps the ARPU. But some of it is deliberate. We're, I think, priced in the market in a way, as you are probably aware, we're trying to do everyday simple pricing where we don't use promotions, and we tend to get a little bit more at the front end as a result of that and maybe a little bit less at the back end on the average side and the fact that when you're penetrating having a competitive price point is, I think, helpful in getting that faster penetration at the front end quicker, which is a driver of return in the overall investment. And then finally, we're doing a lot of work where we're trying consolidated products and services and doubling up households on both wireless and fixed broadband and those are really attractive households to get. They're really attractive customers to get. And I think when we have a good high-quality product, we don't have to discount a lot, but we want an offer between both the wireless and the broadband product to make sure we're at a price point that we think holds that household. And that strategy has been working. And I think it plays into some of our pricing strategy as a result of that, but you're really highlighting a point that is why we have so much confidence in this business. We continue to have an umbrella to work under and that's a good thing, and it allows us to make sure we can continue to grow ARPUs and grow with those customers. And as I said earlier, when you run a subscription business, you juris those things and you use them very carefully, and we'll continue to use it very carefully as we move forward. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Frank. Operator, that's all the time we have for questions. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today and today's teleconference call. We'd like to thank you for using our service and have a wonderful day.

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Mr. Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO, and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor Statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information, including our earnings materials, are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir, and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us. At the start of this year, we articulated a plan in which our deliberate investment in 5G and fiber would help grow our customer base in a profitable manner. Strong results we share today represent the latest proof that our strategy is working and sets us up for continued sustainable and profitable growth. We're meeting rising data demand with best-in-class 5G and fiber solutions. This is not only expanding our durable customers. 5G and fiber solutions. This is not only expanding our durable customer base, but also delivering attractive returns. The results we're seeing only strengthen our conviction in continuing to invest to bring these next generation technologies to even more Americans. We're tracking in line to meet or beat our consolidated financial targets and we're raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance today. Our goal has been to invest and grow the business in a manner that progressively differentiates the AT&T asset base in our industry, and we're doing exactly that. In wireless, our consistent go-to-market approach continues to expand our base of high-value subscribers. Our results show that our best deal for everyone approach continues to resonate with customers. For example, in September, we saw the strongest iPhone pre-orders we've had in many years, despite competing promotions with higher subsidies allowing lower value device trade-ins. This is a testament to both the simplicity of our offers and the strength of our consistent and straightforward value proposition, as well as the quality of our network. The tail of the tape is clear. Customers are staying with us longer and spending more with us. Just take a look at our consistent low churn, increasing ARPUs, and improving returns. Why? Because we're providing more value to customers. For example, the vast majority of people taking our iPhone promotions are signing up for our highest value plans, even though it's not a promo requirement. In fact, our highest value unlimited plan is our fastest growing plan. In addition, our network has never been better in terms of its size and quality as we continue to enhance the largest wireless network in North America and expand the nation's most reliable 5G network. It's no surprise that when you combine our high-value customer growth and rising revenues per user, we continue to grow profits in our wireless business as evidenced by our highest ever EBITDA on record. Turning to fiber, the story remains the same. Where we build fiber, we win. We win by delivering the undisputed best broadband solution on the planet, improving our brand position, gaining broadband share, and by improving our mobile share. Our strategy is working. We just delivered nearly 300,000 high quality net adds this quarter against a muted backdrop of household move activity. In addition, the returns on our fiber investment continue to improve from our initial assumptions. We're exceeding our expectations for penetration in new markets. Additionally, the accretive mix shift to higher value fiber plans has driven our fiber ARPU up nearly 9% year-over-year. Look no further than how fiber is fueling a surge in broadband revenue growth. Consumer Wireline has transformed from a declining business to one that is delivering strong, consistent growth. We offer a superior product that has room to improve on all the levers that drive margin performance as we scale. No matter where we put fiber, we're the preferred broadband provider. In August, we selectively launched AT&T Internet Air, our fixed wireless product. We view this service as yet another tool in our connectivity toolbox. While it will primarily act as a targeted catch product, we've been pleased with the positive early reception and have already added about 25,000 subscribers, pushing us back into positive territory for overall net broadband growth of 15,000 subscribers in the quarter. Meanwhile, we're only in the very early stages of reaping the long-term benefits from the inevitable convergence of 5G and fiber. Where we've deployed fiber, we're seeing an uptick in Mobility growth. Additionally, AT&T customers with fiber and wireless service have our lowest churn and the highest lifetime values to match. As the one player scaling both wireless and fiber networks, we're well positioned to be the provider of choice for the ubiquitous connectivity that consumers want. And importantly, we're positioned to do this at the lowest unit economic costs, establishing a long runway for sustainable returns. To enhance our network capabilities, we're powering experiences built for the high speed connected everywhere world we now live in. One example is our work with Cisco to deliver the next evolution in collaboration for those working on the go. By tapping into the fast speeds and low latency of 5G, we've seamlessly extended Webex Calling capabilities to mobile phones, simplifying connectivity for a mobile workforce. We feel strongly that this is just the beginning of what's possible. At the same time that we're reinvigorating customer growth, we are also operating more efficiently across our business. This is a core component of the 120 basis point margin improvement we saw in adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2022. You can also see the benefits of our $1.5 billion of incremental cash from operations over the first three quarters compared to the same period a year ago. We're off to a strong start as we execute on our plan to generate $2 billion plus of incremental cost savings within the next three years and we're confident in our ability to achieve this goal. We're executing our legacy wireline transformation as we scale our 5G and fiber networks. Over time, we expect this evolution to drive significant operating efficiencies as we sunset legacy infrastructure that no longer meets our customers' needs. We're also aligning our operating footprint and work environment to mirror our streamlining focus on 5G and fiber. These steps are important enablers to further improve our collaboration, eliminate organizational redundancies, and fully utilize the innovative technologies that improve how we work. And while we're still in the very early stages of Generative AI, we're already seeing tangible AI-driven improvements in productivity and cost savings. Measurable progress has been made with lowering customer support costs, unlocking software development efficiencies, and improving our network design effectiveness. We expect these capabilities to play a key role in our continued efforts to achieve our future cost savings objectives. This takes us to the final priority, and that's how we're putting our improving operating leverage to work. In the third quarter, we reduced our net debt by more than $3 billion and are on track to achieve our 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA target by the first half of 2025. Less net debt allows us to continue investing in AT&T's durable connectivity businesses and enhance our ability to deliver additional shareholder returns once we reach our long-term target. Our focus remains steady on allocating capital to create best-in-class experiences for customers, drive sustainable, profitable growth, and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Over the last few years, our investment-led strategy has delivered tangible benefits to, and financial returns from, our growing and high-value customer pool in both Mobility and broadband. We've expanded our nationwide 5G network and are on track to reach 200 million people or more with mid-band 5G spectrum by the end of the year. We're also on track to pass 30 million plus fiber locations by the end of 2025. We now have about 24 million fiber locations that we're able to serve on our network with additional opportunities to provide service through our Gigapower joint venture with BlackRock or BEAD funding opportunities. Given the returns we're seeing, we continue to believe leaning into attractive return profile of 5G in the fiber business make good strategic and economic sense. At the same time, we remain committed to our dividend payout level and expect its credit quality to consistently improve. In fact, we've already generated more than enough cash to meet our annualized dividend even before the fourth quarter, which is generally our highest cash generation quarter. Demand for better and faster broadband connectivity is growing exponentially. With the largest wireless network in North America and as the nation's largest fiber Internet provider, we're providing best-in-class 5G and fiber services to meet that demand. It's clear the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger, and they'll only grow stronger as we continue to scale our networks, simplify our customers' connected lives, and deepen our engagement with them. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John discussed, we're driving great returns on our 5G and fiber investments, as you can see on Slide 5. The favorable trend in our wireless and broadband businesses continue. We're growing subscribers, ARPUs and margins in both wireless and broadband and we're taking out costs. Our strategy is working and gives us confidence to raise guidance today. I will discuss this in more detail later on. Now, let's move to our third quarter financial summary on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues were up 1% in the third quarter, largely driven by growth in wireless service and fiber revenues. These increases were partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline. Adjusted EBITDA was up 4.6% for the quarter with growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline in Mexico. This was partially offset by an expected decrease in Business Wireline. In fact, due to our increased revenue growth and overachievement in cost savings, we now expect to grow adjusted EBITDA by better than 4% versus our prior guides of 3% plus. Adjusted EPS was $0.64 compared to $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. This includes about $0.08 of non-cash aggregated EPS headwinds from lower pension credits, lower capitalized interest, higher effective tax rate, and lower DIRECTV equity income, all of which we expected. Cash from operating activities was $10.3 billion in the quarter and $26.9 billion year-to-date. This is an increase of $1.5 billion year-to-date, primarily driven by higher receipts due to revenue growth and lower disbursements, including personnel costs and device payments. This growth comes at the same time as we saw a lower year-over-year net impact of receivable sales of about $1 billion year-to-date and higher cash taxes of about $350 million year-to-date. This shows the underlying strength of the organic cash flow occurring in our business. Capital investment was $5.6 billion in the quarter and this reflects continued historically high levels of investments in 5G and fiber. We expect to move past elevated capital investment levels as we exit the year. We feel really good about free cash flow of $5.2 billion in the quarter. Through the first three quarters, our free cash flow was $10.4 billion, up $2.4 billion versus the same period a year ago. We're also now tracking to about $16.5 billion free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to our Mobility results on the next slide. Looking at our Mobility results, postpaid phone net adds were 468,000. Total revenues and operating income in our largest business unit are at all-time highs. Revenues were up 2% and service revenues were up 3.7%. These gains were driven by subscriber growth and higher postpaid phone ARPU. Year-to-date wireless service revenues have grown 4.6% and we continue to feel really good about the performance of our wireless business. Mobility EBITDA was up 7.6% in the quarter. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.99, up $0.32 year-over-year. The primary drivers of ARPU growth are higher ARPUs on legacy plans, a continued mix shift to higher value rate plans with higher margins, and continued improvement in consumer international roaming trends. Postpaid phone churn remains low at 0.79% for the quarter. This continued low wireless churn shows our value proposition is resonating with customers. In prepaid, we had 26,000 phone net additions with total churn of 2.78% with Cricket churn substantially lower. Let's move to the next slide and our wireline results. Our fiber investment is driving Consumer Wireline growth and strong returns. We added 296,000 fiber customers in the quarter. The consistency of fiber's appeal continues to shine as we've now added more than 200,000 fiber net ads for 15 straight quarters. We've also seen measurable improvement in fiber churn year-over-year despite recent pricing actions. This highlights the superior product and experience that customers consistently receive with fiber. Strong fiber revenue growth of about 27% drove total broadband revenues up nearly 10% year-over-year. Fiber ARPU was $68.21, up about 9%. Customers are increasingly choosing faster speed tiers, which is also supporting ARPU growth. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 9.4% on the strength of fiber revenue growth. Given the better-than-expected broadband revenues we've achieved so far this year, we now expect to deliver 7% plus broadband revenue growth for the year. Additionally, our AT&T Internet Air product is off to a solid start. As we expand our service to select new markets, we're confident it will serve as a strong catch product as we continue to sunset our legacy copper services. Turning to Business Wireline, EBITDA was down $268 million year-over-year. Overall, Business Wireline remains in transition as we move from offering legacy products to next-generation connectivity products. If you take a step back, the overall picture of our business franchise looks somewhat different when you include the increasing strategic importance of business wireless to these very same accounts. Wireless service revenue is up 7% benefiting from continued growth in postpaid wireless subscribers and connected devices. As the transition to electric vehicles continues, we expect a tailwind from our consistent success in connected cars since EVs consume more data bandwidth. Connectivity solutions are also growing in the high single digits due to momentum with fiber as we make it available for more small to medium-sized businesses. And total business solutions year-to-date EBITDA is down slightly year-over-year as growth in wireless is largely offsetting declines in wireline. At the end of the day, we see the same underlying trends we've seen year-to-date with Business Wireline EBITDA, and we now expect low double-digit declines for the full year. Now before I close, I'd like to quickly provide an update on the progress we're making on improving the flexibility of our balance sheet. As a result of our strong cash generation, we're on track to achieve our net debt reduction target for the year. In addition to debt reduction and liability management we discussed last quarter, we have also incrementally reduced our short-term direct supplier and vendor financing obligations in the third quarter, and we expect to continue to do so in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the paydown of these obligations is a headwind to free cash flows. We are reducing these liabilities in a high interest rate environment, which will help contain our cash interest costs. Therefore, I'm really pleased that we're doing this while still exceeding our initial free cash flow targets for the year. In addition, lowering our financing obligations should enable a more radical quarterly cadence of our free cash flow in 2024. As we think about our debt maturity towers for the next two years, we feel we are in a solid position and expect to address near-term maturities as they come due with cash on hand. We had more than $9 billion of cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits on hand at the end of the quarter. In this high-rate environment, we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to earn more on this cash than the cost of our long-term debt. It is also important to remember that more than 95% of our long-term debt is fixed at an average rate of 4.2% and a weighted average maturity of 16 years. The financial structure I've outlined improves our financial flexibility and ensures we remain in an advantageous position with respect to our cost of capital. Our expectations for growing free cash flow and reducing our debt as it comes do only further improve that position. To close, I'd just like to emphasize that I could not be happier with what our team has achieved this year. We are very pleased with our operating results as our business fundamentals are largely exceeding our expectations. As John mentioned, we articulated the plan in which we expected to grow customers in a profitable manner, and we're on track to deliver just that. That concludes my remarks this morning. Let me hand it over to Amir to open it up for Q&A. Amir? Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much, Pascal. Operator, we'll take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. Two, if you don't mind. The first one is, I was hoping we could get your early insights on what drives the uptake of Internet Air, the demo where it's resonating. And I'm also curious how you are deciding which of your in-region markets where it makes sense to launch that product and maybe whether you're starting to reconsider whether there's opportunities to identify the same condition out of region. And then just a question for Pascal, I'm curious why you did not increase your adjusted EPS guidance for the year in conjunction with your EBITDA guidance? Thank you. John Stankey : Good morning, Brett. Nothing's changed on our approach to Internet Air. I think I'd start with the second part of your question, and I'm going to articulate exactly how we see the product being used within our business moving forward. So we don't necessarily distinguish that there's application of the product out of region just as there is in region, although they're a little bit different. I've said before, I have no issues selling Internet Air into the business segment. It's a really attractive thing for us to do. It's a really helpful product on a number of different fronts that meets a particular need. I've shared with you that given what businesses pay for broadband and the other incremental services you can layer on top of them that allows them to have a higher take or a higher ARPU and their usage characteristics that makes the profitability of serving the product in that segment different than it is in, say, a consumer household with four people that's streaming video all day long. And so we will continue to find opportunities to do that. We have some markets out of region where we're under-penetrated. We have a lot of [network-valued] (ph) capacity that we can use. And we'll selectively look at opportunities to do that, where it makes sense to do that. I wouldn't tell you that's the dominant driver in region and where we've been putting a lot of time and energy. We start with our customers first. We have a lot of longstanding loyal customers that have been with us. They've been buying bundled services from us, and we can give them a better service on Internet Air than we could possibly on the existing infrastructure that's in place, that is generally going to be infrastructure that we're going to be replacing in fairly short order with fiber. And so as a holding strategy, we may apply the product in that case to hold that customer with a better service experience because they're a high value customer. It allows us to move into our process of shutting down infrastructure in places where we need to ultimately pull out costs and shutter network and infrastructure, and it becomes a tool in allowing us to do that. And so that's how we intend to use it, and we'll use it, as I said, on a very careful, surgical and targeted basis, but it really hasn't changed our point of view on the product in aggregate. And Pascal can touch on the EPS issue, which I think is a pretty simple explanation. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Brett. Here's what I would say first and foremost, don't read too much into this. We couldn't be happier with the performance of the overall company. And remember, when we gave EPS guidance, we gave a pretty broad [indiscernible] range. I think it's fair to say we are tracking towards the upper end of that range. But there's more variability in things like capitalized interest, non-cash pensions. So it's really just a question on our part, but all in all, we feel really good about the overall performance of the business. Brett Feldman : Great. Thanks for that, color. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. Good morning. I wonder if we could dig into the fiber and the broadband growth, that 9% ARPU growth is very impressive. Can you disaggregate that a little bit more and help us understand what's the kind of the take-up of these higher-end tiers and how much further can this growth continue? And then perhaps talk a little bit about DIRECTV and how you see that evolving over time and how you are thinking about your various strategic options around that? John Stankey : Hi, Simon. I don't know if I'll be able to give you the exact number you want, but what I will tell you is the ARPU growth is being driven largely by migration into higher speed plans where customers are moving up in the continuum. Plus we've been managing the base of some of our embedded stuff at the low end with some pricing adjustments that we've made that's helped. So the spread from bottom to top of the customer base is a little tighter spread than it used to be in aggregate. But by and large, we've got customers that are choosing to migrate up on speed, and I would tell you, there's a long way for that to run, because as you know, as we're deploying today, at a minimum on the new build, we're putting in 5 gig networks. And so, we've got a lot of customers that have a lot of room to go from maybe their migration into a 1 gig product and ultimately moving up to a 2.5 or a 5 gig product as their needs adjust and when they decide they want to do that. So I would also tell you, when you look at where we're selling on average price per bid, relative to others in the industry, we tend to sell at a bit of a discount, which we're okay with right now. I've outlined before why we think that's a pretty decent strategy at this juncture and allows us to get the faster penetration the way we want to do it. And I think it's also going to help us as we move into some bundling strategies moving forward that it gives us a lot of opportunity and flexibility as to how we think about putting those products together without taking any margin erosion in the approach. So I feel really good that we've got a lot of headroom. I think I would also point out that on the expense side of the equation, we are still scaling. You see it happening each quarter, we're getting better, but in a lot of these metropolitan areas that we're building, we're not quite at optimal scale yet. That's where our build is focused as we move forward, which is to fill in and make sure that we get footprints and numbers of homes passed and workforce sizing that is kind of in an optimal structure. And when we do that, we take cost per down as a result of that. We take cost per down in our acquisition costs. We take cost per down in our ongoing maintenance costs. So you should also understand that from a margin accretion perspective, it's not just about driving the ARPU up, it's about us also getting more efficient and effective on the cost line of how we operate that business. On DTV, we're running the business incredibly well. It's generating the cash that our partnership was designed to generate. The team is very focused on what they're doing. The plan for the first two years that we've been in is basically not only tracked to what we expected, but is outperforming what we expected. I think the focus in that mature business has been really good. We're very satisfied with the trajectory of how it's operating. We're extremely satisfied with how the management team is executing the plan that we set up. They're very focused on what their mission is over the next couple of years. My point of view is we continue to run the play we set up, something else came along that made sense, fine, would examine it, but right now, our management team is focused on operating the business. Simon Flannery : Great, and any update on the BEAD process? John Stankey : Other than the wheels of government turn slowly, not really. It's in the process and we've been working actively. I would say there's a couple states that are a little bit further ahead than the other states in the country. If you want to call them bellwether, they're bellwether from the sense of that is they're getting ready to file and submit their applications. It's exposing a couple of the areas where clarification needs to occur in the process about how the regs are to be applied, how the bids are to be evaluated. That process of getting that clarification between the industry, broadly the state and the Federal government is underway and I think that's where the action is right now. That clarification will hopefully allow the states that are maybe second, third, fourth in the queue to be a little bit more precise in their applications, and I suspect that once some of these issues are resolved, there'll be a little less back and forth and a little bit more of the [rote] (ph), respond to the application and move forward. As I've said before, I'm not optimistic that there's customers that are paying monies on BEAD supported infrastructure builds that impact the 2024 financial plan. I think this is going to be a 2025 plus thing when you kind of look at the aggregate portions of the build, the private capital that comes in, and ultimately customers that come on the network and start buying services that might not have been buying services before. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. Two, if I could. First, first on wireless. Churn was flat sequentially despite the typical seasonality and continues to come down annually. I mean, just, John, just, what are you seeing in the competitive market? Obviously, a lot of concern about what's happening from cable and through other MVNOs. So just trends that you're seeing there and maybe does that suggest that the strength that we typically see in 4Q subs will continue? And then one more if I may on the free cash flow, looking out to \u201824, not looking for guidance at this point but anything you can tell us about the piece parts that will drive free cash flow versus the \u201823 levels next year like CapEx or anything you can tell us about working cap, EBITDA or even DIRECTV or tax payments would be great? Thanks. John Stankey : I'd be happy to have Pascal give you the non-answer on guidance for free cash flow next year, but -- I'm just kidding, John. We'll give you a little texture on it, I guess. On the wireless side, look, I think at the second quarter call last year, or last quarter, when we talked about where we were on our momentum in the market, we articulated what had occurred. We pointed back to specifically one particular account that we had had some churn and that drove a little bit of an anomaly. We indicated to you that we felt pretty good about our momentum in the market and that we expected a normalized third quarter in our performance. And I believe you can look at the tail of the tape here and see that there's a normalized third quarter in our performance and nobody else is reported, but from the best of what I can glean in our sensing mechanisms that are out of the market, we're kind of back into a ratable share position and I think that's actually a preferred position because the way we think about this is I'm actually more interested in growing our share of revenues as opposed to just our share of raw number of customers. And I think we're doing as good a job of that in the industry as anybody, we're bringing on highly accretive customers and we continue to see our share of industry revenues improve at a better rate than the share of our actual subscriber counts, which tells me that I think we're focused on those profitable customers and bringing in the right customers. I would tell you the churn numbers as you indicate them, we're very happy with them. They're very strong, they're very solid. So despite what's being reported by MVNOs or cable, our base is incredibly stable, and you can see what's happening on our growth side that's ultimately driving the net numbers. If you step back and think about that in aggregate, if we're growing ARPUs, and if we're growing accretive customers, and if our churn is stable, look, I think I'm okay with what's going on. I think that's a good formula. And when I think about where we get ready to approach the fourth quarter, we're kind of right on plan of what we expected to see happen. We're optimistic about the quarter. We think we're set up well in terms of our staffing levels, our positioning in the market, resources and supplies that we have. We think the product is a relevant product, so no matter what the economic environment is, I don't see anything that's going to necessarily impact the category. I think it's a very popular category for gift giving and what needs to go on. So I would expect we have a strong seasonal fourth quarter like we typically have in the industry and I don't see that changing right now. Pascal, do you want to give us some texture on free cash flow? Pascal Desroches : Sure thing. John, here are the things to keep in mind. We've said this all along. We're trying to build a franchise that is producing sustainable growth in both earnings and cash. We're confident we're going to be able to do that in 2024. So when you think about earnings, here are the piece parts to keep in mind. We continue to expect to grow our Mobility business very nicely as well as continue to drive growth in our fiber broadband business. Our cost takeout efforts the last couple of years have shown that we are committed to creating a really efficient cost structure. So all those things will help drive EBITDA growth and you couple that with a step-down in CapEx from the elevated levels we've been at in \u201822 and \u201823. Those are going to be the big growth drivers to drive both free cash flow growth next year. Offsetting that, we would anticipate DIRECTV contributions to decline along, consistent with the secular decline of that business. But I would say, keep in mind that that, DIRECTV probably -- it's probably more resilient than many have expected and the team is doing an incredible job managing that asset. And then we also expect with the phase-out of the 2017 tax incentives, bonus, appreciation, interest limitations, we're going to pay more taxes next year. Those are the big piece parts. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Maybe under the category of pushing my luck, on CapEx, it's been trending down through the year. The last few years you've actually had lower CapEx in the fourth quarter and vendor comments are that things are going to slow more. Should we be looking for a big bounce in the fourth quarter for some reason to get to $24 billion or maybe that is a little high at this point? John Stankey : Yeah, Phil, I'd be disappointed if you didn't try to push your luck, but I think we gave you guidance that said our CapEx for the year was going to mirror kind of what we did last year and I still think that's going to be our guidance. Our CapEx for the year is going to mirror what we did last year. So you should expect you're going to see something in the fourth quarter that delivers a number that reflects something very similar in the neighborhood of what we did last year. I've been telling you, I think, for several quarters that our goal is to get to a little bit more ratable construct around how we operate the business. We've been working hard to do that, meaning we smoothed some things out. We're not quite where we need to be in that regard yet, but we're getting better. So I think you need to be careful leaning extensively on seasonality because if we're doing our job right and we're doing all the right things and managing our working capital and those kinds of things, which I think we're getting progressively better at based on the comments that we gave you earlier, you may see seasonality start to adjust a little bit. Phil Cusick : If I can, one more. On the fiber side, how are you finding the business doing in terms of shaking customers out of cable given the low-move environment? Are you doing anything different to pull customers away or is this just sort of steadily working? John Stankey : We -- what I would say is, I'll maybe reframe your question. We're constantly evolving our tactics and our approach for how we take share. And we're constantly -- I think we're getting better and props to the marketing team that does this and the operating team that does the build. It's really a team effort frankly that occurs in these markets. There's no better way to sell the product than having -- digging up somebody's front yard, so to speak. So it builds awareness and then our job is to capitalize on that awareness and build excitement around it. And we've done an exceptional job at the front end of making that happen and we continue to fine-tune our tactics around that and that's what's led to faster rates of penetration. And it's a huge sensitivity driver in the overall financial performance of the investment. If you can double penetration rates in the first 18 months over what had been historic levels, it's amazing what that does to pay back effectively and we've been really successful at doing that. I think to give you a little color on your question, as we hit the 40% pen level in a market, which we're now getting more and more markets where we're kind of at that 40% share, 40% penetration level, our tactics do switch. And so, as more markets hit the 40% level, we have to go to a little bit different set of tactics around how we do that. And I think frankly in many instances, especially where those are in region, they play into our strengths in terms of how we drive more value into the household, how we use the bundling lever in an effective way, how we use data differently to target, what distribution channels we use to contact those customers shift as a result of that. So I would say we have a really fine-tuned set of plays that get us from 0 to 40%, and we're pretty good at doing that. And then when we hit 40%, we kind of start to use a different set of playbooks in those particular markets as they mature. And I feel really good that the team has their handle on that and they're doing it the right way. We spend the right money at the right time to unseat those customers and that's why you see that business scaling so nicely in the way that it is. Phil Cusick : Since you mention it, what is that first 18-month penetration at this point? John Stankey : So next question. Phil Cusick : Thank you. Bye, John. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Two, if I could as well. First, could you discuss the factors behind the slowing wireless device upgrade rate, how it's impacting the financials, and could this go even lower in the future? And then secondly, just an update on where AT&T is on the run rate cost cutting targets and if you could size the potential for additional savings over the next one to three years? John Stankey : Sure, Michael. So I would tell you that I don't think anything's really changed in what we see in the device rate, and whether or not it slows dramatically over what its current rate is. Hard to say. I would say the bias is, pick your view of what the economic environment does, and that's probably the higher correlation as to what happens to the upgrade rate. And, if there's a more stressed economic environment, maybe it slows a bit. If it stays healthy and robust and kind of perks along where we're at right now, then I don't think it's going to dramatically change. I think what we've been seeing in general is a couple things. I've mentioned this before in other calls and it doesn't change my point of view. The devices, frankly, from generation to generation change a little bit less. It's harder to get differentiation in the hardware. I mean, they're really good cameras on them and there's really good modems and they all have really good speed because of the spectrum bands they handle and so customers aren't necessarily hanging on a device evolution to say there's such a dramatic uptick in functionality that I can't use my device for several years. Two, I think people are -- the human body, the commercial case industry that is responsible for protecting devices, people are dropping them less and they're taking better care of them, and as a result of that, they last a little bit longer. You add onto that the fact that we're very successful at selling insurance into our customer base. Because we sell insurance, customers are more prone to potentially take a replacement device within the terms of their agreement that they have rather than swap out to a new device. And that has worked out well for customers and it works out well for us. And that tends to extend the life cycle a bit. And look, as devices get expensive -- more expensive, and they are getting more expensive, for whatever reason, consumers are rational animals, and like any other more expensive thing, oftentimes you keep it a little bit longer, you try to squeeze a little bit more out of it, and I think there's a cycle of that occurring. So I think that's why we're seeing the cycle we're seeing, whether it continues to thrive its way down or it kind of flattens out remains to be seen, but it's pretty explainable, and I don't think it's going to substantially alter kind of our point of view of momentum views for you and what we're looking at as we move forward. On the run rate on cost cutting that you ask about, look, the run rate is we did $6 billion over three years, right? And we did that in an inflationary environment, so it was really like, I would say it's 130% of what we really wanted to do when you think about what we were able to actually work through and get done. We've given you $2 billion more over the next three years. You saw that we took an accrual this quarter. That accrual is set up through the course of next year. I think if you want to understand how we expect some of these costs to go, there's probably a correlation to that accrual that you should think about. That's obviously not all of it, but it's a portion of it. It would give you some indication of how we think about feathering this in over the course of the next 12 months. And I would say, as I indicated in my opening remarks, we feel really good about where we are in momentum right now and some of the things we have underway. I mentioned to you many quarters ago that we've been investing in our information technology infrastructure, it's been painful, it requires a lot of work, it's very, very detailed work every time you change out a CRM system or billing system and you have to carefully deal with your customer base and your different distribution channels. We're now getting to the point where we're starting to turn some scale up on those platforms. That coupled with the fact that more of our activity is built on fiber and wireless is giving us a different kind of cost structure in the business. We're going to continue to ride that curve. We're going to continue to make sure that we streamline the business effectively for what we have as the new products moving forward. And that's part of the legacy migration and what we've been doing in geographic footprint shutdown. And I feel really good about us being able to achieve that $2 billion over the next three years. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Moffett : Hi, thank you. I want to stay with the topic you were just discussing about upgrade rates and things and just try to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of the new iPhone launch and what that might mean for margins in the fourth quarter. And then just a second question if I could just to clarify your remarks earlier on the BEAD program. As it does ramp up in what now sounds more likely to be 2025, would you expect that that would be, to some degree, a substitute for some of your fiber builds that are currently thought of as competitive overbuilds, or would they be a supplement to competitive overbuilds? John Stankey : So what I would tell you, Craig, is I've made some comments in my opening remarks that we had a pre-order rate in this cycle that was probably the best we've seen in a long period of time. And whether or not that's unique to AT&T or unique to the industry, I don't know. I have not heard others report at this juncture. I don't know what their guidance is going to be, but I will tell you that our upgrade rate was a bit higher than what we have seen in the last several quarters, but it wasn't what I would call out of pattern where it's going to be anything that is inconsistent with the guidance we've given you on our margins for the year and inconsistent with what we expect for the business performing. So everything that we have articulated to you where we would guide in on service revenue growth, what we think the operating margins are going to be within the business, our EBITDA performance is all still very much in check relative to what we see going on there. What I would say on BEAD is, I think it will depend. I think in some cases there could be some instances where there's a substitute in a state, but I think in some cases there could be some incremental. And a lot of it will depend on the nature of the particular build geographically where it's located and what our relative contribution is in it. And so I hate to give you such a soft answer, but the good news is it doesn't change anything we've guided you toward in \u201824. It doesn't change anything we're building now for \u201824. It doesn't change what we've committed to you for in \u201825 in terms of our commitment for the total number of fiber homes passed. If we find some incremental opportunities to go after, and if we win some, we won't know that until next year. We'll, of course, make some changes, but that's not going to be something that you're going to be seeing over the 18-month horizon in terms of what it does to our investment levels, sub-count levels, or anything like that. Craig Moffett : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, a big part of the growth that AT&T and the sector has enjoyed has come from the pricing lever. And you guys were early in calling out pricing as something that had to move to reflect inflation in the economy. But as you look ahead into 2024, given the realities of the cable industry's presence here now, and maybe the gravity that they represent from a pricing perspective, could you kind of opine a little bit on how you see the price lever being a part of the, kind of, short to medium term growth story for AT&T? And then maybe also, second question if I could, would be kind of any, obviously we just saw the new FCC net neutrality NPRM come out. I'm wondering if there's anything new in there that you see that you incrementally agree or disagree with, based on what we kind of went through with Wheeler on this topic? Thank you. John Stankey : You're really just trying to fire me up, aren't you? David Barden : Got to get you going in the morning, John. John Stankey : I guess. Here's how I kind of view the pricing issue. First of all, the industry has invested at an incredible level. If you kind of look, last year was a record investment level for the wireless industry. It's entirely possible, obviously don't know yet, but I look at trends that are going on, it's entirely possible this year could be pretty close to that as well. And so it's not a surprise to me in a rational industry when investment levels are up like that, that there's a desire to make sure that everybody's getting a return on these massive investments they're making and the incredible performance that they're putting out in these networks and the value that's driving into the consumer experience. And so I step back from that and say, is it perfectly reasonable with what I see going on with the industry in general and other players in the market, understanding that that value equation is customers are getting more speed, more reliability, greater capability, that that value exchange needs to be adjusted a little bit. And I see that happening. And I see it happening in a lot of different quarters in a lot of different ways, and sometimes it manifests itself in a exchange for value, giving, because there's more capacity out there, giving people more free things and more hotspots for an incremental amount of money. Sometimes it's looking at those that are maybe at the ratio of how much they're using to how much they're paying need to be hit a little bit as a result of it. But I see a lot of rational moves in that regard and I think as the market continues to mature, the industry, from my point of view, has shown that it can do that in a fairly effective way. And I look at things like customer satisfaction and utility and use, and all those things are headed in the right direction. So I'm going to conclude that it's being done in a fairly smart way and I look at, I know my numbers and I look at my churn numbers and my churn numbers are really, really good. We're really pleased in that regard. And so to me it's like there is plenty of places to navigate and look at this and do it strategically if you're experienced in managing a subscription base, which I think that we are, and I think we've done over time. Cable is running the play that they're running. They're attacking a particular segment of the market that they want to attack. I'm a person that kind of use things long term and structurally, and as I've said before, I don't think it's a sustainable strategy to be the low cost or price leader in a market when you're on a variable cost structure. And so, ultimately, there's some repricing. It's a little bit lumpy at times in this industry. We know that that's the case, but ultimately there's a repricing that goes on. And our job is to play for the long haul, and that's why we're focused on accretive, profitable growth, looking for the right customers, the ones that want to stay with us. And I think we're doing just fine in that regard, and if you get those customers that really understand the value that you bring to the equation, you shouldn't have a problem adjusting pricing on that value as you work through the evolution of your product. So, on to your second question. The United States demonstrated coming through the pandemic that it had one of the best and most scalable broadband infrastructures in the world, both at home and at business, and where other regions of the world were doing silly and crazy things, we relocated massive amounts of work and shifted massive amounts of traffic on wireless networks from the urban core during the days to the suburban residential dwellings and we shifted video from workplaces to home and we performed remarkably well and that's indicative, I think, of what has been very sound and good policy driving investment in infrastructure in this country. We\u2019re -- as I just said, coming off a record investment year in wireless infrastructure. If you look at fiber, there is -- I've never seen the amount of private capital and money that's going into fiber builds right now around the United States that are incenting more infrastructure builds on that side. We just passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act not only dealt with the underserved, but it had a component in there for affordability of the underserved. And I think what's most important to understand is while the government's putting up $43 billion, $44 billion for that, private capital will probably match that to the tune of about $100 billion. You could have $150 billion of investment going in to solve the underserved and unconnected problem. There's more choice every day in the broadband industry. There's no indications that in the ISP segment there's any discrimination going on. We have an industry in aggregate, that supports no blocking, no paid prioritization, no throttling, contrary to what we see going on with some platform apps that are out there that are choosing to do some of those things and how they operate their business. The ISP industry is, I think, the last of customers' concern. No customers are complaining about what's going on in that front. So why we would use taxpayer money and resources and political capital to chase a problem that doesn't exist is a bit of a mystery to me. Chasing an unnecessary partisan issue when we have bipartisan issues -- potential bipartisan issues like what is a competitive spectrum policy for the United States and how do we reauthorize spectrum authority so that we can keep pace with places like China and have a growing economic environment and great innovation, how do we deal with the fact that we have a broken universal service process that is so important for those that can't afford their services to make sure that it's sustainable. These are bipartisan issues that need to be dealt with and solved, and I think that's where regulators should be spending their time. Now, having said that, I think the facts are pretty clear. We will participate in the process with the FCC constructively. We're going to bring all this data to bear. We're going to demonstrate that this is in fact how the markets are operating. Hopefully, there's reasonable individuals that take that, get a good reading of it, understand it, and decide to set policy consistent with that, that that reality ultimately results in rational policy, and we see a reasonable outcome on that, and I haven't given up hope that that could be the case. However, if what we end up is a heavy-handed approach of taking early 1900s regulation and applying it against the Internet and using it as a government influence to something that's working just fine in the public markets, I will tell you as a company, we will do everything we need to do to ensure that the record reflects what the law allows the regulator to do and what the record supports. So that's kind of where I'm at on it at this juncture. David Barden : Thanks, John. I appreciate the comments. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks, operator. We've got time for one last question. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. On the business side, can you characterize the decline year-over-year in terms of whether, how much of that is weighted to slower or sort of weaker business environment versus exiting unprofitable or low margin products? And then secondly, on the international roaming contribution, where are we on that relative to sort of pre-pandemic levels as far as its contribution to wireless ARPU, and when does that comp start to get a little harder? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Frank. On the business side, here's how I would kind of rank the overall impact. One, the most significant impact that is occurring in the fixed wireline business is what I will call the secular change of technology. So it's the managed complex networking shift toward SDN, which means, provision raw bandwidth and use software, and there's an effectiveness and efficiency issue that comes on with that. You shift -- you may keep a customer, you continue to do business with a customer, but you don't shift that technology dollar for dollar. That's probably our most significant. The second part is our decision to exit certain product sets that are low margin and are inconsistent with our ability to sell that core transport in that secular shifting environment whereas before when we were engineering and provisioning highly complex and managed networks, we oftentimes had to bundle and bring things together which to win the business, which oftentimes led us to distribute and layer on top of that other products and services. In this more of a streamlined focused approach on transport and the accretive aspects of transport, the second dynamic that's occurring is us backing away from kind of layering on the resale of some of those services. I would tell you that the dynamic around business demand is a relatively small if non-existent dynamic in what's happening overall in our revenues. I think there's still a healthy demand in business and I would point out that while we report on fixed business segments specifically, when you look at our aggregate business performance, it's a very different story. So if you were to kind of take our wireless business component and add it to the fixed business, you have a relatively flat dynamic that's going on and that's largely because of the growth in wireless and I actually think we're on the front end right now of many businesses now understanding that wireless technology is their next strategic frontier of how they engineer their processes in their company. And I'm actually pretty bullish that what we saw in the early days of VPN were managed networks and managed capabilities and supported capabilities on complex networks were a big growth cycle in enterprise customers. I think we're going to see the same things start to emerge on the wireless side, and I think that's just going to be growth. And when we have the presence we do in these large customers, the fact that we're calling on them with one set of services and we can sell both sets of services is really important for us despite some of the secular headwinds we're taking and the technology shift out on the fixed side. John Stankey : Okay. Amir, I'm going to take the liberty of maybe closing this if I can since you said last question. And I'd like to thank first of all, all of you for joining us today. And I would tell you, the way I feel about this quarter is that the pieces have largely fallen into place for us. We have the right formula across the board in the company that's delivering the type of value that we wanted to engineer this business to deliver. And I think, in fact, if you look at the numbers and what we reported, it is delivering. And I think what you are seeing is the results of consistency, consistency of how we're executing in the business, our go-to-market approach and the focus -- the focus on a select number of products and lines of business that is making the difference of how effectively we're operating the company. And I'm really proud of what the team has done to get us to this point. It's not been an easy trail. It's been one that's had a lot of hard decisions. But it's nice to see those hard decisions paying off and the tangible results that drive returns back into the shareholder base. And I can promise you we're all focused on closing the year strong and sustaining the momentum that you've seen in the third quarter. So I thank you very much for your interest in AT&T and hope you all have a good Halloween. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does include our conference call for today. We'd like to thank you for participating in today's earnings conference call. Thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for A&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Amir. I appreciate you all joining us today and my best wishes for a productive and healthy year ahead to all of you. We finished 2023 with a strong fourth quarter as we made substantial progress on our strategy of being America's best high performance network provider. We showed again in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023 that we're delivering consistent, positive operating and financial results, including sustained margin expansion and annual free cash flow growth. To do this, we work to grow the right way, invest at historic levels in best-in-class 5G and fiber assets, and deliver the best network to more customers in more places, all while simplifying our operations to drive efficiency while enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we're now positioned to provide our growing customer base with the best communications technologies to meet their ever growing need for connectivity supporting sustainable growth. We are deliberately allocating capital to expand and enhance our networks and improve financial flexibility to drive incremental shareholder returns. Since Pascal will cover the fourth quarter results in detail later on, I'd like to highlight some of our full year accomplishments and long-term business trends. Let's start with wireless. For the full year, we delivered more than 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions with strong service revenue growth and continued historically low postpaid phone churn, all while maintaining healthy ARPUs. Taking a step back, it's clear how far our investment-led strategy has taken us from where we stood only three years ago. Since the start of 2021, we've substantially improved our mobility position and brand perception. We went from losing wireless share to growing our share of subscribers. As a result, we increased our postpaid phone base by more than 10% to more than 71.2 million subscribers. This represents our best three year stretch of postpaid phone net add growth in more than a decade. During the same three year time span, we've added to our share of industry wireless service revenue growth, increased our annual wireless service revenues by more than $7.5 billion, and grew mobility EBITDA by about $4 billion. This level of sustained success requires contributions from across the company, including our network team that continues to enhance and expand our 5G and fiber networks. Our mid-band 5G network is now available to more than 210 million people, offering faster speeds and an enhanced experience. We're also bringing more fiber to Americans than anyone else. This excites me because where we build fiber, we win. Over the past three years, we went from passing about 18 million consumer and business locations to now passing more than 26 million locations. As we continue to expand our reach, we're growing our fiber base. With 1.1 million AT&T fiber net adds in 2023, we've generated more than 1 million AT&T fiber net adds annually for six straight years. Over the past three years, we've grown AT&T fiber subscribers by 3.4 million or by nearly 70% to more than 8.3 million. This success reflects new customer wins and lower churn, trends that we see as sustainable. The financial benefits we continue to realize through our fiber focus are significant. Compared to 2020, we've more than doubled our fiber revenues to over $6.2 billion in 2023, and our broadband ARPU climbed more than 20% as customers continue to seek higher value plans with faster speeds. In addition to delivering high margin revenue growth, fiber is more energy efficient, requires less maintenance, and customers keep the service longer. Therefore, as we scale our fiber footprint, we expect to continue to drive margin expansion. This flywheel of faster subscriber growth, higher revenues, and expanding margins gives us confidence in our ability to repeat similar levels of fiber fuel growth in the future. In summary, our mobility and consumer wireline businesses are growing in a sustainable fashion. We're now a highly competitive wireless brand and the leading fiber brand. We've increased customer satisfaction, improved networks and are the best positioned to drive long-term returns as the convergence trend develops. Now let's shift to our second goal of improving efficiencies. Last July, we announced we achieved our $6 billion plus run rate cost savings target well ahead of schedule. We then set a new target for an incremental $2 billion plus in run rate cost savings by mid-2026. We're making strong early progress on this target. Importantly, we're seeing the benefits from these cost reduction efforts increasingly fall to the bottom line. This is translating into improved operating leverage, as evidenced by the adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we delivered in 2023. Going forward, we expect margin expansion to continue. I'm proud of the progress the team has made in streamlining our business. We now have further confidence in our ability to deliver on our promised goals. Turning to our last key priority. The benefits from our capital allocation strategy are meaningful and evident in our results. We were again a top investor in America's connectivity through our 5G and fiber networks in 2023. Even with our elevated levels of investment, we delivered better than expected full year free cash flow of $16.8 billion, which is above our previously raised guidance. Furthermore, we achieved this significantly higher free cash flow while simultaneously reducing our short-term obligations. We reduced our vendor financing obligations by $3.3 billion in 2023, all while making more than $2 billion of non-recurring spectrum clearing payments. With a year end net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio now below 3 times, and the improved flexibility in 2024 to dedicate more cash to debt reduction, we are confident in our path to achieve the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. So overall, I'm proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our strong fourth quarter to end the year accomplished all of our stated 2023 objectives. We replicated our success in 2022 again in 2023, exactly like we said we would. Moving to 2024, it should be no surprise that our plan is to do it again. Again, here's how we'll build off our momentum in the year ahead. In mobility, we expect to continue our success with adding quality customers on the strength of our go-to-market approach and elevated customer value proposition. We also intend to improve our performance by targeting underpenetrated segments like value oriented customers and small to medium sized businesses as well as better penetrating our expanding fiber customer base. As we do this, we'll take the same disciplined approach by remaining steadfast on profitable growth. Where we build fiber, customers love the value and service we offer, and accordingly, we become the favorite to win. We'll continue to extend our lead as the company that reaches more homes and businesses with fiber. We remain on track to pass our 30 million plus consumer and business fiber location target by the end of 2025. As I mentioned last month, the better than expected returns we are seeing on our fiber investments potentially expands the opportunity to go beyond our initial target by roughly 10 million to 15 million additional locations. This also assumes similar build parameters and a regulatory environment that remains attractive to building infrastructure. And in areas where we don't yet have fiber, AT&T Internet Air allows us to better serve customers in select markets with fixed wireless Internet access. We also expect 2024 to be the prove-it year for our Gigapower initiative, and we plan to explore other unique opportunities to extend the AT&T brand on a converged basis beyond our traditional footprint. The good news is that no one is better suited to answer the call for converged connectivity than AT&T. We already have North America's largest wireless network and the nation's largest and fastest growing fiber network. There is simply no debate that 5G and fiber are hands down the best connectivity technologies available and we are the only provider that benefits from owners' economics at scale on both technologies. Why is this so important? Traffic on our network has continued to increase in excess of 30% each year over the past three years. Our position with the most pervasive U.S. fiber footprint, the largest wireless network, puts us in the unique position to grow at an advantaged marginal cost structure. At AT&T, we're making the right moves to deliver high performance converged networking at a scale and breadth second to none in the United States. We're doing this by continuing our investment in scaled, flexible, and an increasingly open networks that address customers' needs to get on the Internet no matter where or how they are situated. Our existing strength and presence in literally every market segment from the largest multinational corporations to the most basic consumer allows us to effectively scale and commercialize the right solution with the right technology at the right price. Accordingly, we're well positioned to grow high performance networking that seamlessly combines fiber, mobile and fixed wireless, and satellite technology in the most secure and effective package desired by our customers. This is all part of orienting the company to put the customer first and prioritize simplicity in everything we do to further our growth and become more efficient in 2024. This includes enhancing our digital and self-service channels that are increasingly being supported by AI. This work will help shape the effortless and personalized customer experiences required for a truly converged future. AI-driven efficiencies are also another significant leg of our cost savings efforts as we make progress on achieving our announced incremental $2 billion plus run rate savings target by mid-2026. In summary, we have the right formula to continue the improved operating momentum established over the last three years. I'm pleased with our momentum exiting 2023 and remain optimistic about where AT&T is positioned in the broader industry as we enter a year that I suspect will shape the direction of our industry in the decade to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John shared, we've maintained our momentum across both 5G and fiber. Let's start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial summary on Slide 7. Revenues were up 2.2% for the quarter and 1.4% for the full year, largely driven by wireless service revenue, broadband revenues and Mexico. This was partly offset by a decline in business wireline. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3.2% for the quarter and 4.7% for the full year, as growth in mobility, consumer wireline, and Mexico were partly offset by a decline in business wireline. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.54, down 11.5% for the quarter due to a $0.10 impact from higher non-cash pension costs, lower capitalized interest, lower equity income from DIRECTV, and a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.41, in line with our previously stated expectations of the low 2.40s range. Free cash flow for the quarter was $6.4 billion, including about $900 million in DIRECTV distributions. For the full year, we came in above our already recently raised guidance with $16.8 billion in free cash flow. This is an improvement of $2.6 billion year-over-year, or up 19%. We achieved this free cash flow growth even with about $1 billion of higher cash taxes and about $750 million of lower cash distributions from DIRECTV. Additionally, and as previously mentioned, we reduced vendor financing obligations by $3.3 billion last year. Cash from operating activities came in at $11.4 billion for the quarter, up $1 billion year-over-year. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $4.6 billion with capital investments of $5.6 billion. Full year capital investment was $23.6 billion, as we continued to invest in 5G and fiber at historic levels. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Last year, we lowered net debt by about $3.3 billion, which was also burdened by $1.7 billion increase year-over-year for changes in FX rates related to foreign debt. We additionally completed an $8 billion pension liability transfer through the purchase of insurance annuities last spring, and we've done all this despite overcoming meaningful declines in the legacy wireline part of our business. Now let's look at our mobility segment operating results on Slide 8. Our mobility business continues to deliver strong results, growing both revenues and EBITDA for the sixth consecutive year. We are pleased with our 526,000 postpaid phone net adds for the quarter, particularly given some of the rich promotion by our peers. This success demonstrates that the general health of the wireless industry and the consistency of our go-to-market strategy, which continues to resonate with high value customers. Revenues were up more than 4% for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Service revenues also continue to improve, thanks to steady and profitable subscriber growth. In the quarter, service revenues rose about 4%, while they were up 4.4% for the full year. Mobility EBITDA for the quarter was up about $450 million or 5.6%, driven by growth in service revenues. For the full year, mobility EBITDA grew 7.4% and we continue to see margin expansion year-over-year. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $56.23, up 1.4% year-over-year. ARPU growth continues to be largely driven by our targeted pricing actions and from customers trading up to higher priced unlimited plans. Postpaid phone churn of 0.84% for the quarter remained historically low. Our continued low churn levels clearly demonstrate customers prefer the value proposition they are getting from AT&T. In prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% with Cricket phone churn substantially lower. We remain encouraged by the overall health of the wireless industry and are confident that our mobility business will deliver again as we expect to continue to grow in customers, service revenues, and EBITDA to healthy clip in 2024. Now let's move to consumer and business wireline results, which are on Slide 9. Let's start with consumer wireline. As John mentioned, the financial and operational performance of our fiber business is exceeding our initial expectation. Wherever we have fiber, we continue to win. In the fourth quarter, we added 273,000 fiber customers even in a seasonally slow fourth quarter and lower year-over-year household moves. This accentuates the resiliency of fiber and the superior experience it provides customers. Broadband revenues grew more than 8% year-over-year due to fiber revenue growth. Fiber ARPU was $68.50, up $0.29 sequentially, with intake ARPU now at more than $70. Consumer wireline EBITDA grew more than 10% for the quarter and more than 8% for the full year due to growth in fiber revenues and the more efficient cost profile of fiber. And while fiber remains our focus and lead product, we've also been encouraged by the initial introduction of AT&T Internet Air, our targeted fixed wireless access service. We had 93,000 AT&T Internet Air subscribers at the end of the year and now offer this service in parts of 35 locations. Turning to business wireline. EBITDA was down about 19% in the quarter. This was impacted by about $100 million of items, primarily discrete intellectual property transaction revenues we had in the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. As I will discuss in a moment, we expect trends in business wireline EBITDA to improve on a full year basis in 2024. In the fourth quarter, our business solutions wireless service revenues grew nearly 6%. This is an area where we continue to grow faster than our nearest peer. FirstNet also continues to be a growth factor for us with wireless connections growing by about 260,000 sequentially. Now let's move to Slide 10 for our 2024 financial guidance. Here are our expectations for the year. First, we expect to again grow mobility subscribers against a healthy, but normalized industry growth. We also anticipate continued benefits from a larger subscriber base and modest growth in postpaid phone ARPUs. This should result in wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range for the full year. For broadband, we expect revenue increases of 7% plus for the full year. This growth reflects continued fiber subscriber growth and higher ARPUs from the mix shift to fiber. Overall, we expect to continue to grow consolidated revenues next year. As we think about the EBITDA trends in 2024, we expect to grow mobility EBITDA in the mid-single digit as our disciplined approach helps us to grow valuable subscribers. In business wireline, we expect EBITDA to be down about 10% plus or minus. We expect legacy business wireline declines to be partially offset by incremental cost savings and increased fiber and fixed wireless revenues. Additionally, our guidance reflects the impact of the expected deconsolidation of our cybersecurity services business. In consumer wireline, we expect to grow EBITDA in the mid-single digit range, thanks to continued growth in fiber revenues, and to a lesser degree, growth in fixed wireless subscribers. This will be partly offset by an expected continued decline in legacy copper revenues. Finally, similar to last year, we expect to benefit from ongoing corporate cost reductions again this year. These factors combined deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range for the full year. Moving to EPS. Here's what to think about when you do your calculations. Our full year guidance reflects non-cash headwinds of about $0.24, which include the following; $0.17 higher depreciation; approximately half is from accelerated depreciation on Nokia assets impacted by our Open RAN transformation, and we expect this impact to continue through 2026. The other half is incremental depreciation from our elevated 5G and fiber builds; headwinds of approximately $0.07 associated with higher non-cash pension and postretirement benefit costs, largely driven by declines in prior service credit amortization. As a reminder, prior service credit are the result of amendments made in prior years to our postretirement benefit plan that reduced benefits. Under GAAP, the impact of these amendments is recorded as a credit and equity and amortized into income over the expected service period of plan participants. In 2023, prior service credit amortization was $2.6 billion, which is a positive contribution to other income. In 2024, we expect prior service credit amortization to be $2 billion or a decline of about $600 million. Next year, we expect a more moderate decline in prior service credit amortization, continuing to decrease in the subsequent years as prior year plan changes become fully amortized. We have provided the projected future annual amortization by year in the footnotes of our supplemental financial trends document on our Investor Relations website. Importantly, we have continued to lower our pension obligation, including our transfer of certain pension assets and liabilities to Athene last year and we don't expect any material required contributions to our pension plans for the balance of this decade. In addition to these non-cash items, the guidance also includes $0.08 of other headwinds. These include $0.05 impact from lower spectrum related interest capitalization as we near completion of our initial C-band spectrum deployment in 2024. We don't expect capitalized interest to be a significant headwind beyond 2024, and $0.03 impact from lower adjusted equity income from DIRECTV, which we expect to be about $2.6 billion versus $2.9 billion in 2023. Lastly, we expect an effective tax rate in 2024 consistent with the 2023 rate. Given these assumptions, adjusted EPS for 2024 is expected to be in the $2.15 to $2.25 range. Normalizing for these four items, our 2024 guides would imply adjusted EPS growth consistent with our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA. We expect to be in a position to begin to grow adjusted EPS again in 2025. Turning to free cash flow. Here's what to consider for 2024. First, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range. We also expect cash taxes to be up about $1.5 billion based on current tax law. As we look out to 2025, we would anticipate cash taxes to increase around $1 billion over 2024. Cash distributions from DIRECTV in 2023 were $3.7 billion, down about $750 million compared to the prior year. Looking forward, we expect DIRECTV cash distributions to decline at a similar rate in 2024 and thereafter. I'd also like to point out that DIRECTV's debt levels have not changed materially since the end of 2021 and its debt is non-recourse to AT&T. Another impact to free cash flow is lower capital investment. We expect 2024 capital investment levels in the $21 billion to $22 billion range. It's also important to note that the mix shift of our capital investment continues to move in a favorable direction as vendor financing obligations decline and project capital spend increases. Accordingly, we plan to continue to pay down short-term vendor and direct supplier financings this year as we shape an even more sustainable and ratable quarterly free cash flow cadence. Remember, our capital investments consist of payments from prior year capital spend plus current year spend. This year, there will be less payments of prior year obligations than we saw in 2023 due to significant reductions in vendor financing. However, in the year, we do expect higher spend on capital projects. When you combine all these factors, we expect to deliver free cash flow in the $17 billion to $18 billion range this year. This is greater than 2 times our current annual common dividend and more than enough to cover other commitments. As we discussed in recent quarters, we continue to make progress on improving the ratability of our free cash flow. Last year, our free cash flow was about 70% back-end loaded to the second half. We expect that to be closer to 60% this year. Accordingly, we expect first quarter free cash flows of at least $2.5 billion. Overall, the combination of increased free cash flow and fewer one-time items will enable us to continue our deleveraging progress in 2024 and remain on track to achieve our target range of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First, thanks for other detail on the free cash flow. Pascal. But can we focused on the sustainability of the postpaid phone growth in '24 . You added 1.7 million subs that gross adds were down a bit in the fourth quarter. I guess, first, could you talk about the momentum you're seeing here, here in the first quarter and how competition shaping up? And then John, you talked about these under-penetrated markets these three segments value, SME and conversion. Any color you can give us in terms of how big of an opportunity, those underpenetrated segments are in our, how you expect to adjust that year and '24? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi. Good morning, John. Happy New Year. So look, the -- first of all, on the aggregate market, as we've been indicating, we thought there was going to be a little bit of a slowdown from previous year's activity level. We saw that happen in '23. I think we're at a more normalized level right now. We're kind of expecting that is going to continue into next year. It'll be probably right around the same place. We're not going to see it dramatically different. And our expectations are we're going to continue to attack the market the same way we've been attacking it, and we've been really consistent about that over the last three years. And I don't think you should expect to see that there is going to be any less sustainability of our performance than what you've seen over the previous couple of years in the strategies and the tactics we use. I think the market is a healthy market right now. I would say, if you would look at the fourth quarter and look at what we delivered on postpaid phone net adds, your point on gross is an accurate statement, and I think it reflects the fact that we're trying to be incredibly disciplined around profitable growth. We managed to outgrow one of our peers that has already reported. We did that, I think, being very disciplined on our promotional levels and being very strategic in the channels that we operate in. As I've indicated on previous calls, we delivered an incredible churn level, which helped us do that. It's always easier to keep your customers than to churn them out. We've managed to keep that churn level while we've been growing ARPU. We're driving operating leverage and EBITDA growth in a really strong fashion. I think the equation is incredibly sustainable with what we're doing right now. We're going to tweak it, and that's what I was alluding to and some of the things that we know there's some areas where we could probably do a little bit better. I suspect, looking at some of the numbers yesterday from what Verizon reported, there's some areas that they probably looked at and said that they can do a little bit better in, and we all have regional players that we play against and things that we do, like the cable companies, that, as we kind of understand the playbook and look at it, we can adjust how we approach that. They're kind of a new player in the market. My guess is, after everybody comes out and reports, we're going to see that the three large incumbent wireless carriers have had very effective quarters. We all understand how to run our business. I think we're all being pretty disciplined around how we go about it. I think we're all conscious of the fact that we've invested at record levels and need to make sure that we're driving returns on those record levels of investments. And to me, that kind of lines up for a very sustainable outlook as we move into next year. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks, John. Operator : And Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Wanted to come back to the balance sheet. We're now looking at sort of this time next year or near the -- where you hit your 2.5 times first half of '25, so it's getting closer. How are you weighing at this point the opportunities to either buy back stock or to attack that 10 million to 15 million additional fiber homes or delever further? It would be great to get your thoughts on that. And then if you can give us anything on your ACP exposure and how that might play out and your latest thoughts on BEAD, that would be great. John Stankey : Sure. Morning, Simon. Simon Flannery : Good morning. John Stankey : So I would say first of all, and we've been really clear on this and it doesn't change, first and foremost, we want to invest at the right level in our business to make sure that we can grow it in a way that we think drives sustainable returns to our shareholders. Secondly, the dividend is something that we have to protect and make sure that we're offering a fair return on, and then getting the balance sheet where we want to get the balance sheet is absolutely critical. When we arrive at that point, it's the time to make the decision, and the decision has to be made relative to where stock is trading, where interest rates are in the environment, what opportunities we have in front of us as a business to continue to grow things based on how policies evolve in this country, and where we think there is opportunity for us to grow and get fair returns. All those things will go into the Board's deliberation. I think what you're touching on though is we are about ready to enter the doorstep where we have choices around what we do with that capital, and that's the most important thing. And I step back from the year of 2023 and look at the progress that we have made, not just on delivering the commitments that we made back to all of you and our investors, but the fundamental improvements in the structure of our balance sheet, the momentum that we have in the business and to be on the doorstep of those options is a really exciting thing in aggregate for the management team. And I think it shows an incredible amount of progress on the hard work. We have a tremendous amount of optionality in front of us. As we shared with you, our balance sheet is in really good shape in terms of how we've been able to tear (ph) us out our obligations and the rates that we're paying on it, and how our organic cash flow will allow us to pay down the maturing debt that's in there. And so as we choose to drive more shareholder value, the field is wide open to us as to where we wish to go and what we wish to do, and we will do what is in the most and best interest of the shareholder at that point in time. And we view it as being a really important moment for us to arrive at. It's something the management team is focused on and is ensuring that we get there and we all know that it's incredibly important to driving the value in our stock. On the ACP side, I guess the editorial comment I'll make is, it's unfortunate that we're at this moment, and I say that from the perspective of we have an awful lot of subsidy that's deliberate and overt, that are in regulatory structures today, which are important to ensure that every American can gain access to the Internet. And those subsidies, unfortunately in many cases, were set up and structured from many years ago, and they've been funded under constructs that have kind of run their time as industry and products have shifted and changed. And from my point of view, regulators right now should be spending their time and energy stepping back from that and understanding how we take all the different subsidy structures in place and get them together in a coherent approach to ensuring those most in need can get subsidy that they need to be able to afford access to the Internet so that as a country, we can step back and say that everybody has access to capable, scalable Internet that allows them to do all the things that are so critical today. And I think through a combination of ACP, universal service reform, other programs that are out there, that money is there, if there was a political will and a coherent policy put forward, that it would be good for the industry and good for our country. Unfortunately, we now are looking at a triage moment on one program, ACP. I don't know where it's going to go. I will tell you, either way it goes, we'll be fine. We've given you guidance fully knowing it can break one way or the other. I'm comfortable that what we can deliver in our plan next year isn't going to hang on what the government chooses to do with ACP. If they choose to cancel the program and don't fund it and move forward on it, we have plays that we'll run. We have things that we'll do with our customers and how we approach the market and what we do to respond to it. And we believe we can manage through that in an effective way within the context of the size of our company and what we do and how we go to market. If they go the other way and they do manage to fund it or fund it on some kind of a revised basis, AT&T will be continuing to lobby that regulators should be thinking about a more holistic and sustainable approach, trying to get this right for the future so we don't approach this moment again. It's some last minute circumstance and that we can have a thoughtful approach to it. And that battle will not go away, and I think it's the important thing for all of us to do. On the BEAD side, Simon, I don't know that a lot has changed other than we've seen some incremental progress on a couple of states moving forward in their process. As I shared with you the last time I was asked this question, we'll probably have 50 different recipes of how BEAD ultimately works its way into the market. There may be some similarity between each of the states, but there clearly is 50 different states and 50 different points of view on this. I think we're going to be very measured and targeted as to where we go in both in terms of the states that are setting up the right kind of rules that incent the joint private sector investment as well as the right rules that are sustainable for how you operate in that. I think a good news story is, I point to a state like Texas, I think was the largest benefactor of BEAD financing, seems to me policy wise they have a pretty sound approach to things. It looks to me like we can work effectively in the state. Given it's a large amount, we'll probably have good opportunity there. There's a few other states that I look at and say I'm not sure the policies are going to line up effectively. The end of the day, as I said in my opening comments, we have 10 million to 15 million organic opportunities to go and invest and build. We know what the average cost per past location is for us to build those areas. It's a very controlled and measurable number. In some of the BEAD circumstances, the amount of private capital per living unit that's being required is actually substantially higher than what our average cost is and what I would call our organic and market-driven non-BEAD footprint. And so if I think about I can get more scale, more households faster in places where the construct is very straightforward, the amounts and the plays to run are getting more scale in existing areas, that's what weighs against your incentive to invest. And I think states that understand that are coming up with smart policies to try to be competitive with that and states that don't understand that are probably going to have pretty voluminous and deep requirements that ultimately cause private capital to maybe shy away from matching in some of those areas. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thank you. John, maybe talk about pricing in wireless this year. Verizon just ran through another one. It seems like the inflation driven wave of general consumer price increases is slowing. Do you think there's more room to take a little more price in the postpaid space? And then maybe just expand on the AT&T Air effort. How much does this scale over time and how many more markets do you think are possible this year? Thank you. John Stankey : Good morning, Phil. So look, I'll give you the same answer on pricing I think I probably give every time I'm asked it, and I just suggest there is a string of data points to go back and look at to kind of buttress up my observations on this, which is, we've been pretty deliberate about where we think we add additional value into our customers and whether or not we can ultimately drive price changes that are aligned with driving that incremental value. And as I mentioned earlier, we've invested a heck of a lot in our networks. People are using over 30% more of it per year. They are getting more utility out of what we do, and the capability of the networks is allowing them to do more things in more ways. And as a result of that, I think that value is allowing us to go in, in places and certainly drive some renumeration for the level of investments that we're putting in. And you see it in our ARPU growth. I think we\u2019ve shared with you that we expect probably some modest ARPU accretion in our guidance as we move through next year in the wireless space. Some of that will come from moving people up to higher priced plans with more bells and whistles, and some of it will come through pricing movement. I would tell you, I go and I rest on our track record. You're seeing the numbers, you're seeing what we've been able to do. I think we can continue to run many of the same plays that we've run, and we're doing it with, I don't know, we may end up with another record churn quarter or best in industry churn quarter. We'll be darn close to it, and we're doing it at levels of ARPU performance in the market that I think is pretty stellar. So my message is, I think we know how to do this. I think we've done it pretty effectively. I think the team is pretty diligent about it. I think there's opportunities for us to continue running the business the way we've been running the business. And I expect we'll have to do that in 2024 to deliver our plan and do what we need to do, inflation driven or not. On AT&T Air, again, not much different in my narrative around it. I don't expect that we are going to be pushing the product in the same way that some others in the market are pushing it today. We've made a conscious choice as a company that we want to dedicate capital to investing in fiber, which we believe is a more sustainable, long-term means to deal with stationary and fixed broadband needs. It doesn't mean that we don't think that fixed wireless serves some segment of the market. It does. It serves certain types of circumstances in the consumer base. It serves certain types of circumstances in the business base. And we will take advantage of those certain circumstances. As I've said, there's a lot of small businesses that have usage profiles that fixed wireless is very attractive to. It's something that we will lean into this year. You will see it reflected in our performance as we move throughout the year. We have places where because of our spectrum profile and our share position in particular markets, we can maybe lean in a little bit more aggressively in defining the consumer segment that we might serve with the product and service on a competitive market that you will see us begin to add some degree of market penetration on. And as I've told you before, we will continue to use it very, very actively in our transition away from legacy assets as we begin to shutter copper footprint, take out square miles in our network, not have the operating costs associated with those fixed infrastructure that we can use this as a catch product. It's a very effective catch product in some of those areas, especially given the density characteristics of what's happened that we haven't built fiber there yet or we will not build fiber, but it still allows us to meet our obligation back to the customer base and our state franchise agreements etc. So I don't think you're ever going to see a scale to the kind of monthly numbers and quarterly numbers you see coming from some of our competitors, but it's a great tool. It's a great opportunity for us to continue to grow. I think the most important thing to understand, as you've seen is, we are broadband positive, aggregate broadband positive, and we are going to continue to be aggregate broadband positive going forward. So not only are we growing EBITDA, we're going to now start growing the customer base and this will be one of the tools we use to have that ratable, sustainable growth that I think we've been seeking. Phil Cusick : Thanks, John. Operator : We have a question from the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess the first one, Pascal, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit on the range of the free cash flow guidance. Is it dependent largely on where capital investment lands within that 21 to 22 or are there other potential moving parts that we don't see in that equation? And I guess related to that, maybe John, the end of the year, you had 26 million fiber homes passed. The goal is 30 million by 2025. Obviously you've got a choice to kind of continue to kind of deploy the way you've been doing, which puts you closer to that 30 million by the end of this year, or you could throttle it back in an effort to contain the capital investment out the door and support the free cash flow guide. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on the game plan there? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Dave. Good morning, and Happy New Year. Here's the way I think about cash. We've made really good progress over the course of 2023 in paying down some of our short-term financing obligations. And therefore, as I look at the capital spend in 2024, it's going to be more heavily weighted towards project spend. We have really good line of sight on that. It's going to be within the range we provided to you, and we feel really good about that. The other factor that we have reasonably good line of sight to is our cash taxes for the year. Based on current legislation, we have pretty good line of sight in terms of where that lands. Obviously, we're expecting EBITDA to grow. That's going to be the driver of the growth, coupled with the step down in capital investment. I don't anticipate any material headwinds from working capital, albeit depending upon how we're doing, we may decide to continue to lean into short-term financing obligations to reduce those. So those are the swing factors, but look, all in all, feel really good about our ability to deliver on the guidance and continue to grow the business from there. John Stankey : Dave, the way I would tell you, I go back to the question that was asked earlier about capital allocation, what we need to do. And I would say first and foremost, you've got to understand, we've given you guidance. We've made a set of commitments. Those are important to us. That's what we need to deliver. And whatever decision making we ultimately undertake has got to be within that context of ensuring that we're consistent in delivering back to you and our commitments. What I would tell you, it's not just making a decision of, well, are there incremental homes you can go get with fiber. There are opportunities to present ourselves -- present themselves to our business in a variety of different places where we have a choice to say, well, we're a little ahead of plan or we were a little more efficient, should we do something else here or there and we'll take advantage of those things every time they pop up. And I would tell you, very comfortable we're going to meet our commitment to you of 30 million passings, but I don't know, we could see something happen where we get a vendor's circumstance like we've seen in wireless, where somebody comes in and changes pricing and we get more efficiency out of something, or we see great results coming back in on the Gigapower side, and we decide that's a better place to go and allocate a little bit more capital. All those things are evolving. We'll weigh them, we'll make decisions, and we'll come back in and we'll tell you what we're going to do, all within the context of we want to make sure we're consistent in meeting our commitments back to you. David Barden : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : And Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good morning. I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of the state of the economy for consumers and businesses? And for your business wireline segment, can you share more of the playbook of how AT&T is planning to improve operating performance in that segment? John Stankey : Good morning, Michael. Happy to. So look, the economy has proven resilient. I expect the economy is probably going to continue to be reasonably resilient moving into this year. It's an election year. Not that I'm a great soothsayer of what it's going to drive in terms of policy, but it seems like there's wins lining up that, like you would expect, moving into an important election year, policy will probably be such that it favors, trying to keep growth in the right place. And I think that will probably take what was a bit of a tenuous situation last year in terms of the rate of inflation decline and what that might do to growth rates and move us through a 2024 that's probably going to continue to be one where we perk along and see the economy growing. Our expectations are that we're going to see some kind of uptick in growth. We think the combination of a little bit higher than probably target level inflations and -- inflation and what's going on in aggregate in the economy, it's going to keep it a little bit tampered down, but it's something that we expect to still see to be relatively productive. We haven't seen anything with the consumer that suggests they're not paying their bills or not in a position to continue to buy services from us. We certainly don't see anything in business formation right now that causes us any degree of concern at this juncture. So by and large, I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place moving into 2024, absent what I would call big exogenous variables in the global system that occurs. We feel like policy will probably line up pretty well. On the business wireline side, I think there's a couple things I'd first say is, one, what was not the right stuff in the fourth quarter that we have to kind of acknowledge, one -- Pascal mentioned in his comments, we had nearly $100 million of one-time stuff that didn't repeat. That's certainly fully explainable, something we expected would be the case. The piece that probably I don't think we nailed at the beginning of the planning cycle for '23 that ended up transpiring over the course of '24 that further impacted that segment was wholesale revenues were weaker than what we expected. Those are important revenues in the segment because they tend to be higher margin, more resilient subscription-based services. There's been a fair amount going on in the industry relative to restructuring of access services and wholesale. Some of it's been driven through M&A consolidation, some of it's through technology. We are through, we believe, the worst of that now. We've had two years of having to kind of deal with a lot of that repositioning and renegotiation of contracts. We think we're in a pretty good position where our visibility for '24 is better than where we have been, and don't expect that we're going to have quite the pressure we saw from that side of things that is a bit different from a forecasting and fundamentals perspective. And then I go to how we have to execute differently. I've given a fair amount of information and focus on we're really shifting into the mid-market and trying to be a much more effective provider into the mid-market, and we are in fact seeing the green shoots of that occurring. It's moving a little slower than I might like. It requires us to open up entirely new distribution channels. It requires us to cultivate new relationships with ways to represent our products than what we've traditionally done, through what I would call direct owned and operated channels, requires us to rebundle and repackage the products a bit differently to be effective in that space of which we've been doing. And that requires us to do things like reprice, change systems, build capabilities for third parties to work with. We are making progress and we're seeing that. We're starting to see that instantiate itself in fiber-driven revenues that are coming on the products and services we want to sell, which are connectivity-based products and services. And so we're going to continue to run those plays. We've got to get a little bit better at it. But I'd also say step back and realize that while we report segment wise for wireline only, you should understand that the business marketplace is an important marketplace to us. And on a combined basis, wireless and wireline, we're still growing EBITDA in that segment. And some of it is being driven from the goodness of more and more businesses are able to run the core of their company on a wireless infrastructure. And you're seeing some of that put the pressure on the wireline side of the business, but we're benefiting from that on the pickup on the other side. And when we talk about things like fixed wireless asset and AT&T Internet Air being an opportunity for us, we will be in a much better position this year on the catch to do some of that. And frankly, that's not a trajectory move and a structural move that I think is a bad one for us over the long run. So that's kind of how I view the segment moving in. And we still think our brand plays incredibly well. We can walk in and have credibility. We've got the right products that ultimately customers want if we can get them distributed properly. And I have high optimism that as convergence becomes more important, we will distinguish ourselves further in the mid-market. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Mike. One other point, just to add as well, as the legacy revenues continue to decline, we have an opportunity to continue to really hit costs in that sector fairly hard. And so I'm confident that that will also be a factor in moderating the losses over time. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Mike. Operator, we've got time for one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Horan, your line is open. Tim Horan : Sorry about that. Can you talk about the longer term capital intensity, what you're kind of thinking currently? And I guess there's a lot of moving parts with free cash flow. Maybe a sense, can you grow free cash flow off of this year? It seems like you can and it seems like your capital intensity is still relatively high versus your peers. Just some color around longer term free cash flow growth. Thanks. John Stankey : Yeah. Let me -- going back on the capital allocation issues, Tim, I obviously believe that we should not be at the sustained levels of investment that we're at right now for ever. Our point of view is, we're building infrastructure that's sustainable infrastructure that will build a franchise that will last for many years to come. The fiber investment is a hard one to do at the front end, but it's an incredibly durable investment. The depreciation levels on this go out a long time for a reason. And the beauty of the technology is, improving capacity on it is a relatively light lift incrementally once you got the glass in the ground. So you've heard me talk about we should be at mid-teens as a percent of revenue in a steady state as we kind of get through the front end of this investment cycle. As long as we continue to perform in the market the way we've been performing on this elevated level of investment, I am comfortable that we should continue to do that, but we've got to continue to perform and make sure we deliver the right kind of results on that. So we've probably come through the worst of it at this juncture. We will get through kind of what we need to do on fiber before we're into another air interface investment. And as I mentioned in some of my public remarks that I made in December, the fact that we're moving to ORAN will give us another way to kind of manage some of our capital intensity moving forward. The way I wish to describe that is it's not going to get us to different levels of historic investment, but it will be one of the tools that we do to manage our portfolio of capital investment between fixed and mobile services to drive the kind of returns we need to drive. We're going to get more tools out of our ORAN investment to do that and still meet the needs of our capacity growth in a more efficient fashion in our wireless network moving forward that gives us the room to do some of the things that we want to do on the fixed side. So I feel pretty good about where we are. I think we're through the worst of it. We'll see it continue to get more efficient as we move forward. We'll be selective of where we can get those kind of returns based on our market performance, and overall, I think we're in good shape. Pascal, do you want to add anything on that? Pascal Desroches : No. Look, the investments we've been making obviously are working, and as I look forward, we've said it, we expect to operate at mid-teens capital intensity long term, and we're committed to that. We're also committed to having a capital allocation plan that also looks for other ways to deliver value to shareholders. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, Tim. Turn over to John for final comments. A - John Stankey : Well, thanks. Appreciate everybody sticking with us, and I apologize about some of the longer prepared remarks at the front end, but that's not atypical as we try to give you some guidance and visibility into the business, and appreciate you enduring that. I would just reiterate what I said in my opening remarks that I thought 2023 was an incredibly solid year for us from an execution perspective at AT&T. I'm incredibly proud across the board of what we've done and the formula in optimizing the various parts of the business as we move through it. It's as solid, a fundamental year at AT&T as I can remember in recent history, certainly in a very long time. If I think about those fundamentals, you see them manifested all the way through the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. And I think that's the most important thing to kind of step back from and realize this business enters 2024 in a very, very strong and healthy position. I'm excited about where we enter 2024. We've taken great steps to simplify our business. We still have some more work to do in that regard, but we are entirely focused on the future right now, and it's a future that I believe lines up incredibly well for the asset base of AT&T as consumer tastes are changing, as we're seeing the move to convergence, as we see the growth that's occurring and the importance of high performance networking that I believe AT&T has the asset base and the positioning to move with where this future is going. And that's why I'm so optimistic about what we have in front of us. And I think we're going to get to a very exciting place to start a 2025 where we have the choices in front of us that we would like to have and we've worked so hard to get. I'll give you one final housekeeping thing before we separate. This is Amir's last call with us. We've worked him hard the last three years, and I guess like any thoroughbred that we work hard, we need to send him on to his next chapter, and we're excited about what he's going to be able to do for us as we give him a new opportunity to show what he's been able to do and learn about the business. And as a result of that, I hope you join me in welcoming Brett Feldman to AT&T. A couple of you might know Brett. He's been around a little bit. We're delighted to add Brett, and as good a job as Amir has done, and it's really hard to fill those Air Jordans, I'm sure Brett will do an exceptional job of that. We think it'll be a great addition to the management team and we'll continue to work hard to keep you in the loop moving forward. So thank you all very much for your time this morning, and we'll see you in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's AT&T's earning call. We'd like to thank you for your participation and thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Brett Feldman, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I'm Brett Feldman, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO, and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings, results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Brett. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. We started the year with a solid first quarter, as we continue to make steady progress on our investment-led strategy, being the best connectivity provider through 5G and fiber. We're growing the right way by adding valuable long-term wireless and broadband subscribers. Since Pascal will cover first quarter results in detail, I'd like to spend some time highlighting how our strategic priorities are enabling us to deliver positive results and build a long runway for sustainable growth. When you look under the hood, it's clear that our largest and most powerful EBITDA growth engine mobility is running well. Our strength and value proposition help us deliver 349,000 postpaid phone net adds in the first quarter. We now have about 71.6 million high value postpaid phone subscribers, which is up 1.5 million from a year ago, and these aren't empty calorie additions. Our results reflect the quality of our customer growth with higher ARPU, higher adjusted operating income, improved margins and lower postpaid churn. We're also growing efficiently, thanks to our consistent and simple go-to market strategy. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.72% was our lowest first quarter churn ever on record. And once again, we expect to report the lowest postpaid phone churn among the major service providers this quarter. This highlights the value customers place on the wireless service we provide and the continued strength of our best deals for everyone's strategy. Now let's move to fiber, which is our fastest growing engine. The story here is familiar and one we like. Where we have fiber, we win, and we're bringing fiber to more Americans than anyone else. Since the first quarter of last year, we passed about 2.4 million locations with fiber and now passed more than 27 million consumer and business locations. Over the last year, we grew our AT&T fiber consumer subscriber base by about 1.1 million to nearly 8.6 million customers. This includes 252,000 AT&T fiber net additions in the first quarter. As a result of our established fiber success in early AT&T Internet Air subscriber growth, we've grown our consumer broadband subscriber base for three consecutive quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. We're even more excited about the converging power of 5G and fiber together, where we have AT&T Fiber, our strong national 5G wireless brand provides us the opportunity to be customers single converged provider seamlessly connecting them both in the home and on the go. We're able to deliver convergence at a level that none of our peers can match, as we're the only provider that benefits from owners' economics and scale with both 5G and fiber. This all matters because convergence presents clear benefits. When a customer has both our wireless and fiber products, we see a meaningful improvement in churn and net promoter scores. This ultimately translates to much higher lifetime values for converged customers. We are also making great progress on ensuring more Americans have access to high-speed Internet. Just this month, we expanded our commitment to $5 billion over this decade to help bridge the digital divide in our country. We've already contributed to connecting approximately 5 million Americans, and our goal is to help connect 25 million people in total by 2030. We believe that connecting changes everything and that we must collectively address the communications capabilities of our country's needs for the next century not the last one. To make this happen, we need sound policy, that's done, right, and our teams are working hard to make that happen. The future of connectivity is critical to advancing our society. That's why we're focused on growing and evolving our networks. As a result of these efforts the areas, where we're investing most heavily through 5G and fiber are performing very well. For a perspective, in 2023, mobility and consumer wireline together represented more than 80% of revenue and about 85% of EBITDA in our communications segment. This means, we're growing the large majority of our business and driving improved operating leverage across it. We expect this to continue. However, we still have legacy elements of our business that we're in the midst of transitioning, particularly in business wireline. In the quarter, business wireline EBITDA was down 16.5%, as the industrywide secular decline of legacy voice continues. While the wholesale market is stabilized, the reality is that businesses are transitioning to mobile and cloud-based services at an accelerated rate, as post pandemic workplace restructuring takes hold. We see the benefits from this connectivity transition in business solutions, where wireless service revenues grew 4.6% in the first quarter, outpacing our overall mobility services revenue growth. While we continue to actively work our legacy transition strategies to end of life products, reduce our operating footprint and eliminate fixed costs, we're advancing several cost savings and productivity initiatives to align with this reality, such as vendor and management workforce rationalization. We also strongly believe that the future focused area of business solutions aligns well with our core connectivity competencies and we continue to build out a connectivity portfolio with real long-term growth opportunity. Take FirstNet. This prioritized service for first responders shows what we're able to accomplish when we focus on growing our business in areas, where we have traditionally under indexed. Additionally, our continued 5G and fiber expansion will enable new growth when paired with broader distribution. We have relationships with nearly 2.5 million business customers today and an opportunity to win with more small to medium sized businesses. One way we intend to meet small and medium businesses connectivity needs is with our new fixed wireless service, AT&T Internet Air for business. We believe this is a durable national play with business because it's able to serve as a reliable 5G powered primary Internet Connection, where fiber is not available in remote locations when temporary access is needed or with small and medium businesses that don't require always on video streaming. While it's still early, we've been very pleased with the solid demand we're seeing from businesses. Given our success, growing core connectivity, we're focused on furthering the AT&T value proposition in ways that matter to our business customers and security is at the top of their list. That's why we introduced AT&T Dynamic Defense, which provides built-in security controls on top of worldclass access. The takeaway is that we're well positioned to capitalize on emerging connectivity opportunities with businesses thanks to the strong relationships we have with almost all the Fortune 1000 and our leading position in fiber and the fact we operate the largest wireless network in the US. Our business wireline operations transformation will not be a linear process and we're going through the heaviest lift right now. However, our strong momentum across our growth areas of mobility and broadband is allowing us to outpace legacy declines and drive positive consolidated results and we remain on track to deliver on all the consolidated financial guidance we shared in January. Now let's spend a moment on our second priority of being effective and efficient in everything we do. Last year, we set a new target for an incremental $2 billion plus in run rate cost savings by mid-2026. This came on top of the $6 billion plus run rate cost savings target we achieved last year. The continued adoption of AI is not only helping us make progress on this goal, but also benefiting our employee and customer experiences. This focus on efficiency is translating into improved operating leverage despite continued elevated inflation. You can see this in our cash operating expenses, which were down year-over-year in the first quarter contributing to adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 170 basis points. This brings me to our final priority, which is our deliberate and balanced approach to capital allocation. As we indicated would happen, our capital investment levels have come down year-over-year, as we move past the peak of our 5G rollout. Still, we remain a top investor in America's connectivity and continued to expand fiber at a steady pace. Even with this continued investment, we delivered first quarter free cash flow of $3.1 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago. This aligns with the expectations we shared for more ratable quarterly free cash flow, which we've accomplished by efficiently growing EBITDA, improving cash conversion and reducing our short-term financing balances. Our strong free cash flow has also enabled us to pay down debt. We finished the first quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9 times and continue to expect to reach our target in the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. So it's clear we're operating well against our business priorities, and as a result, we're growing share with 5G and fiber. In mobility, we've been increasing our share of wireless service revenue growth even without the benefit of fixed wireless, which is reported in consumer wireline. We also expect that this will be the 11th time in the last 13 quarters, where we deliver the industry's lowest postpaid phone churn. In consumer wireline, we're outpacing cable, as we add broadband customers. This is driven by AT&T fiber, which is consistently captured over one-third of broadband net adds across major providers for the past three years. So, in summary, across the services and technologies most important to the future, 5G and fiber were performing well and growing our share in a healthy industry environment. This gives me confidence in our strategy and tells me our team is making solid progress on our priorities. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and let's start by reviewing our first quarter financial summary on Slide 7. In the first quarter, revenues were down slightly as a decline in low margin mobility equipment revenues and business wireline revenues offset growth in high margin wireless service revenues and fiber revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was up 4.3% for the quarter, as growth in mobility, consumer wireline in Mexico were partially offset by continued decline in business wireline. For the full year, we still expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range. Adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.60 in the year ago quarter. In the quarter, there were about $0.11 of aggregated EPS headwinds from four items we discussed last quarter. These include higher depreciation, higher non-cash postretirement benefit costs, lower capitalized interest, and lower equity income from DIRECTV. For the full year, our expectations remain for adjusted EPS of $2.15 to $2.25. First quarter free cash flow of $3.1 billion was up more than $2 billion compared to last year. The important takeaway is that improved conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow has allowed us to pay down short-term supplier obligations. The paydown of this facility should allow us to continue to drive more ratable quarterly free cash flow. Cash from operating activities came in at $7.5 billion versus $6.7 billion last year. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically the high watermark for device payments and we expect payments to get progressively lower throughout the year. Capital investment for the quarter was $4.6 billion, down about $1.8 billion compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in the prior year. Now let's look at our mobility operating results on Slide 8. The wireless industry remains healthy and our mobility business continues to deliver strong results, driven by our consistent go-to market strategy and solid execution. For the quarter, we reported 349,000 postpaid phone net adds. We grew service revenue by 3.3%, which included the impact of customer credits. This was offset by lower equipment revenues with postpaid upgrade rate of 3%, which was down from 3.7% last year. We continue to expect wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range for the full year. Mobility EBITDA grew 7% or about $600 million year-over-year, which exceeded service revenue growth on a dollar basis. This demonstrates we're significantly improving operating leverage and highlights the efficiency of our consistent go-to market strategy, which has enabled us to take costs out of the business. We now expect our mobility EBITDA to grow in the higher end of the mid-single-digit range this year, driven by better-than-expected performance with business wireless customers and continued disciplined cost management. Our postpaid phone ARPU was $55.57. This was up nearly 1% year-over-year, largely driven by higher ARPU and legacy plans. For the year, we continue to expect modest postpaid phone ARPU growth. Now let's move to consumer wireline results on Slide 9. Our growth in consumer wireline was led once again by our fiber subscriber growth, which has consistently yielded strong returns. In the quarter, we had 252,000 AT&T fiber net adds, which is in line with the outlook we provided. This is the 17th consecutive quarter with AT&T fiber net adds above 200,000. We now have fiber penetration of 40% with several markets well above that level. Broadband revenues grew 7.7% including strong fiber revenue growth of 19.5%. For the full year, we continue to expect broadband revenue growth of 7% plus. Fiber ARPU of $68.61 was up more than 4% year-over-year with intake ARPU remaining above $70. Consumer wireline EBITDA grew 14.6% due to growth in broadband revenues and ongoing cost transformation. We now expect consumer wireline EBITDA to grow in the mid to high-single-digit range this year, driven by continued strong fiber revenue growth and disciplined cost management, partially offset by continued legacy copper declines. As our customer base continues to migrate to fiber from legacy services, our broadband support costs are decreasing, thanks to fiber's more efficient operating model, greater reliability and higher quality service. And while fiber remains our focus and lead product, we continue to be encouraged by the early performance of AT&T Internet Air, our targeted fixed wireless service, which is available in parts of 95 locations. We now have more than 200,000 AT&T Internet Air consumer subscribers, having added 110,000 in the quarter. Ultimately, we couldn't be more excited about the future of consumer wireline with AT&T fiber well positioned to lead our growth and AT&T Internet Air, helping us provide quality broadband service to customers, where we don't offer fiber. Now, let's cover business wireline on Slide 10. Business wireline EBITDA was down 16.5% due to faster than anticipated rate of decline for our legacy voice services. At the start of the year, we shared that we expected business wireline EBITDA trends to improve on a full year basis. However, due to faster than expected decline of legacy voice services, we now expect full year business wireline EBITDA declines in the mid-teens range versus our prior outlook of a decline of 10% plus or minus. As John mentioned, we're advancing several cost saving and productivity initiatives. This should benefit results in the second half of the year when we also have more favorable year-over-year comparison. As we transition this business, we believe our 5G and fiber expansion presents plenty of growth opportunities. We're already seeing this in some of the parts of our broader business solution results today. A great example is FirstNet, where wireless connections grew about 320,000 sequentially. We're also pleased with early demand for AT&T Internet Air for business, which we expect to benefit results in the second half of the year. Now let's move to Slide 11 for an update on our capital allocation strategy. Our approach to capital allocation remains deliberate. We're successfully balancing long-term network investment to fuel sustainable subscriber and service revenue growth, paying down debt and returning value to shareholders. We remain on track for full year capital investments in the $21 billion to $22 billion range versus approximately $24 billion in 2023. While our overall capital investment will be lower in 2024 compared to recent years, we continue to invest in key growth areas, given the compelling returns on these investments. In mobility, we are focused on modernizing our network through our Open RAN initiative and with fiber, we remain on track to pass 30 million plus consumer and business locations by the end of 2025. As we've stated before the better-than-expected returns, we're seeing on our fiber investment potentially expands the opportunity to go beyond our initial target by roughly 10 million to 15 million additional locations. This also assumes similar build parameters and a regulatory environment that remains attractive to building infrastructure. It's important to note that as we continue to build out our network this year, we expect to have lower vendor financing payments, while increasing the total investment we make directly into our networks, as we continue to invest in fiber expansion and wireless network transformation. In other words, we expect our total capital investment and capital intensity to decline this year even as we boost investments in our network. We also remain laser focused on deleveraging. Over the last four quarters, we reduced net debt by about $6 billion. At the end of March, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times and we're making steady progress on achieving our target in the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to address near-term maturities with cash on hand, and this quarter, we repaid $4.7 billion of long-term debt maturities. Looking forward, our debt maturities are very manageable and we are in a great position with more than 95% of our long-term debt fixed with an average rate of 4.2%. In addition to paying down debt, we reduced vendor and direct supplier financing obligations by about $2.3 billion during the quarter. This was partially offset by $400 million in additional proceeds on our securitization facility. These efforts highlight the quality of the free cash flow we're delivering. DIRECTV distributions in the quarter were $500 million compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023. For the year, and thereafter, we continue to expect DIRECTV cash distributions to decline at a similar rate to 2023 or by about 20% annually. With $3.1 billion in first quarter free cash flow, we've dramatically improved our free cash flow ratability just as we committed, we would last year. Looking forward, we still anticipate generating approximately 40% of our total 2024 free cash flow in the first half of the year and continue to expect full year free cash flow of $17 billion to $18 billion range. To close, I'm really pleased with our team's overall performance in the quarter. Despite managing through legacy declines, our strength in mobility and consumer wireline has us on pace to deliver on our full year consolidated financial guidance. Brett, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Brett Feldman : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Good to hear the reiteration of the 2.5 leverage target for early next year. It would be great if you could just go through how you're thinking about the various capital allocation alternatives, buybacks, dividend growth, deleveraging, the 10 million to 15 million fiber adds BEAD investments. Any other considerations? And how we should think about the profile, presumably this time, next year, we will be having a more fulsome conversation. But anything more you could add around that would be great. And then just housekeeping on the outage. Maybe you could just size the credit for us? And was there any impact on net adds in the quarter? Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, Simon. Simon Flannery : Good morning. John Stankey : So I don't know that I'm going to give you a whole lot more than what I previously said. I mean it's really good to have choices, and we clearly have choices coming up, and we've worked really hard to put ourselves in this position to do that. And I told you there would be a very deliberate process that the Board would go through to understand what they want to do, as those choices start to materialize, and we're in the middle of doing that. We are working through a pretty systemic process. And at the top of that, as you can well imagine, as we're very cognizant of a desire to ensure that we're treating our shareholders well and returning capital, where we can and doing it in a smart way. And so, as I've said before, we'll evaluate at that time where things like interest rates stand, we'll evaluate where we are on the dividend yield relative to the equity value, and where we have opportunities for reinvestment in the business and kind of understand what we think the right combination of those are. And we have a pretty deliberate approach to making that happen. I would give you some characterization right now, as we've worked really hard over the last couple of years to ensure we protect the dividend. And I think you've seen that we've done that, and we've put ourselves in a really strong financial position. That's paramount and important to us, as we move into this. You heard Pascal's comments that we feel pretty good about where the balance sheet sits today relative to what we're paying for the capital on the balance sheet and our abilities to manage that moving forward. I don't feel like we've got some immediate need to move differently than the trajectory we've been on. So if I was waiting, we'll be waiting against those other options that we think about and how we want to go and get the mix right. So I think you'll see more, as we get to the end of the year. As I said, the Board is working really hard on this issue and I don't want to take away any degrees of freedom and latitude they have to debate it and figure out what they want to do, given what's going on in the market at the time we arrive. On the outage, look, I'm upset that we had it. It's unfortunate we had it. The entire team feels responsible for it. We know we can do better. We've put in place an awful lot of steps to ensure that we do better moving forward. I think I'm confident that we have done that and I feel like we can operate better than what we exhibited on that particular morning. Now having said that, I'm really proud of the way they responded to the circumstances when they occurred, and they managed through the situation as well as could be expected. And in fact I think you see that in the metrics. You see that we had a really, really good churn quarter. Obviously, that wouldn't happen if we didn't do the right things with the customer base. I'm pleased relative to what I've seen reported so far in the industry of our customer growth. I'm sure there were a couple of days of maybe some suppressed activity as a result of the outage. I think it's probably something that's measured in days. It wasn't measured in weeks and months. But we feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Certainly, as you might guess, we have a variety of survey methodologies that we use and research with our customer base and prospective customers. Those indicators don't show me anything that causes me to be concerned about what transpired or what occurred. I think some of our recovery methods that we use with our customer base was -- they were the right decisions. And you've seen most of that reflected in the first quarter financials. There's a little bit that will drag into the second quarter based on how bill rounds go, but you should expect that you've seen the bulk of that move through our numbers. And I'm satisfied that where we ended up on service revenue growth and margins that, that was a strong quarter in aggregate, inclusive of what we had to do in terms of the credits. Simon Flannery : Excellent. Anything on BEAD? Yeah. Brett Feldman : Go ahead. Go ahead, Simon. John Stankey : Nothing that I think you know as I said last quarter, Simon, I think BEAD is a 2025 issue. It's not a 2024 issue. It doesn't feel like it's moving in any particular way. All that fast at the state level. And as I've also indicated, it's pretty clear to me that there's places, where we're going to be more energized about playing and places, where we're going to be less energized about playing based on how various states are approaching this. And I don't think there's anything right now, I can tell you point blank, we won't be coming back in with any revisions to our guidance or anything like that, that is relevant to 2024. I think as we through this year, there may be some incremental things that we talk about in 2025 in terms of how we choose to reinvest capital and where we choose to go. But it's not anything that I see right now that's front and center. Simon Flannery : Many thanks. Brett Feldman : All right. We'll take our next question now, operator. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Hey, thanks, again. Good morning, guys. First, it's sort of a follow-up to Simon's question on the data breach. That's a sort of a second quarter issue, but just want to make sure to see if there's any impact that you saw early in the quarter from the data breach. And then certainly, one of the themes that we're seeing here in the first quarter is the low upgrades and low churn environment. Do you expect that to continue despite the fact that we may have a sort of AI device launch later this year? And does that low churn environment give the industry and AT&T, in particular, pricing power as you look into the rest of the year? Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, John. I don't want to characterize this incorrectly, but there are a lot of things going on broadly beyond AT&T in the cyber environment. I'm sure you're all, obviously, consumers and -- are seeing the dynamics of what's happening. There's clearly -- the bad actors have stepped up a level in the last several months I think. And if I were to broadly step back and say, are we going to see more activity and more problems, partly because of just the activity level and how robust the business opportunities are for hackers and those that want to inflict bad act -- bad acts on folks. And partly, I think, because of reporting requirements, I expect you're probably going to see the noise level go up. What we have seen from our notification is very similar to the outage. I don't see anything in the customer metrics or anything that's going on that suggests that it creates a long-term issue on sentiment. That doesn't mean we don't take it seriously. That doesn't mean that we're not examining what happened back in 2019 and trying to understand what root causes are around that. Those actions are all underway. But it doesn't appear to me that it's doing anything to impact our business as we stand here today in 2024. But we'll continue to evaluate that and we'll continue to work through the dynamics that are occurring. I would tell you that on the upgrade rates and churn, we've seen, as I've said last quarter, a little bit of tapering in the industry. We expected that to occur. We expected upgrade rates to be a little bit more tempered than what we had seen last year. I don't see anything going on right now that suggests we're out of pattern to what our expectations were, as we set up plan for 2024. We'll probably see a little bit of ebb and flow each quarter. I'm not sure that I'm of the mindset that there's going to be something that occurs in the device portfolio that dramatically changes things in the latter part of the year. There'll be the usual holiday promotions. There'll be the usual devices and opportunities for individuals to create something that's special during the holidays. But that's a seasonal pattern we're accustomed to. And I think we'll be seeing things on the margin adjusting left and right. I just don't believe we're going to be into a cycle that's what I would consider to be an out of pattern cycle in any way, shape or form. And I'm going to give you the same answer I always give on where we are in pricing power. Look, I think the industry is healthy. I think as I've indicated before, we're coming off of policies that drove record levels of investment in the industry. I think all players are mindful after record levels of investment to try to yield the appropriate returns that you would have to get after making those things and I see that kind of dynamic occurring. I think I know we're mindful of it that we want to make sure that we're getting reasonable returns off that level of capital. And my observations of what I see being reported over the last couple of quarters is that others are doing the same and we're providing tremendous amount more value to customers. They're using 30% more of our product, 35% more every year. The performance of these networks is increasingly better. There's choices that are coming in and how they apply the use of the technology for mobile to fix. So one would expect that maybe there's an opportunity to change that value equation and continue to take a little price in places and we're going to continue to do that. Where we think certain products have that kind of staying power, I think we've been pretty consistent over the last couple of years of saying there's opportunities to do that. I think we've tried to stress with you when we do it. We're very mindful of doing it intelligently. I believe our churn numbers reflect that we've executed pretty well on that front. And I feel good about the fact that we've been able to drive our ARPUs up, keep our margins in check, if not improve them, and continue to do some things that take some price in certain places, where we think we can keep the value equation in check. And I expect we're going to continue to do that, as we move through this year. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, John. Brett Feldman : Hi, operator, we'll take our next question, please. Operator : Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Peter Supino : Hi. Good morning, everybody. A question about the mobility side. Obviously, the consolidated or segment results were really good. And looking at the EBIT growth, it's similar to the rate of service revenue growth in a quarter when gross adds and churn were lower, a great thing, less cost. And I'm just wondering why -- what else is happening in the cost structure, so that EBITDA wouldn't outgrow service revenue in a quarter like this? And then a quick one on Internet Air for business. Is your intent to distribute that nationally? Or will that be a more regional strategy in the way that IA has been so far in residential? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Peter, Pascal. How are you? In terms of EBIT and you're talking about operating income, that's inclusive of the depreciation, correct? Peter Supino : Yes, I am. Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Remember, we guided that as a result of the Ericsson Open RAN deal, we would have accelerated depreciation associated with some of the equipment that was previously in our network that we were going to depreciate over shorter lines. That's a dynamic you're seeing come through there. I feel really good about the overall expense management and overall cost profile and you see that coming through in our EBITDA margin expansion in that business. John Stankey : And Peter, we broadly, as I indicated in my remarks that we see Internet Air for business being a national product. You probably maybe noticed that you may not be a golfer, but you noticed during the masters, we kind of previewed some of our advertising that will be coming out on the product that's geared toward the business market segment. And it doesn't mean that it's a product for every business, but it certainly is a product for every state is what I would say. We want to be mindful of making sure that we match the product to businesses that have the right usage characteristics that we think we can provide a quality level of service and right value. There are many businesses that match that, and there are many businesses that have usage characteristics and behaviors that are atypical to a typical single-family dwelling. And that's why we think it's a good place to invest time, energy, money. And I think that was consistent with what our expectations were from the founding of the product and where we thought we'd go to market with it. Peter Supino : Understood. Thank you. Brett Feldman : Operator, we'll take next question, please. Operator : Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Kraft : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. John, can you talk about how you're balancing the marketing and sales budget today between customer acquisition and retention and how that's driving AT&T's performance relative to your competitors? I think one of the concerns we often hear from investors is that while churn has been great, gross adds have been down for several quarters, but I suspect this is at least partly a function of the strategy. So if you could shed some light there, that would be great? Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, Bryan. You've answered your question. It's intentional with the strategy. I'm more than happy to take gross in places, where I think I can drive gross profitably. And I think in some cases, we have to think about how much people are paying for growth, and then we also have to think about gross and we have to think about whether or not that gross really has yield on it, if it's what the end user is paying ultimately when they come on a network. And so, I think some of the numbers ultimately are what I refer to in my opening remarks, a bit low calorie. I don't really want to play in the low calorie space. I want to make sure I'm getting my fair share of the high calorie subscribers, and that's why we're focused on share of service revenues as maybe being a better benchmark of is the company balancing its growth in the right way? And when you think about how we balance our budget and what we do internally is we're pretty rigorous around asking ourselves those questions and the segments we attack, how we go after and the longevity. And look churn's a key driver when you're investing for that growth. And I'll take lower churn all the time. I don't think that's a bad sign necessarily. I'm perfectly okay with where we stand on that front. We've talked previously, Bryan, that one of the things I like about where we've been in the market and that I think is, frankly, sustainable probably 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago, most of the questions on this call is where's the growth coming from? And I kept saying the growth was balanced. It's coming from a lot of different segments. We're seeing it come from different parts of the business community, and we're giving you the fact that our business growth has been strong. We like what we're picking up in the residential environment, in the consumer environment, and where we see our growth coming from there in terms of what we're taking. So we have a pretty balanced approach to our distribution right now that I think that diversity is helpful. It diversifies our portfolio. It diversifies the base. And that's one of the reasons why the churn numbers are as strong as they are. Bryan Kraft : Thank you. Brett Feldman : Operator, we're ready for the next question? Operator : David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, first, a follow-up question, if I could. John, thank you for your comments about kind of having digested the impact of the outage, but the postpaid phone ARPU was obviously down about a little over 1% in the quarter, and I'm assuming at least some, if not all, of that had to do with the credit and the GAAP accounting for that. And so, I was wondering if we could get a -- maybe Pascal, a jumping off point from where ARPU really is if we normalize for that credit. And then second, another kind of housekeeping question is, with the sale of Sky Mexico back to, I think Televisa, what happens now? Like how does that affect the reporting, as we think about the rest of the year? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : All right. Hey, Dave, I can take both questions. First on postpaid phone ARPU, I'm assuming you're citing the sequential trend as opposed to year-over-year because we grew year-over-year. The sequential trend, a couple of things to keep in mind. Yes, the credit was a factor. But it was -- it's part of the mix and we told you at the time it was not significant, but it was still a factor in sequential trends. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is there is seasonality associated with international roaming, that there are periods, where international roaming is going to be higher than not, and that impacts ARPU as well. Overall, we feel really good about the guidance we gave for modest ARPU growth for the year. So nothing substantive there. And your second question was remind me. John Stankey : Sky Mexico. David Barden : Sky Mexico. John Stankey : It's a non-event. Pascal Desroches : It really is a non-event, Dave. We didn't consolidate it. It was an equity method investee that it wasn't in the context of AT&T, not a significant item. David Barden : Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could. Pascal, you said that we should expect a 20% rate of kind of run rate decline in DTV cash contributions on an annual basis, on a kind of go-forward basis? Is that the? Pascal Desroches : Yeah. That is our best judgment, yes. And that's the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and that hasn't changed. In Q1, there was some -- last year there were some one-time items and that's probably why you saw some of the decline year-over-year, but we feel good about the guidance we previously provided, which should put us at an around. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Pascal Desroches : Hello? Dave, are you still there? David Barden : I'm here. I'm listening. Pascal Desroches : Okay. David Barden : All of it. Pascal Desroches : Yeah. All right. Yeah. So for the year, we expect to have overall $3 billion of cash distribution from DIRECTV. David Barden : Appreciate it, guys. Thank you so much. Brett Feldman : All right. We'll take the next question now. Operator : Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks for taking the question and good morning. When we look at the EBITDA growth for first quarter of the 4.3% year-over-year and compare that to the guidance of 3% range for the full year. Can you just frame some of the elements that may be changing, whether it's by segment or between revenue and cash expenses just to think about the differences there? And then this could be a related question. Can you review your exposure to the ACP program, your expectations on the program possibly being discontinued and potential impact to AT&T's financial results? Thanks. Pascal Desroches : Okay. Mike, thank you for the question. Good morning. So first, as it relates to our segment level guidance, one, relative to the start of the year, as I noted in my comments, I anticipate business wireline will be a little bit worse than we thought, principally because of an acceleration of legacy voice decline. So putting that down in the mid-teens. But look you saw the strong start to both our mobility business including the record low churn. And consumer wireline, I mean, we delivered over 14% of EBITDA growth. And the dynamics for both, we would anticipate -- what you saw in Q1, we would anticipate being there for the balance of this year. Those businesses are operating really well. The transformation work, we've done the last few years is really setting us up to have margin expansion in those businesses, and we feel really good about the trajectory of those two businesses. Business wireline is, at an earlier point, in the product transition. And while we are growing fiber revenues, and as John mentioned, AT&T Internet Air for business, that's going to grow. And of course, the wireless business relationships will also grow, but those will be offset by legacy declines and we're confident we can manage through that in the balance of the year and still deliver on around 3%. John Stankey : Mike, I think we indicated last quarter, and is still no different position that we could work through the ACP sunset if, in fact, that occurs, then I would say it's probably more likely than not, that it does occur. And we could do so without any revisions or changes to what we guide you -- guided you to and we still feel that way. We've started the process, as you might guess, of notifying customers and working with them, and we're not just idly sitting by. I think we'll be successful in many instances, finding ways to continue relationships with customers and ease them into different constructs that make sense for them. But I feel good about how we went about using the program. I think we used it consistent with the way that policymakers probably would have liked to have seen it used, which is to over index more than anything else on fixed broadband capabilities. And I think we had a quality customer base relative to how the program was set up, and that's going to allow us to probably transition some of them into other approaches for how to use the service and those that we ultimately do lose because of the subsidy sunsets. I don't think it's going to be anything that impacts ultimately what we've given you in terms of our ability to operate the business and hit our financials. Brett Feldman : Great. Thanks, Mike. We'll go ahead for the next question. Operator : Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sebastiano Petti : Thank you. A couple of quick housekeeping questions. John, I think you talked about the balance growth on the mobility side. You have cited those are some underpenetrated segments. I was hoping you can give us an update on the opportunity there, I think SMB value and fiber selling on the mobility side. When do you expect to see some of the share gains, I guess, within some of these segments? Is that more of a -- is that -- could we see that within '24? Does that take some time to build '25 and beyond? And then on the business wireline side, I think, obviously, some focus there on the EBITDA trajectory, but you mentioned you are accelerating some cost cutting initiatives. Would that be within the context of the $2 billion cost cutting program? Or should we maybe think of these as additive to that program? Thank you. John Stankey : Good morning, Sebastiano. I would tell you that as we indicated, we've accelerated some of the work that we're doing. So this is things that probably would have occurred later in the cycle that we're moving forward. So we'll get some incremental run rate benefit to that, maybe and accelerating our forecast not necessarily changed endpoint, I guess, is the way I would describe that. And on our progress around, where we're trying to make sure that we're operating more effectively and how our channel distribution works within distribution, I would say that we've made some reasonable progress and have things in place around what we're able to do to penetrate fiber, where we don't have fiber on a wireless subscriber that is eligible to get fiber and the reverse of that. I feel pretty good about what we have lined up around that front. I think we're going to see progress in that regard, as we move through '24. We expected in our business plan and how we've communicated to you our performance that we would have progress in that regard. And I do think I'm starting to see the machine work the right way. We're working hard and trying to position ourselves in the value segment. I would say that it's been a little bit slower ramping in that space and specifically getting the right lineup and the right products in the right place. I do expect, as we move through this year, that we will make progress in that regard. Again, we expected we would make progress in that regard in terms of how we guided our expectations around the performance of the business and we'll keep pushing and working on it. And I would also say that it's probably the same statement and truth and where we see certain ethnic segments that maybe we could do a little bit better at than what we're doing right now and we'll continue to work those as well. Sebastiano Petti : Following up quickly, just on Mike's question about the ACP. Obviously, access from AT&T program was a portion within the commitment that you made earlier in the month. Do you see this as an opportunity to leaning in perhaps on access from AT&T as an opportunity to gain some share from ACP subs, who may be churning from peers? Or do you see this is an opportunity to lean in a little bit into the low-income segments to drive greater adoption of broadband over time? John Stankey : So we intend to continue to keep the access from AT&T in the market and we'll continue to actively promote it and try to apply it where it makes sense. And I think we're going to continue to see the same segments we were attempting when ACP was live to find that an attractive place to go. I'm -- I don't know exactly how some of our competitors have used the ACP subsidy. I know how I've used it. I think we've used it in a way, where we believe we're catching the waterfront of what we think are the right customers to be putting the subsidy in front of, which are the right customers that should get access from AT&T. Does that mean that incrementally we should see more coming back our way? I don't know. I would have intuitively hoped that in the form of the competitive markets in which we operate, that our message is equally communicating to those who chose us and those who didn't choose us. So I don't know that just because ACP goes away that I'm going to dramatically see that equation change. And so I don't expect there's going to be a strong pivot over to AT&T. And I hope or expect that our competitors might continue to leave some kind of a discounted offer in place for those that qualify for it. So I'm not expecting huge shifts as a result of that. Sebastiano, I'm pretty proud actually and comfortable given the overall state of the -- what I'll call the fixed broadband market of our performance and how we've been growing in that space. It's a big deal. We just hit 40% -- about 40% penetration of our fiber base right now. And if you'd ask me two years ago that I think we'd arrive at that level given the number of households we're adding and building to and I probably wouldn't have said that we'd arrive that quickly. So I think our goal is to just keep operating as effectively as we have been and taking the good growth that's coming our way. And I think you see that reflected in the overall performance of the numbers. Brett Feldman : Operator, we're going to take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. I want to delve in on the business side. First, can you give us your overall read on the economy and your outlook there? And then, secondly, what is sort of the endgame on the business wireline side? It continues to kind of decline. Is there a bottom there? And can you give us maybe a split between what's left in that revenue that's voice versus other data services to get an idea of where the weakness might be? Thanks. John Stankey : Yeah. Frank, so first of all, look, I don't -- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I think the shifts in the business segment are economic driven. I know there's been some discussion around what's happening in business investment and communication services. And I fully expect there are going to be businesses that look around and say, gosh, I need to find incremental money to invest in AI. And as we all know how our corporations that were part of work, sometimes it's -- you take from one to invest in another, and I expect we're going to see that happening. But I think the fundamentals under what's occurring in the business segment are largely technology driven. I think we've known for a long time that traditional voice had a shelf life. And ultimately it was going to get replaced with integrated communication services and as-a-service capabilities that run over the top of IP. I think what we saw is a bit during the pandemic, there was a suppression of change for whatever reason, people were out of the office. It wasn't a priority. People didn't want to mess around with their communications infrastructure, while they were working hard to accommodate a different hybrid work environment. And now we're kind of seeing that evolution kind of pick up with a degree of steam. There's probably some good business reasons that's occurring. People are rationalizing office space. They're moving things around. They're working differently. They're evaluating the kind of technology they want in place as a result of that. And that's, from my point of view, why we're seeing a little bit of that step-up in that voice transition and what's occurring. I think we're going to try to do some work with you broadly, not just specific to business, but we'll give you some transparency and visibility of what's left in the legacy businesses and what's going on around those things. As we move through this year, I think we're working on maybe some ways to schedule some of that for you, so you kind of get a sense of what's occurring there. I understand your desire to want to understand it. I think what I would balance that with is, as we stressed multiple times this morning, those things that we're investing in right now, we've got a really good, strong, solid growth business, and those growth business are built on 5G and fiber and businesses endgame is really no different. We're shifting to build a company that is good at selling 5G and fiber into business, and selling 5G and fiber into business, not just at the top end of the market for the Fortune 1000, but across the continuum of the market. And that's a bit of a transition for AT&T because I would say, where we made our bread and butter over the last decade, rightly or wrongly, has been at the top end of the market. And so as we shift and generate more revenues and more share out of the mid-portion of the market, we're having to rebuild some muscle and some distribution and the right product mix to attack that and we can do that. And the endgame is we will catch this decline and we'll ultimately catch the decline with connectivity-based services both in fiber and 5G. We're just going through that transition to make that happen. And unfortunately, as you know, some of the historic voice services are really high-margin services. They're being replaced with good margin services, but not quite as high. And it's going to be a little bit painful for a couple of quarters, as we move through this transition. But I have ultimate confidence that the AT&T brand plays incredibly well in business. All of our research suggests that. I have very high confidence that we walk in and we talk to businesses of any size about using AT&T for either their wireless or fixed connectivity, we're high in the consideration set and can win that business. And I have confidence that there was another generation of incremental services that go on top of that connectivity, as I alluded to in my opening remarks and what we're doing with Dynamic Defense is a good example, which is overlay incremental service that comes on top of the basic transport that allows us to scrub traffic on behalf of the customer to improve their security posture. I think there's a lot more of those things that can come on in the middle market, given the lack of sophistication, the lack of ability to have a full-time staff dedicated to those things. And I think that's just natural for us to extend our capabilities into that space. And I'm long-term bullish that it's the right thing for us to be in both the fixed and the wireless market, given our brand presence, our distribution channel capabilities and how we build products. Brett Feldman : All right. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Our last question in queue will come from the line of Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk : Thanks. John, I just want to get your kind of refreshed views on the fixed wireless market. If you look at Verizon, they've added a percentage point of overall wireless growth using fixed wireless. T-Mobile has added, I think, 160 basis points. We're seeing advertisements for, I guess, I think what you call free air or something like that. What do you think in terms of the growth opportunity here? And if you were able to get some additional spectrum or maybe even with your existing spectrum, as you've seen the usage from some of your early learnings, can this be as broad of an opportunity for you as it's been for Verizon and T-Mobile? John Stankey : Good morning, Wal. I think the short answer to the last part of your question is I don't intend to promote it in the market in the manner that Verizon and T-Mobile are promoting at the market. And I just I said on the sideline and I observed, I also see them doing some things right now to try to manage the dynamics around those product sets that are reflective of what I believe the ultimate outcome was going to be and what I've been saying for a period of time, which is wireless networks aren't particularly the best place to take a single-family home that streams hours and hours of video a day and try to serve them with a kind of $50 a month product or service. And I just don't see that as long-term sustainable or healthy growth of returns for the business. And I've been pretty consistent in saying that and I'm still consistent in saying that. And that's why we're making a choice in our capital allocation to invest more heavily in fiber, as the basis of which to make an investment that we think has a long runway and a long annuity stream and as a technology that has flexibility to deal with what we know is going to be continuing calls and demands on growth for high-performance networking in homes and businesses. Now having said that, I've also been very, very clear that there is a place for fixed wireless in our portfolio. And I don't believe my point of view on this has changed in any way, shape or form nor our execution's any different than that. I've said from the start that there are many businesses that do not have the characteristics of single-family homes. And as a result of that, fixed wireless can be a really effective way of meeting their needs and doing so at a value proposition, price and performance that makes sense for them, especially when you start to think about those companies that have a convergence of both fixed and mobility needs. It's a natural in those cases. And I'd like to participate in that market aggressively and I will go after it as aggressively as my competitors and picking up any of those business customers that I can on a national basis. And I think that's a margin accretive decision within the context of how we're allocating capital between spectrum investments and fiber investments. I've also said that in the consumer space there are places, where I would apply the technology. I gave a couple of specific examples. We have some places, where we have a good copper DSL base that we're in the process of deploying fiber and in some cases, fixed wireless can give better performance than what our copper network can deliver and we know that we'll be 12 months, 18 months from fiber deployment and we may want to hold some customers, offering them a better service, and we'll use it as a bridging or hold strategy for those customers that are high value to us. And we'll continue to use that technique, where we can. I've indicated that we will use it as an opportunity for us to turn down footprint. So where I've got small numbers of data customers in place, I need to get them off of fixed infrastructure that I ultimately want to shutter because that allows me to turn down a geography that is a low utilization geography and a low profitable geography on the fixed side. And I can turn out the lights, walk away, take cost out of business, I will do that. And I've also said we have some select markets, where our penetration levels in mobility are low and our spectrum position is high and we may choose in those markets to do some incremental marketing to do, as you indicated, to buy some incremental growth that we believe has a longer runway. So that's how the team is operationalizing around this. But in the end, when all those plays are put together, no, I don't think you're going to see us have the same posture that two of our competitors do because our posture is different. We're investing in fiber and I don't see myself moving into the market just to buy spectrum, so that I can change the operating posture I just described to you. Brett Feldman : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. Operator, you can go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference call for today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to AT&T's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Brett Feldman, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. I'm Brett Feldman, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings, results may differ materially. Additional information, as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thank you, Brett. I appreciate you joining the call. Hard to believe we are already halfway through the year, but we are and our team delivered solid second quarter results as we continue to grow the right way by efficiently adding high-value wireless and broadband subscribers. Our strong start to the year is built on the foundation of what our team has accomplished over the past four years. As a result of this hard work, we're now repositioned around our connectivity strengths. This puts us on a clear path to becoming the leading provider of converged 5G and fiber services. Since Pascal will go through the quarter in detail, I'd like to spend some time highlighting how our team's execution of our investment-led strategy is driving consistent results. In Mobility, we delivered 419,000 postpaid phone net adds in the second quarter and 768,000 during the first half of the year. This put us modestly ahead of last year's pace despite ongoing wireless market normalization. And we're not just growing customers. Our Mobility EBITDA grew by more than 5% in the second quarter, driven by more than 3% growth in service revenue and 100 basis points of service margin expansion. We're delivering consistent results by keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. It's a winning play that we continue to run. The efficient first-half growth we achieved in our Mobility business positions us well for the back half of the year when we expect higher activity levels driven by the availability of new devices and features, seasonal purchasing activity, and promotional cycles. In Consumer Wireline, we added broadband subscribers for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by consistent growth in AT&T Fiber and early success with AT&T Internet Air. Once again, this story is about growing both customers and profitability as our Consumer Wireline business delivered more than 7% EBITDA growth during the second quarter. This was driven by approximately 18% growth in fiber revenues and improved operating leverage as we transition from legacy networks to advanced broadband infrastructure. While some portions of our business are still being pressured as customers transition off legacy voice and data services, our significant investment in 5G and fiber and consistent execution is driving durable growth across the large majority of our business. I expect this performance to continue, putting us on track to deliver on our full-year financial guidance. The durable trends in 5G and fiber are being driven by more than the solid individual execution within each business. We believe the success of our fiber business is driving growth in mobility and vice-versa as consumers increasingly prefer to purchase mobility and broadband together as a converged service. For example, today, nearly four out of every 10 AT&T Fiber households also choose AT&T as their wireless provider. As a result, our share of postpaid phone subscribers within the AT&T Fiber footprint is about 500 basis points higher than our national average. In our fiber business, we continue to achieve key penetration milestones faster than we anticipated and considerably faster than the fiber providers that do not operate wireless networks based on publicly available data. A key reason for the strong performance is our ability to sell fiber to our mobile customers. Additionally, we're able to reach new broadband customers through our substantial mobile distribution channels. The key point here is that our proven ability to drive higher share in both mobility and broadband through converged service penetration is the true benefit of owning and operating both 5G and fiber networks at scale. Over time, we expect this to drive greater returns on invested capital in both our mobility and broadband businesses than either would be expected to achieve as standalone operations. While our convergent strategy began with a focus on our owned fiber footprint, we also see attractive opportunities to expand the availability of AT&T Fiber, and our converged offers outside of it. This includes the continued scaling of our Gigapower joint venture and through capital-light arrangements with other providers of commercial open-access fiber networks. We expect the continued expansion of AT&T Fiber, both in-footprint and outside of it will enable us to drive significant growth with converged customers. Ultimately, our convergence strategy closely aligns with our primary focus over the last four years, growing in a durable, sustainable and efficient way. We still have a lot to accomplish as we execute this strategy, but I am encouraged by our momentum and see a long runway of growth with 5G and fiber together. More importantly, I like the distance between us and our competitive set with respect to our positioning to organically address more customers more profitably. Our commitment to our investment-led strategy has played a pivotal role in our success and made AT&T the largest capital investor in the U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. In addition to our ongoing network investment, we continue to reduce our net debt and leverage due to a combination of higher EBITDA and growing free cash flow. We expect these trends to continue and remain on pace to meet our target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5 times range in the first half of next year. This should provide us with greater financial flexibility to support sustained investment in growth, as well as enhanced shareholder returns. We're excited about what all this means for the future of AT&T. And given that our direction remains constant and our performance consistent, I'm going to avoid belaboring what we've been discussing for a number of quarters now. I turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing our second quarter financial summary on Slide 7. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations with revenues down slightly as a decline in Business Wireline service revenue and low-margin mobility equipment revenues offset growth in higher-margin wireless service revenues and fiber revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was up 2.6% for the quarter as growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline in Mexico, which collectively drove more than 80% of our total revenue in the quarter were partially offset by continued declines in Business Wireline. In the first half, adjusted EBITDA grew 3.4%, and we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range for the full year. Adjusted EPS was $0.57 compared to $0.63 in the year-ago quarter. Consistent with 1Q, the quarter includes about $0.09 of aggregated EPS headwinds from the four items we discussed earlier this year. For the full-year, our expectations remain for adjusted EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. We generated second quarter free cash flow of $4.6 billion, up nearly $400 million year-over-year. This is the result of sustained growth in adjusted EBITDA, improved conversion of EBITDA into free cash flow, and lower capital investment. Capital investment for the quarter was $4.9 billion, down $1 billion compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of lower payments for vendor financing. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion, up approximately $100 million compared to the prior year. We remain on track for capital investments in the $21 billion to $22 billion range for the year with higher spending in the back half of the year as we ramp our wireless network modernization. The quarter also included a lower net impact from securitization of $1.5 billion relative to last year's second quarter. Now, let's look at our Mobility operating results on Slide 8. For the quarter, we delivered 419,000 postpaid phone net-adds, up from 326,000 a year ago. This improvement was driven by a 9 basis point decline in churn to 0.70%. We grew Mobility service revenues by 3.4% driven by strong execution and our balanced go-to-market strategy. Postpaid phone ARPU was $56.42, up 1.4% year-over-year, largely driven by higher ARPU on legacy plan. As expected, service revenue growth was partially offset by lower equipment revenues with a postpaid upgrade rate of 2.9%, which was down slightly from 3.1% last year. For the year, we continue to expect modest postpaid phone ARPU growth and Mobility service revenue growth in the 3% range. Mobility EBITDA of $9.2 billion grew 5.3%, or by more than $450 million year-over-year as we converted over 85% of our service revenue growth into EBITDA. During the first half of 2024, Mobility EBITDA grew 6.1%, and we continue to expect Mobility EBITDA growth in the higher end of the mid-single-digit range for the full year. As John noted during his remarks, our Mobility outlook anticipates higher activity levels in the back half, consistent with seasonal trends. In particular, we anticipate higher marketing spend in the third quarter compared to last year. We also expect to see greater benefits from our announced pricing actions in 4Q versus 3Q. Based on our strong subscriber and EBITDA growth through the first half of the year, we believe our Mobility business is well-positioned to capitalize on a more dynamic wireless market in the back half while achieving our financial targets. Now, let's move to Consumer Wireline on Slide 9. Our growth in Consumer Wireline was once again led by fiber subscriber growth, which has consistently yielded strong returns. Overall, we added 52,000 total broadband subscribers in the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive broadband net gains and we expect this trend to continue. Where we have fiber, we win, and we added 239,000 AT&T Fiber subscribers in the quarter. Our 2Q AT&T Fiber net adds are consistent with the three primary drivers of quarterly net-add variability that we've previously shared. These are the pace at which we put new fiber locations into service, which is the largest variable in any given quarter as new inventory we're able to serve can fluctuate. Second, overall broadband market dynamics which have remained fairly stable. And finally, typical seasonality. We expect these to remain the primary drivers of quarterly trends in AT&T Fiber net-adds in the back half of the year. And as a reminder, the third quarter typically has favorable seasonality relative to the second quarter. We now pass nearly 28 million consumer and business locations with fiber and remain on track to pass 30 million-plus fiber locations by the end of 2025. As we've stated before, the better-than-expected returns we're seeing on our fiber investments potentially expands the opportunity to go beyond our initial build targets by roughly 10 million to 15 million additional locations. This assumes similar build parameters and a regulatory environment that remains attractive to building infrastructure. We are also encouraged by early performance of AT&T Internet Air and our success in proactively migrating customers with legacy copper-based Internet connections onto this fixed wireless service. We now have AT&T Internet Air in parts of 137 markets with nearly 350,000 total consumer subscribers, including 139,000 added during the quarter. Second quarter broadband revenues grew 7% due to strong fiber revenue growth of approximately 18%. For the full year, we continue to expect broadband revenue growth of 7% plus. Fiber ARPU of $69 was up $2.30 year-over-year with intake ARPU remaining above $70. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 7.1% as growth in broadband revenues and ongoing cost transformation continue to improve profitability. We still expect Consumer Wireline EBITDA to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit range this year. Now, let's cover Business Wireline on Slide 10. Business Wireline EBITDA was down 13.9% due to continued industry-wide secular declines in legacy voice services consistent with the trends we discussed last quarter. The reported decline in EBITDA slightly improved in 2Q versus the first quarter. This primarily represents benefits from favorable timing of anticipated items and early traction on cost-saving initiatives. Looking into the back half of the year, I want to remind you that we benefited from approximately $100 million of IP sales in the third quarter of last year that are not expected to recur next quarter. So the year-on-year trend in Business Wireline EBITDA is likely to see some pressure in 3Q before improving in 4Q as comparisons ease. Also, I'd like to note that 2Q results included less than one month of revenues from our cybersecurity business prior to deconsolidating its operations into a joint venture. On average, this low-margin business contributed about $100 million in quarterly revenues. The key point is that Business Wireline is performing in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. So for the full year, we still expect Business Wireline EBITDA decline in the mid-teens range. While near-term declines in legacy voice revenues are likely to weigh on Business Wireline EBITDA trends for the remainder of the year, our 5G and fiber expansion continue to present attractive growth opportunities in business solutions. This includes sustained growth in FirstNet, which now has more than 6 million total connections. Similarly, we're excited about the potential we have with emerging growth products like AT&T Internet Air for business, which we launched nationwide, and Dynamic Defense. Now, let's move to Slide 11 for an update on our capital allocation strategy. Our approach to capital allocation remains consistent and deliberate. We're successfully balancing efficient growth with long-term investments in delivering converged network services to more customers, paying down debt, and returning value to shareholders. We remain focused on deleveraging and have reduced our net debt by about $2 billion year-to-date. At the end of June, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was below 2.9 times and we're making steady progress on achieving our target in the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. We continue to address near-term maturities with cash-on-hand and this quarter, we repaid $2.2 billion of long-term debt maturities. Looking forward our debt maturities are very manageable and we are in a great position with more than 95% of our long-term debt fixed with a weighted average rate of 4.2%. In addition to paying down debt, we reduced direct supplier and vendor financing obligations by about $700 million versus the first quarter. Additionally, the second quarter net impact from securitization facilities was a $700 million use of cash. These efforts highlight the improving quality of free cash flow we're delivering. We expect to continue reducing our aggregate net balance of direct supplier and vendor financing on a year-over-year basis, which should lower our interest expense and continue to improve cash flow ratability over time. DIRECTV distributions in the quarter were about $740 million, and we continue to expect DIRECTV cash distributions to decline at a similar rate to 2023, or by about 20% annually. We generated $4.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $7.7 billion in the first half of the year. Free cash flow is up $2.5 billion compared to the first half of last year, which is consistent with our goal of driving more ratable free cash flow. Looking into the second half of the year, we expect cash taxes to be a billion dollars higher compared to the second half of last year. We also expect to incur a onetime payment of $480 million in the third quarter related to our wireless network transformation. Overall, we're on pace to deliver on our full-year free cash flow guidance in the $17 billion to $18 billion range. To close, I'm very pleased with our team's performance in the first half of the year and we're on pace to deliver on all of our full-year financial guidance. Brett, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Brett Feldman : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. A couple if I could. First, John, you talked about higher activity levels in the second half in wireless, and obviously, there's a lot of concern about upgrade rates with the new iPhone. I mean, are the comments that you made just a function of sort of typical seasonality, are you expecting sort of a new upgrade sort of initiative? And what does that mean? If so, what does that mean for the levels of churn we've been seeing in profitability and sort of overall competition in the space? That's number one. And then number two, you had some comments about Gigapower and the potential open-access relationships. As it relates to Gigapower, any color you can give us on how that relationship or partnership is doing in terms of rollout and customer uptake? And then is there room for more of these relationships with other third-party open access providers? Are you talking to anyone else and how big could that opportunity be? Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, John. How are you? So on your first question, first, I'd start out by saying whatever happens going forward, we've been focused on ensuring that we try to set up the business to respond to what the customer wants to do with their accounts and keep that a focus of what we think our strategy ought to be and how we go-to-market. And I think it's important to understand that whatever happens going forward is going to be a factor how customers decide to do things. And I think we'll be positioned as a company to deal with that either way. There is seasonality. First of all, as you know, when we get into a new device cycle coming out from typically one of the handset providers, there's a little bit of a suppression effect that occurs a month or two before they go to market, and then there is an increase in acceleration that occurs. And as you heard both Pascal and I talk about, we've expected that that cycle is going to continue, and I think we're in a good position with our guidance to be able to adjust to whichever way it goes. I've looked at some of the notes that have been written recently about sizing and looking at this particular dynamic. And I think that they're directionally consistent when you start thinking about the reality that we have accounts that have discrete handsets that mature in their cycles at different times. You typically don't have an entire account, at least in how we built our customer base that gets to a upgrade cycle all at the same time. So we're able to kind of look at history and understand a little bit about it. And if the customer decides that there is meaningful features in the new devices, we're going to respond to it. We're going to deal with it. But I feel like we're in pretty good shape to make that happen one way or another. Now whether or not there is something more compelling in this cycle, frankly, none of us know exactly what's going to come in. We do have some reference points. There have been other AI devices that have come into the handset ecosystem over the last couple of months. I haven't seen anything in them that suggests to me it's going to cause customers to immediately say this is world-changing for them, but it doesn't mean that somebody doesn't unlock the key at some point. Typically these feature enhancements take one or two cycles to get them right and ultimately bring them forward, but time will tell remains to be seen. I would also say that there's a lot of ways you can experience AI without having to necessarily change out hardware per se. I mean, we're already seeing that in ways that AI is implemented into search and browsers and things like that. So how customers get comfortable with it and start to adopt it, we'll watch and I think we'll go through the cycle. And if there's a little bit of spike at the front-end and then it slows down a little bit later, we've been through those cycles before and we'll do fine. Pascal, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Pascal Desroches : You know, John, I would just add one thing. When you look at our performance for the overall Company as well as Mobility, we are running ahead halfway through the year of the full-year guidance that we gave. And so whatever the environment is, I feel like we are incredibly well-positioned for it. John Stankey : On your question about where we are with Gigapower, I'm going to defer the answer to your question. I plan -- I think I told you when we started this that I owed good insight and transparency on the data to the investment community around how we perform. And I kind of put a benchmark out there and we did that said we needed 18 months to go through what I consider to be a reasonable cycle of investment of turning the product up, getting into markets and penetrating it, getting an update to understand how we're performing. And we will be at that point right about it, Communacopia, and I expect I'll probably spend a little bit of my time at that session giving you the kind of insight you'd like. And I would tell you I'm looking forward to that opportunity to have that conversation. And my belief is we have a lot of opportunity to grow profitably on fiber and convergence in a variety of different models. And it's -- go back to the remarks I just made, we understand how to sell both products together, number-one. And I think as I move around the industry, one of the things I pick up, I'm being shared with those that we can partner with is, I think people notice that we seem to have a formula that's different in its capabilities and its effectiveness than maybe what they see occurring in other pockets around the United States. And so I think we are acknowledged of being pretty competent in this area and I'd like to press my bets in that regard. And we've done things such as, as you would expect, we do. One, we're not selling fixed wireless broadly across the footprint. So I think our competitive positioning with partners looks a little bit different than some. Two, because we did Gigapower, we built a back office for Gigapower that already has a wholesale relationship structure that works with AT&T and the Gigapower entity where we make that available to others. And if somebody wants to use that infrastructure and use it as a means to jointly market our products and services where our wireless can help their fixed assets, and we view that as being a very helpful dynamic of somebody who is trying to get scale. So I do see further runway and opportunity there for us to do more and we're active in that space and you should expect that as we move forward and we continue this race to convergence. It's one of the tools that we're going to do to put distance between ourselves and everybody else. John Hodulik : Thanks, gentlemen. Brett Feldman : All right. Operator, we'll take the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Good morning. And I think we managed to get this far without mentioning ACP. I wonder if you could just give us an update on what you've seen so far, what do you expect in the third quarter? And then coming back to the comment about in-region fiber, you've talked a few times about the 10 to 15. I think you're almost at 28 million locations, pretty near that 30 million. So help us understand where you are on that evaluation process and what should we expect in terms of you giving us a new kind of map for the next three years, or whatever, and how that flows through to CapEx, et cetera. Thanks. John Stankey : Good morning, Simon. On ACP, I think we indicated to you probably last quarter, maybe even the quarter before. Pascal Desroches : Start of the year. John Stankey : Yes, that we would be effective at working through this. We didn't see it as being material or significant. And I characterize that we saw no reason we continue to be able to deliver on our commitments back to you. And that is in fact happening and will happen. We are most of the way through the ACP effect. Has there been an effect, sure, a little bit. It's not the sole reason we're a little bit down on fixed broadband this quarter. There's other reasons moves are continuing to be a bit suppressed is one of them. Seasonally, second quarter tends to be down a bit. But we had a little bit of an impact because of some adjustments that were made going through that. But the vast majority of our customers, most importantly, we know who these customers are, right, because we know that they're getting the discount are through a transition process and we feel fine about it. I'm pretty proud and pleased with how our prepaid business performed this quarter. It had some impacts from ACP associated with it. But I think if you look at where we were with churn and where we were with gross adds and net adds in that space, I think we came through it and demonstrated that we had good-quality customers who still need to use the service one way or the other and we've accommodated them. So we still got a couple of people hanging out there on some what I will call transitional promotions. I expect that there'll be a little bit of shrink in some of those transitional promotions. They're all following our expectations as we calculated what we thought the impacts are going to be. They're all consistent with the guidance that we have been giving you. So I wish we hadn't had to go through this with our customer base. We did, but I think we've handled it well and we're largely through the impacts at this juncture and moving on to do other good growth. In terms of where we are, we've been very clear that we'll give you kind of an update on our capital allocation strategy as we approach this 2.5 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio in the first half of next year. I would expect that as we go through our normal cycle toward the end of the year here as we start to give guidance for next year, you'll get what you need in terms of moving forward. And I don't think there's going to be any shocks in this. Our priorities remain the same. We want to make sure we can continue to grow the business. That's first and foremost. I want to leave a business to whoever sits in my chair later that has a good strong sustainable franchise that can be healthy and that the next generation of individuals that work at this Company feel confident and proud about where the Company is going to go. And we'll invest in a way that we make sure that we have that capability and that kind of a franchise built. Then of course, we want to continue to maintain our commitments to our bondholders and our dividend, and those are what I would say the top three. But as you know, we'll have some optionality to go beyond that as we get into next year. And I think we'll be very deliberate about that. The Board is being very deliberate about it right now. We're spending multiple cycles on it. We're spending a lot of time looking at scenarios. I think we'll continue to invest in growth in this business at some level in some way, but I also believe we have optionality to change our formula around how we return to shareholders. And I think you'll see us employ the right approach to that. Brett Feldman : We're ready for the next question. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. First on fiber side. Relative to the long-term fiber passings target of $45 million -- $40 million, $45 million, which we talked about, can you help us understand whether you're seeing stronger returns and actually accelerating the pace of build-outs from here? And how roughly would you expect that pace of additions or passings to add to the trend in 2025? And then secondly, in terms of Internet Air, you mentioned that it's now available for business nationally. Does that imply that the run-rate of net-adds could accelerate materially in the coming quarters? And how much headroom do you see in your overall network capacity relative to adding business fixed one -- fixed wireless subscribers? Thank you. John Stankey : Hi, good morning, Jim. So our fiber targets as Simon alluded to earlier, it's 30 million passings by next year. And we're well on our way to doing that, and you can check the box if that's going to occur. And as I just said, I expect that with what we've been seeing and the performance of fiber, and I've been pretty clear about this for our in-region organically developed and built fiber, our returns on the overall investment portfolio have been better than we expected when we kind of started into this process in the call it the 2014-'15 timeframe. And we're giving you some additional insight this quarter as you now understand what some of the strengths are as we get into these markets where we begin to have some scale in the fiber footprint that we can jointly market, both wireless and fixed together. So that's a really powerful combination for us. And that return characteristic, I would say is still call it in the early innings. We still have a ways to go. As you saw by the numbers we put out there, it's great progress. It's clearly, I think probably the strongest in the industry, but there's still a lot of headroom in there. And I think to the extent that we fine-tune that play and we begin to bring in some of the product innovation that we want that's joint between these things and the service innovation, we can do even better and improve that return. Hence, you know my comment to Simon's or my answer to Simon's question, do I think we're going to continue to invest in growth moving forward and move beyond 30 million passings? I think the answer to that is probably exactly what that number is in pace. We'll give you a little bit more color as we get into the latter part of this year and make sure that we've got the Board 100% where we -- we're all in the same mindset around that. And as I said, we're going through that process right now to make sure we're deliberate. I think one of the things that you should keep in mind as we go through that is what I said to John. We have a lot of tools of which we can go in and put a good converged offer in place and a lot of ways to do it. And I think because our financial returns have been as strong as they are, there's a lot of capital out there available and people want to enable partner and there's a lot of ways we can go about doing this, whether that's through capital-light approaches with straight wholesale and becoming a good partner to others that are building or doing partnership arrangements or doing organic build. And I think we're going to take advantage of all three and we can do that in a way that drives really good returns back into the business that everybody looks at and says that makes a lot of sense. In terms of where we are on the Internet Air run rate, you should expect that we're going to continue to grow and you'll see improvements in our rates associated with that. But I don't want you to take that and say that that's an artifact of a change in strategy. We are executing the strategy we put out. And again, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I've articulated that our strategy is a bit different than others. We're not broadly offering Internet Air everywhere we do business. We're being selective in how we do that. We're doing it in places where it makes sense to aid our transition from legacy technology to new technology that helps us take cost out of the business. We're doing it in places where we have very fallow capacity that we can be confident will be long-lived in nature and not something that we end up having to incrementally invest in two years out after we sell into the market. We're doing it, as I said last quarter, any place the right business customer wants to buy it will sell it. And that means whether we've got capacity or not, the business product is a different product. The business product has different usage characteristics. The business product has different ARPU characteristics and the business product has different characteristics around how you can bundle and serve multiple products together. And so I feel very comfortable in a nationwide offer on business that when we pick up the right customer there and how we employ that capability, either for primary or backup that we can profitably add it to other portfolios into our service offerings and reinvest in it in a way that makes sense for the business. So you'll continue to see us scale further in the business market. We're still getting the distribution tuned and honed in that space, and I would expect you see improvement in our numbers in the business segment as we move forward in the coming quarters. Jim Schneider : Thank you. Brett Feldman : Are you ready for the next question, operator? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. John, I wanted to maybe go back to something you just said, which was that there's a race to convergence in the market. And I think that not everyone agrees that that's a true statement, that maybe it's more of a race for AT&T to exploit the opportunity it has in its footprint to converge as much as possible. You mentioned that you've got a 500 basis point market-share advantage in the areas where you've deployed fiber. Could you kind of share more data that would support your argument that there should be a race to convergence that AT&T is in a unique position to take advantage of these economics beyond simply market share? And then if I could, the second question would be there's been a series of events over the course of the year, network outages, data breaches, disclosures about previous data breaches. Is there anything that we need to know about how that's impacting either your go-to-market or the possibility of future financials? Thank you. John Stankey : Hi. Good morning, Dave. So look, I -- you will get more and more as we move forward over time. I think I gave you just a lot of insight with what we shared today, and I'm not necessarily going to tick off other things that we look at, but you should conclude a couple of things. One, our combined customers are happier customers. They have lower churn and they have longer lifetime values. Why raise the convergence because that's a good way to make money and it's a good way to keep customers in the fold. And I don't know, I hope not everybody believes that's the right strategy. I think it is. We're going to continue to push the pedal on it because we're uniquely positioned to do it well. And that's what I think is the exciting thing about this Company. We have an opportunity for great organic growth and organic investment that allows us to control our own destiny. And when part of that is constructed around a share take dynamic, we don't necessarily have to tie ourselves to the overall growth of the market and whether, or not there's growth in fixed broadband connections we can play into we just want somebody else's connection. And I think we're demonstrating that we can do that effectively. So maybe that's why it's more important to me than somebody else who's already a dominant player in the space and wants to think about it in a different lens. And when I say race, I mean, this race is going to take place over years. It's not going to take place in a quarter or a year or two years. It's a reordering of assets. And I think if it's done right, it's going to be really, really effective. I think customers are another driver behind this race. I don't think customers intuitively love to have more relationships in their life with suppliers of critical services to them than they have to. I think they like to have a few trusted relationships if it works well. And so whoever figures that out over time, whoever can give the customer great value and ensure for them that wherever they go around the globe at whatever time, either through organic owned and operated relationships or third-party aggregation can be the one place that somebody goes to get that connectivity, I think that's a winning combination. And I believe the person that does that the best will ultimately return the best in this industry and gain scale the best. So that's my rationale behind it and where we're going, and I think that's our true north of how we think about orienting this Company, how we're thinking about product development, how we're thinking about how we want to structure pricing plans. We're just keeping that in the back of our mind over the next decade because I think that's where the management team needs to go and what needs to happen. And I understand this will be a race that we fight year after year after year. It's not quarter after quarter after quarter. Look, going to your second question, there's nobody more disappointed that we have to actually address your question and work through these issues than I am. And I know that all of my coworkers here share that same disappointment that we've had some instances where we've let down our customers. Now having said that, I think we've done the right things in responding to it. We care about our reliability. We care about how well we run this business from a privacy and a data security perspective. I think we know how to do those things. We are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment on two fronts. One, we're changing a lot in our business, which is necessary, and I'm proud of the changes we've been making and I'm proud of the progress we're making, but it comes with a lot of moving parts. And two, the threat environment we're in is a really, really difficult environment and it's going to get probably more difficult. Some of the geopolitical dynamics that are going on are putting pressure on that. Good companies just like ours are all having to learn some new things and are seeing new threats and new environments that they have to adjust to. And unfortunately, because we have a big large customer base, I think there's a little bit more focus put on the kind of missteps or issues and learnings that we might go through versus some others from time to time. But everybody is dealing with this problem. What I'm proud of is how we've dealt with it. We've been responsive. We've done it in a way that I think we've taken good action to learn from those things internally. We've been transparent with our customers around what the circumstances are. I think we've stood behind our product in those instances. We are, I think, navigating that from a communications perspective from all evidence that I see data-wise in a way that we are doing as good a job maintaining our customers' confidence as I could hope. And I'm not dismissing the issue in any way, shape or form. I view it as very, very important. It's clearly something I don't ever wish to go through, but we've handled it about as well as we can going through it. And as I've indicated to you and as Pascal indicated to you, we feel confident in our financial guidance going forward. We feel confident in our public statements and filings that we've made on these subjects where we describe the fact that these are not material to the performance of the business. And that's where we stand today, and we're going to continue to strive every day to do better and not have this conversation again. David Barden : Thanks, John. Brett Feldman : Are we ready for the next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sebastiano Petti : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Pascal, I just wanted to see if I could -- if we could follow up perhaps on the -- I believe it was $480 million one timer to -- in the back-half of the year that you anticipate from the wireless transformation. Maybe a little bit of color on what that is and perhaps was this fully contemplated within guidance at the beginning of the year? And then an additional question for John. Just try to help us think about given where we are from an FCC perspective with a lack of spectrum authority, maybe lack of a pipeline as well on the spectrum side, how are you and the team perhaps thinking about spend and augmentation of the wireless network, or how you're planning around that just kind of given those two dynamics? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Hi, Sebastiano. In terms of the payment we expect to make is we've said -- we reported late last year that we were entering into a new agreement and that as part of that, we'd be phasing out one of these -- one of one of our vendors. And we expected some level of determination payment associated with that. And whether or not that was contemplated in our guidance, I'm not going to get into but we are very comfortable sitting here today that we are going to be able to pay that and still deliver on our full-year commitments. John Stankey : Hi, Sebastiano. So to answer your question, first of all, I think it's important to frame that it starts with a point-of-view that we view capacity as being a fixed resource that has to be managed very, very carefully, and so made some comments earlier about our point-of-view around fixed wireless and how we deploy that spectrum and where we deploy that capacity. I mean, it ties into a point-of-view of how do we invest in the network moving forward and how do we monetize that scarce resources effectively as we can. And that's part of our planning, and look, the good news is we put a lot of capacity out there over the course of the last couple of years and we have a little bit more to go. But we're using that wisely. We're being very deliberate around how we deploy it. We want to make sure we give ourselves the longest runway to return as we can. And I think our strategies are directly proportional to that. And I don't think you should disconnect our investment in fiber from the fact that we've got spectrum planning issues to do and I'll get to maybe that part in just a minute. All right. We think that a good way to pick up high-density traffic in places is to do it over fiber, not to do it over wireless. And so that's a difference and maybe my point-of-view on to Dave's question, convergence, and how the market develops over time and trying to be deliberate in how we do capital allocation. Now in the near term, I expect we're going to be using every trick in the book as we historically do to ensure that we can deal with the 30% growth. One trick in the book is you continue to advocate for policy change. And I've been pretty vocal. I mean, I -- you go and look in some of the comments I've made, I've gone out of my way to walk into some public forums to say that I do not think spectrum policy in this country is on the right path right now. And that change could come possibly with a change of posture from the existing administration, which may get tweaked and adjusted by a new leader or by an administration change. And that's important because I think there are things we can do from a policy side to improve the availability of spectrum, which is the most effective way to increase capacity in a network, and we'll continue to advocate and push for those changes as we move forward. Second, there are some options in the secondary market. Some of them that will be available through normal course and frankly, some others that could be made available if there were some policy and spectrum adjustments made to how particular spectrum assets that have been put into the speculator market that they're out there could potentially be used and put to use. And I think a good policy for this country right now would be that for everything that we have licensed that we'd want it to actually be invested in and turned into service. And it seems to me that, that would be a good thing, especially when this country is behind other countries like China and other regions of the world and getting licensed spectrum into service. So I would suggest that if we look at that, there is some near-term opportunity to use existing licensed spectrum that's out there by just tweaking some rules and doing some things differently to get investment in it and actually, get capacity in. Third, we talked about what we're doing around O-RAN. And I think if you go back to my comments, I shared with you that one of the reasons we think that it's so critical that we open these interfaces up and we take this step is to play in the next generation of wireless deployment. It's in more distributed radiation points rather than macro sites, and to get the benefits of openness in the cost curves, in the flexibility. I've seen those interfaces open and getting a multi-vendor environment and then using our dense fiber assets that we're deploying is a match made in heaven to be able to deal with that growth in a more cost-effective way. And so that's a deliberate aspect of our strategy as to why we're doing O-RAN the way we're doing, why we're thinking about O-RAN is busting open the smaller cell structure to get more innovation, more providers, and how to then layer that on top of the fact that we're putting denser fiber reaches into our network that allows for us to take advantage of that. That allows for a more efficient growth of capacity as we move forward. So I would tell you that I think we've got a lot of tools in place to be able to do this, but it starts with market discipline around how you sell the product and service. And I feel like we're in a pretty good shape around our mix of fixed and mobile assets and how we're thinking about that evolution of convergence. Brett Feldman : I think we're ready for our next question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Two topics, if I could. First, on Mobility, just curious if you could further unpack where the strength in the postpaid phone net adds came from during the quarter, and if you're seeing any changes in the competitive landscape with some of the adjustments to the promotional strategies from some of the cable and M&O competitors? And second, on the cost structure, curious if you could share your progress on the multi-year cost-cutting targets, and how you're looking at the durability for EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis to potentially outpace the consolidated service revenue performance. Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Michael. So look, I would tell you the story really isn't a whole lot different than it's been. We're intercepting customers and channels where we think we can make a difference and where we can add them profitably. You can look at the macro numbers and you'll notice one of the things that's occurring is we're growing a little bit faster in the business segment on wireless than we are in the consumer segment. And part of why we grow better in business is because we're doing better in some of the government, public safety, you know, first responder structures, and that's a help of what's occurring there. And as we get with our large enterprise relationships, do the right thing in that space that can help us grow a little bit quicker. But our intercept channels around how we've been picking up customers in the consumer space are -- they've been strong. They've gotten a little bit stronger. We've been able to demonstrate that we can work with them on a quarter-to-quarter basis and do some things to tweak how we're going to market and make them more successful. And I think you're going to see that if you went and dissected that, we got a little bit from a lot of different places. We didn't just get it from one. And I'm particularly pleased that we're really not just driving this, as I've said before, from very aggressive low-ball national offers with low-price entry points to be able to pick up those customers. When you look at our growth of converged services, you should conclude that we're getting incrementally better quarter-over-quarter around marketing to our consolidated basis of either wireless, no broadband, or broadband, no wireless. So as all those things come together, that's why we did a bit better and we'll continue to take that where we can as long as we can take it profitably. Where we are on kind of costs? Look, I just point to the fact that we're continuing to get margin accretion in our business and you're seeing it. And you're getting margin accretion that outstrips the service revenue growth because we're managing the cost structure more effectively. And I don't go to sleep at night worrying about not having more opportunities to run the business more effectively. I think we have opportunities as we reposition this business to be a 5G and fiber provider. There's a lot of infrastructure and a lot of overheads that have been built up to make this business what it was over a century. And on a base of technology that was great when it was available and it served its time, but it's not going to be the technology that takes us forward into the next decade. And so we're getting better every year at mining out those costs. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. It's a state-by-state battle, but we're making progress on the regulatory front and getting the flexibility to change those cost structures. I think this management team has done an exceptional job of retooling our labor structure around these things and I feel really good about what we've been able to do. And I think we're positioning this Company for an opportunity for growth and a sustainable franchise moving forward that will give people an opportunity for great careers advancing that I feel really good about. It's hard work. We still got a ways to go, but we're getting there. And technology is working in our favor right now. When I said earlier that we put a lot of fiber out there, I've mentioned it to you, we are seeing the benefits in our operating costs as a result of that. And I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but as I said, I wish I was early in my career right now operating in our network organization because what we see in failure rates, in reliability, and on-time performance and what we're able to do to avoid missed appointments because the network just works the right way, and we're not dealing with unexpected things, makes for an operating environment that is far more cost-effective than it's ever been. And we're getting help with technology on the software side. And that software is allowing us to do more that's taking labor out of our labor-intensive processes that allow us to serve customers better and have them walk away feeling better about their experience with AT&T. So we're making good progress. We're going to continue to do that. And I would tell you, I think we can continue to take cost out of this business, continue to improve our consumer margins, continue to hold what I think are some of the best competitive margins in the wireless industry, and grow the business. Brett Feldman : All right, operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Kraft : Thanks. Good morning. I have a question just on the industry. Investors are growing concerned over the potential for a volume slowdown in the wireless industry, and also that perhaps the industry has taken as much pricing power as it can for a while, leaving minimal room for further pricing actions. I just want to ask, what are you seeing in the market as it relates to these issues? Do you share any of these concerns on either volumes or pricing power? Thank you. John Stankey : Yes. I don't mean to sound like a broken record again, Bryan, but I'm going to. I think we've been talking about the fact that we saw volumes moderating in the market for a period of time. And I think what we're seeing this year, even though we're a little bit ahead of the first half of last year, I still expect we're going to see a little bit moderating volumes in aggregate in the industry, and that's been all part and parcel to our guidance and our expectations moving forward with you. I would go back to the fact I think what makes our circumstances unique is, yes, we have part of our business that's focused on the fact that you want the industry to continue to grow and it's doing that. It's doing that because people need to use more of your product. They'll pay you more for better performance and more features and we're certainly seeing that. But we also have a share-take opportunity and that share-take opportunity allows us to create our own growth by ultimately winning customers from others and that's part of our formula that's been effective moving forward. And boy, if we get the formula figured out in the mid-part of the business market, which we continue to work really hard on and haven't gotten quite where I'd like to get, I think that could be another great opportunity for us to show incremental improvement in our performance. Look, what I would also tell you is, do I think that ultimately, we're going to see a situation where the quality of growth is examined more carefully, yes, I do. And I feel really good about what we've done around that. I think the quality of growth that we're bringing forward in this quarter, you can tie a direct relationship to customers that are coming on the payroll to ultimately EBITDA growth in this business. And they're all paying, they're all doing the right thing, and I'll take that quality of growth going forward. I don't worry about the circumstances. I don't get nervous about it because we've been doing that for many, many quarters. It's not an adjustment to our plan. We're going to continue to go find those quality customers with a competitive offering and bring them in, and that will ultimately sustain the business going forward. And I don't think this is an issue of price increases -- for price increases sake. We've been able to demonstrate more value to a customer. We've been able to give them more things. We've been able to do more for them on their accounts. We have continued room to be able to do that to differentiate the product and service. And when we deliver that value, ultimately, command some improvement in ARPUs moving forward. With that, Brett, I'm going to thank everybody for their time this morning. Appreciate it. I -- as I said in my opening remarks, it feels like we're in a little bit of a repeat and rinse and repeat cycle here. That's a good thing. We've been pretty consistent in our approach. I don't have a lot of new things to tell you about how we've been executing around things other than we're doing what we did the previous quarter. And I don't mean to belabor it, but I think at the end of the day, that was clearly one of the objectives of this management team, which was to get to something that allows us week in and week out, month in and month out, quarter in and quarter out to try to manage the same set of issues and get incrementally better. And I think you're seeing that happen in this Company right now and that focus is helpful for us over time and I think we still have more miles to run and actually improve in that play. John Stankey : So thank you for your time and thank you for your interest in AT&T, and I hope everybody enjoys the balance of their summer. Brett Feldman : All right. Operator, you can close out the call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's panel, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today's teleconference call, and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Brett Feldman, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter call. I'm Brett Feldman, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings, results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thank you, Brett. I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you're all doing well today. The third quarter showed again that our team continues to produce solid results as we efficiently grow high value wireless and broadband subscribers. Since Pascal will go through the quarter in detail, I'll share more on how our investment led strategy is helping us deliver on our full year consolidated financial guidance, creating runway for future growth, and then I'll provide a few updates on some recent developments. Our strategy remains the same to lead the industry in converged connectivity through 5G and fiber. In Mobility, the value of the coverage and reliability of the service we provide and our best deals for every one approach that puts our customers first are producing solid, sustainable results. We're growing 5G subscribers in a durable way and delivered 403,000 postpaid phone net adds in the third quarter. We also grew efficiently with lower year-over-year postpaid phone churn and upgrade rates. Three quarters of the way through the year, our Mobility business has grown EBITDA by more than 6%, which is in the high end of the guidance we provided for the full year. This puts us in a solid position heading into the fourth quarter where we expect seasonally higher phone purchasing activity, upgrades and promotional cycles. Overall, we feel great about our continued momentum in Mobility. We're adding customers, increasing profitability and expect to deliver the best postpaid phone churn in the industry for the 13th time in 15 quarters. Now let's switch gears to Consumer Wireline where we generated positive total broadband subscriber net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter despite impacts from a one month work stoppage in the Southeast and from Hurricane Helene. And I think it's important to take a moment, recognize our frontline teams who continue to show up in a heroic fashion while confronting multiple devastating hurricanes. We were pleased to welcome our committed employees in the Southeast back to work on September 16th, with newly ratified agreements, a five year contract in the Southeast and a similar four year agreement in the West, we appropriately recognize our employees for the exceptional service and performance they provide our customers on a daily basis with annual wage increases averaging 3.6%. Our employees will maintain their position as some of the best paid professionals in the industry, while we cooperatively work with our labor partners to reposition the company around 5G and fiber is the only all union wireless and broadband provider in the U.S. We serve millions of individuals and businesses in the Southeast region of the country and our frontline employees on the ground have responded quickly and worked tirelessly to keep our communities, customers and first responders connected when it matters most. For context, our FirstNet organization provides a meaningfully differentiated product to public safety during events like these. Our organization dedicated to supporting our growing public safety base on FirstNet responded to more than 200 requests during the Hurricane Helene recovery. This was one of our largest emergency response efforts ever. These efforts are nothing short of remarkable. It's exactly why more than 29,000 public safety agencies and organizations, including the New York City Police Department, the Fire Department of New York City and the North Carolina Department of Public Safety choose FirstNet. The only dedicated communications platform for public safety. We applaud the FCC's recent decision to make available 50 megahertz of spectrum to the FirstNet authority to facilitate nationwide deployment of 5G services for first responders, and we look forward to working together on plans that take these capabilities to the next level. Moving back to broadband. Despite a 30 day work stoppage in the Southeast portion of our footprint, we've now had more than 200,000 AT&T Fiber net adds for 19 consecutive quarters, which shows the strong underlying customer demand for fiber. In the quarter, Consumer Wireline delivered more than 8% EBITDA growth, driven by nearly 17% growth in fiber revenues. These consistent results make it clear that our fiber investment is generating attractive returns with improved operating leverage as we transition from legacy networks. Overall, the underlying momentum with 5G and fiber positions us to close the year strong. While our 5G and fiber businesses are performing well on their own, it's increasingly clear that customers prefer to purchase mobility and broadband together as a converged service. Only AT&T can offer this at scale with benefits from owners' economics. This is driving a reinforcing cycle where the success of our fiber business drives growth in mobility and vice versa. As we shared last quarter, about four out of every 10 AT&T fiber households also choose AT&T is their wireless provider. Additionally, our share of postpaid phone subscribers within the AT&T fiber footprint is about 500 basis points higher than our national average. This highlights the true benefit of owning and operating both 5G and fiber networks at scale, which is the ability to drive higher share in both mobility and broadband through converged service penetration. Over time, we expect this should drive higher returns on our invested capital in both our mobility and broadband businesses than either could achieve as a standalone operation. While our convergence strategy began with a focus on our own fiber footprint, we're also pursuing attractive opportunities to expand AT&T fiber outside of it. We're already America's largest fiber provider with the fastest and most reliable speeds. The superiority of AT&T fiber elevates the overall AT&T brand, we want more customers to experience the best wired Internet experience available today, that's why we've announced plans to bring AT&T Fiber high speed Internet to even more people in new geographies through Gigapower, our joint venture with BlackRock, as well as through recent agreements with commercial open access fiber providers. These fiber driven growth initiatives present attractive capital efficient ways for us to provide both AT&T fiber and 5G wireless services to more customers. In addition to being the largest capital investor in the U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019 we continue to reduce our net debt and increase operating leverage due to a combination of higher EBITDA and strong free cash flow generation. Our financial flexibility continues to improve, and we remain on pace to meet our target of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5 times range in the first half of next year. In the quarter, we also announced that we reached an agreement to sell our remaining 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG in a non-contingent transaction, subject only to customary closing conditions, and separate from the regulatory process associated with the DIRECTV DISH transaction. This sale and transaction structure allows us to continue our focus on being a leader in 5G and fiber connectivity throughout America, while further strengthening the balance sheet. It also presents new optionality as we consider opportunities to leverage our significant distribution to aggregate products and services that simplify and improve our customers' lives. We will close the transaction following necessary regulatory approvals and optimal financing and tax considerations. We're confident that the company's transformation over the past four years has positioned us well for continued organic growth, while also increasing our financial flexibility and capacity to support sustained investment and enhance shareholder returns. We're excited to share the details of what this all means for the future of AT&T, when we speak with you again at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day on December 3rd, so mark your calendars for an exciting visit to Big D. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal to cover the quarter in greater detail. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing our third quarter financial summary on Slide 8. Third quarter consolidated results were in line with our expectations. Revenues were down slightly as a decline in Business Wireline service revenues and low margin mobility equipment revenues were mostly offset by growth in higher margin wireless service revenues and fiber revenues. Year-over-year consolidated revenue trends were also impacted by more than $100 million of FX headwinds and an approximately $100 million impact from transferring our cybersecurity business into a joint venture earlier this year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3.4% for the quarter as growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline and Mexico, which collectively drove more than 80% of our total revenues in the quarter were partially offset by a continued decline in Business Wireline. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA grew 3.4%, and we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range for the full year. We expect to achieve this growth even with about $115 million of estimated financial impact related to the effects of Hurricane Helene and Milton and the work stoppage. Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline are expected to bear most of this impact. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 compared to $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. Consistent with prior quarters this year, the third quarter included about $0.09 of aggregate EPS headwinds from the four items we discussed earlier in the year. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.61 impact related to a $4.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge for our Business Wireline unit driven by an industry-wide secular decline of legacy services. For the full year, our expectations remain for adjusted EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $12.8 billion. This is up $2.4 billion compared to the same time last year and consistent with our goal of driving higher free cash flow that is more ratable on a quarterly basis. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $5.1 billion, which included the previously disclosed one-time payment of $480 million related to our wireless network transformation and the continued paydown of vendor financing obligations. Capital investment for the quarter was $5.5 billion, down about $150 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower vendor financing payments. Capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, up approximately $650 million compared to the prior year. We expect higher capital investment in the fourth quarter as we ramp our wireless network modernization. We also expect to sustain strong cash conversion in the fourth quarter and anticipate using our improved liquidity to continue reducing our short-term financing, including further paydown of vendor financing in the fourth quarter. These additional vendor financing payments put us on page for a full year capital investment at the high end of our guidance range of $21 billion to $22 billion. Our free cash flow is tracking to the midpoint of our guidance range of $17 billion to $18 billion. Now let's look at our mobility operating results on Slide 9. For the quarter, we delivered 403,000 postpaid phone net adds down from 468,000 a year ago. This is consistent with our wireless market normalization expectation. We also posted another quarter of year-over-year churn improvement with postpaid phone churn of 0.8% versus 0.79% in the third quarter of 2023. Mobility service revenue grew 4% driven by strong execution in our balanced go-to-market strategy. In the quarter, we also aligned the timing of certain administrative fees and recorded approximately $90 million of one-time revenues that benefited service revenue. Postpaid phone ARPU was $57.7, up 1.9% year-over-year largely driven by higher ARPU on legacy plans. As expected, service revenue growth was partially offset by lower equipment revenues with a postpaid upgrade rate of 3.5%, which was down from 3.9% last year. In prepaid, our Cricket brand continues to display remarkable consistency with positive phone net adds for 40 consecutive quarters or a decade straight. For the year, we continue to expect Mobility service revenue growth in the 3% range. Mobility EBITDA of $9.5 billion grew 6.7% or by about $600 million year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, Mobility EBITDA grew 6.3%, reflecting nearly 100% of service revenue growth flowing through to EBITDA. The strong performance puts us on pace to achieve our target of mobility EBITDA growth in the higher end of the mid-single digit range for the full year. Our Mobility outlook also continues to anticipate higher fourth quarter promotional activity levels consistent with seasonal trends. Now let's move to Consumer Wireline results on Slide 10. The sustainable strength of fiber is driving Consumer Wireline growth and yielding strong returns. In the quarter, we added 28,000 total broadband subscribers, which includes 226,000 AT&T fiber net adds. Our fiber subscriber gains also reflect an estimated 50,000 fewer net adds from the work stoppage and storms in the Southeast. It is clear that where we do have AT&T Fiber, we win. We now passed more than 28 million consumer and business locations with fiber and remain on track to pass 30 million plus fiber locations by the end of 2025. As we've stated before, the better-than-expected returns we're seeing on our fiber investment, potentially expand our opportunity to go beyond our initial build target by roughly 10 million to 15 million additional locations. We look forward to providing you with a more detailed update on our plans for expanding the reach of AT&T Fiber during our Analyst and Investor Day on December 3. Outside of fiber, we remain encouraged by the early performance of AT&T Internet Air and our success proactively migrating legacy copper-based Internet customers to this service. We now have nearly 500,000 total AT&T Internet Air consumer subscribers, including 135,000 added during the quarter. Third quarter broadband revenues grew 6.4% due to strong fiber revenue growth of nearly 17%. For the full year, we continue to expect broadband revenue growth of 7% plus. Fiber ARPU of $70.36 was up 3.2% year-over-year with intake ARPU approximately $75. We continue to see solid uptake in higher speed fiber tiers and a healthy underlying pricing trends. The third quarter also was the first full quarter in which ARPU was impacted by the rollout of Autopay changes. We view Autopay as a long-term benefit for customers as well as operationally for our broadband business. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 8.6%, as growth in broadband revenues and ongoing cost transformation continued to improve profitability. Through the third quarter, Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 10%, and we continue to expect growth in the mid to high-single digit range for the full year, including impacts from the recent work stoppage and storms. Now let's cover Business Wireline on Slide 11. Business Wireline EBITDA was down 20% due to continued industry wide secular declines in legacy voice services. The reported decline in EBITDA also reflects a tough comparison versus the third quarter of last year, which benefited from approximately $100 million of IP sales that did not recur in 3Q this year. Overall, Business Wireline is performing slightly below the outlook we provided in the first quarter due to lower revenue expectations, including a shift of IP sales into 2025, as well as the impact of Southeast work stoppage and impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We now expect Business Wireline EBITDA declines in the high-teens range for the full year versus our prior outlook for a mid-teen decline. While near-term declines in legacy voice revenues are likely to weigh on Business Wireline EBITDA trends for the remainder of the year, our 5G and wireless products continue to present attractive growth opportunities in business solutions. This includes sustained growth at FirstNet, which now has approximately 6.4 million total connections. Similarly, we're excited about the potential of emerging growth products like AT&T Internet AirFit (ph) business. Now let's move to Slide 12 for an update on our capital allocation strategy. Our approach to capital allocation remains consistent and deliberate. We're successfully balancing efficient growth with long-term investment as we deliver converged network services to more customers, pay down debt and return value to shareholders. We also remain focused on deleveraging, we reduced net debt by about $1.1 billion in the quarter despite a $1.3 billion FX headwind related to foreign debt. Also recall we fully hedge our foreign denominated debt. So we have an offsetting FX gain recorded in other non-current liabilities on our balance sheet related to the hedges. Year-over-year, we've reduced net debt by approximately $2.9 billion and have lower vendor and supplier financing by $2.4 billion. At the end of September, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 2.8 times, and we're making steady progress on achieving our target in the 2.5 times range in the first half of 2025. Looking forward, our debt maturities are very manageable and we're in a great position with more than 95% of our long-term debt fixed with a weighted average rate of 4.2%. In addition to paying down debt, we reduced direct supplier and vendor financing obligations by about $1.7 billion versus the second quarter. The third quarter net impact from securitization facilities was a $400 million source of cash. So the net of these items was a $1.3 billion use of cash. In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential increase in direct supplier financing balances due to typical seasonality. However, we expect to continue reducing our aggregate net balance of direct supply and vendor financing on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year, which should lower our interest expense and continue to improve the quality and ratability of our cash flows over time. DIRECTV distributions in the quarter were about $600 million on a pretax basis. Based on the terms of our agreement to divest our 70% stake in DIRECTV, we expect $1.1 billion of pre-tax cash payments in 4Q. Cash taxes were about $600 million in the third quarter, and we expect to pay about $1.6 billion in cash taxes in the fourth quarter. To close, I'm very pleased with our team's performance so far this year. And as John noted, we're on pace to deliver on all of our full year 2024 consolidated financial guidance. Brett, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Brett Feldman : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we are ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Good morning. Thank you very much. John, you mentioned in the fourth quarter, we expect seasonally higher phone purchasing activity upgrades and promo cycles. Can you just put some context around that you've continued to see low upgrade activity. There's concerns about a bigger iPhone cycle. What are you expecting in the fourth quarter and longer term as Apple introduces AI, etc. And then just one on the Business Wireline. Any kind of light at the end of the tunnel there? How much more of the sort of pressures do you think we get before the rate of change starts to stabilize and improve? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Simon. Good morning. Simon Flannery : Good morning. John Stankey : So I don't know that I can give you an answer that's more satisfying than last quarter on projecting what Apple phone sales might be. You've seen the numbers, they're down slightly over last year's levels on an introduction. We're still waiting, obviously, for the software release and whether or not that software release drives interest in the consumer base to accelerate that remains to be seen, I don't know. I've given you my point of view that says, I think some of these things are going to be a little bit more graceful ramp-up in consumer interest as opposed to a big bang. Software oftentimes tends to be that. If you went back and thought about any software innovation that occurs on a handset over the past decades or so, you tend to see that dynamic occur. They become material and meaningful over time. But oftentimes, certain features didn't exactly go to this massive ramp when they're first released because software is an iterative technology sometimes has to be iterated on to improve it and make it meaningful and address the particular need. So I don't know that I would expect when the software release comes out, that all of a sudden, we see this massive uptick, but the consumer will ultimately decide that the consumer will be the one that decides what to do. And I think to my remarks, we're in a position in what we've done through the first-three quarters of this year that we've got a lot of flexibility. We can adjust to whatever takes place. I think I mentioned last quarter when we were on the call, expected that fourth quarter might be active combination of holiday season device capabilities. And so we've tried to make sure that we're in a position to address that, no matter how it occurs, and I feel like based on what you've seen in the industry over the course of the last couple of weeks, things have been very realistic and very pragmatic about how folks have approached the market. And I don't expect things to be dramatically different as we move through the fourth quarter. Relative to Business Wireline, look, there's a lot -- there are green shoots. As you know, we're trying to reposition the business to a connectivity based business. And when I look at what we're doing in our connectivity based product and service portfolio as we reposition the focus of the organization, we move from spending most of our time in the Fortune 1000 to a broader exposure to the business market. I do see those volumes starting to take off, and I see our distribution starting to ramp. They're just not doing at the rate and pace of some of the decline in the legacy revenue base and some of those are products are fairly mature products that have very attractive margin constructs around it, and there's a little bit of a shift going on. And it's not a whole lot different than what we were kind of going through on the consumer side a few years back. We will catch it exactly the date that we will catch it. We'll spend some time on that in December, giving you a little bit of an outlook of how we see that playing through. But as you've been seeing, we've been doing a nice job as a business, finding other places to grow to kind of offset that as we move through it. I drive home at night thinking about a lot of things. We have a tough challenge in front of us on or things that I wonder whether we're headed in the right direction. One thing I do not wonder about is whether we should be putting our time and effort in repositioning the business. I feel very, very comfortable that this is a place that AT&T should be, this is an important market to us, all of our data, all of our research, everything we're doing suggests that we can create long-term value, just like we're doing in Consumer, as a converged provider and we will be successful in that transition. And I don't want to lose the fact that because we report Business Wireline separately, it doesn't really reflect how we're doing in the business market overall. When you add in what we're experiencing in the wireless space and the solid growth that we're putting up on the board, a lot of that's coming from business. And it's just -- it's a technology shift in some cases, a business that have traditionally purchase wireline services that are now migrating certain products and services to wireless. And I think our product portfolio is now starting to evolve where on a combined basis, we can be even more effective. And I'm pretty confident, we\u2019re going to make that pivot, and we\u2019re going to be in a good place after we get everything lined up on that. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks, John. Brett Feldman : We'll take our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks and good morning, guys. I don't want to jump in too much on the December event, but can we talk a little bit about the out-of-region opportunity with fiber. I guess, first, how did you guys or what was the criteria for selecting the partners that you have? And are there more partners likely to be added? Second, how big could that opportunity be? I guess, including Gigapower. And third, are you guys seeing the churn benefits, I guess, you sort of laid out the customers that have bundled service, but are you guys seeing churn benefits in the wireless business for customers that -- have that take both services? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, John. So happy to talk about some of those. And of course, to your point, we'll spend even more time and give you a little bit more texture when you come and visit us here in December. I hope you do come. So look, the partner dynamic is -- it's a good question, and it's really important in our point of view. And I think I alluded to this at the Communacopia conference. We tried to put a portfolio of capabilities together that make us the attractive partner. And it's not just that we can go in and move product for somebody. We're doing all the things where -- because we have a Gigapower offer and because we're actually, in some cases, operating what could ultimately be an open access network in some parts of the country. We've been very mindful of how you should construct the product offer or how you need to work with partners, etc., and we walked in with a model that's a model that we're executing in our own partner footprint where we can walk in and offer them even though we're not funding the build in this case, the same construct of what we're executing in Gigapower, same product offer, the same ability to bring our distribution strength that comes in play. The same ability to do things like offer OSS and BSS back offices that can facilitate people and how they operate things even going as far as what we can do to give them opportunities to ride on our scale and our capabilities with third-party suppliers and providers as they go about the work that they're doing, and we're very open, for example, of offering the technologies we put together for in-home technologies, how that product capability evolves over time. And to build a world-class product, that kind of scale is essential. So when we walk in and we approach a partner, and when we approach a partner, and we're not necessarily interested in selling fixed wireless access over the top of them, that looks like a really good place for somebody to maybe invest in a relationship over time, that's mutually productive moving forward. And is there more out there that can be done? Sure. And I think one of the things that maybe we all need to understand structurally of what's occurring in this industry over time is, these partnerships and some of the open access arrangements will, in fact, change the percentage of the population that certain brands and converged capabilities can serve over time. And I think that will be a meaningful -- not these most significant part, but it will be a meaningful part of the total addressable market that companies like AT&T can ultimately attack moving forward. So I do think it can get bigger. I think you're seeing just the front end of it right now. As I've said before, I don't believe this is a two or three year dynamic. I think this is what will the industry structure emerge to over the next decade dynamic. And that's the play that I'm kind of focusing the business on, and I'm trying to think about as we allocate capital to ensure that over the next decade, AT&T is positioned in the right way as this industry restructures in a very different way than what we've seen in the previous decade. So where we are in performance, I gave a fair amount of insight to the front end of what we're seeing with some of our partnership sales when I was out at Communacopia. I think what we can safely say is everything at the front end, customer acquisition, ARPUs, our rate of penetration, all those things, as I shared, are looking very, very similar to what's happening in region. That's how I would kind of sum it up. I think I also shared with you when we went and we established those partnerships, we didn't expect that. We de-rated our business cases. We expected we'd be somewhat slower to penetration given that the brand hadn't necessarily been in those markets. We expected that maybe we would have ARPU dynamics that we have to price differently in order to penetrate blah, blah, blah, that's not happening. It's looking more like the in-region business case and that only makes it more compelling. Now what we don't know yet John is, we haven't been in that business for two years or 18 months. So I can't conclusively tell you that we're going to see the same dynamic play into our wireless share perspective and our churn dynamic. But if I'm seeing the early stuff looking like what it does in region, I guess I'd step back and say, why should the back end look a lot different over time, assuming we offer the same quality product and the same execution, what we\u2019re achieving on our more established footprint and all the operational dynamics would be that we are, in fact, executing in that way. John Hodulik : Yeah. That make sense. Thanks for the color. Brett Feldman : We will take the next question please. Operator : That will come from the line of Peter Supino with Wolf Research. Peter Supino : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. A question on consumer broadband and one on capital allocation. In Consumer broadband, your Internet Air net add growth stabilized despite your announcement that you've launched about 204 partial regions last quarter. And so, I wonder if you could comment on the relationship between that open for sale change and the growth path of Internet Air, just bigger picture? And then on capital allocation, on the M&A front, I wonder if you have a point of view on HFC assets on cable assets, where they could possibly be complementary to your fiber strategy depending on the region and the assets you have in place? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Peter. I'm very comfortable with where we're at on Internet Air. I don't think you should be, as I've said many, many, many times, you shouldn't expect that AT&T is going to look like some of our competitors in the industry on volume and where we're going. We're using it, as I've said before, very strategically. I'll sell to any business customer that is well suited to the product, that's an attractive market to us. It's an attractive market because of what we can bring in growth in other products and services, including handsets in the account, we can justify the usage characteristics around it. You should expect as we continue to scale some of our distribution in the mid-business market that you'll see those numbers grow as a result of that, and then use it very strategically in consumer. We're using it as a footprint hold capability as we know we've got some copper customers, we can improve service levels, waiting for fiber. In some cases, we're using it to migrate people off of copper so that we can ultimately turn down costly service areas and not have to support the legacy infrastructure that's in place and occasionally in markets where we have surplus spectrum that we know will be in place for many, many years. And it's really kind of a follow dynamic, and we can get the right kind of returns on it. But that rate and pace is never going to rival what you're seeing with anybody else, and you should just assume that's the case. I would tell you, relative to our internal projections of the product, we're very much in line with what our expectations would have been. And I don't think you're going to see what I would call a demonstrative shift in the quarters moving forward. There was a time in my career where I thought I was \u2013 I at Air, at that time where I believe the pivot to HFC was the right capital allocation decision. And I think cable has demonstrated that it has been a pretty resilient and capable infrastructure that they've managed to get very attractive returns on. But every decision has its time in place. And my belief is, even if you kind of look at the dynamics of what's necessary to service DOCSIS 4, we're on this steady march that eventually fiber is moving its way to a customer. We've been on that March since the early 1980s when fiber introduced itself, and it's just been on a slow March to getting closer to the customer. And I think we're now starting to get into the final innings of that game. And so in what I would consider to be a more mature technology cycle of HFC jumping into something that ultimately ends with fiber having to show up at the customer's home doesn't seem like a timed -- well-timed decision at this juncture. More importantly, I look at our business model and our organic opportunities that are in front of us, and I look at how we're executing around this and I look at the future returns that are available, and I'm more interested in allocating capital to use the business model we have that I think is incredibly powerful and has a fantastic runway, a fantastic annuity stream, a durable annuity stream for investors. And so that's where my energy is at, which is simplifying operations, having continuity, working with partners that can expand our footprint. I think that's the play that has longevity. And I don't subscribe to this point of view that over the long haul, that the next wave of growth in this space is somehow sub-optimal return characteristics. I just don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t see that. I don\u2019t see that in any of the operations of our business. And I don\u2019t see it in the way the market is structured. Peter Supino : Thanks, John. Brett Feldman : Thanks, Peter. We will take the next question, please. Operator : And that will come from the line of David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So John, I do remember when you had Air, so you look great. So John, I wanted to ask this question, which is maybe the inverse of the Gigapower question, which is, as you think about how you're building fiber out in your territory and as you make these new decisions about what's coming next, is the fiber build in your territory walled garden that's only for AT&T's benefit and however much share you're able to get is the share you get or is there a thought that maybe AT&T wants to be an open access provider and the parts of the market that it doesn't access directly, you can at least participate in on a wholesale basis the way you historically were talking about maybe the wireless business and the cable relationship? And then the second question, if I could, Pascal, I think you were reiterating the guidance, the -- I think I missed the line that said that 2025 earnings growth would be positive. Obviously, there's lots of moving parts, but could you just step us through kind of the thought process on taking that out. Thank you. John Stankey : Hi, Dave. That must be when you getting old, if you remember when I had Air, but\u2026 David Barden : I\u2019m. John Stankey : The -- but you look good for being old days. David Barden : Right back at you, John. John Stankey : Yeah. Look, as I said, I think the structure of this industry is going to evolve differently over the next decade. And the way I think about it is, there's going to be far more differentiation that comes in overtime on what a converged offering looks like, and that differentiation will be both on product and service. And I think, if you're -- I don't want to use the term walled garden, but if you think about owned and operated assets, our motivation would be to get the best customers that we can sell the most product to and provide the most vertical revenue capability on new products and services where our brand is the owned and operated servicing brand to that customer. And I think that's the play that we want to be putting our time and energy on for the next year or two. And I think we're going to be very successful in that regard, and we're going to find very attractive customers that are interested in a very simple value proposition of working with one company, and we're going to make sure that we get the most share that we possibly can in the market in that way, shape or form that will probably be the most profitable loyal and best customers we have. But I've been in this industry long enough to know that it is a high fixed cost industry, and there's been an element of wholesale that has played in overtime in virtually every piece of infrastructure that's been built. And will come a time where you step back and say there's another point or two of growth or capacity that can be allocated in a way that's different than the way it is today, and it could be done on a wholesale structure and it may be accretive to the overall returns of the business, I think it's entirely possible that, that day could arrive. And I think it's really important that we think about an industry structure in that regard because as people start talking about the ability to federate product and service across an industry and what footprint looks like over the course of the next decade. If you're not thinking about the likelihood that, that could become an element of how the industry is structured. You're missing the fact that the dynamic of how cable, for example, has federated on nationwide constructs of cooperation that you could have a much broader footprint of how you think about marketing and selling your products and services that have unique capabilities and your brand position in a way over time that can make a very strong difference in terms of profitability and return. So I won't rule it out. I absolutely believe that over time, there may be an accretive and economic construct around it. I don't know that time is right now, but it's something that we should be paying attention to when you have plenty of capacity in the ground that you can continue to sell in different ways. And Pascal, if you want to talk about the earnings dynamic for '25. Pascal Desroches : Sure. Thanks. Hey, Dave. Thank you. I wouldn't read too much into it except for the fact that, look, as you know, we announced our DIRECTV transaction. And we're not quite sure when in 2025, that's going to close. So depending upon when it closes, we may not grow EPS on a reported basis, but rest assured, on an organic basis, there is nothing to see here that we continue to expect our EBITDA and operating income to grow next year. So I feel really good about the overall performance and so it's really all about DIRECTV and the timing close. David Barden : All right. Thank you, both. Brett Feldman : We will take the next question, please. Operator : That will come from the line of Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Curious, if you could provide an update on the wireless competitive landscape broadly across the consumer and business verticals. And if you can unpack in a little bit more detail what's driving the growth in postpaid phone ARPU on a year-over-year basis, and how you view the sustainability of postpaid phone ARPU growth over the next couple of years? John Stankey : Hi, Michael. Look, I think the industry is great. I'm very comfortable with where things sit. It's competitive. We're having to work really hard, but I don't look at it and say, I can't figure it out. I can't rationalize what people are doing. I mean I look at all the moves that competitors are making and what's going on. And the -- I think I can understand them. I think I understand what their trying to achieve. I understand what we have in terms of our long-term ability to compete against it in an effective fashion. I don't mean to sound like a broken record. There's some growth that's going on in the industry that I'm not as interested in participating in as others might be. And I've tried to be disciplined about that. I feel good about kind of the balance of our growth to the quality of our growth. And I think over the long haul, that's the best way to ensure that we're returning for our shareholders, and I feel good about where we stand in that regard. And I don't expect that is going to change dramatically, and I see consumers using more of our product every month. I see it working their ways into their lives in even more important fashions. And I think that bodes well over the long haul for what's occurring. Business, as I mentioned earlier is a place that I think we could do better as our distribution gets fine-tuned a bit. That\u2019s -- there's a lot of activity going on in the business market. I believe that we're not -- we're doing well, but we're not as good as we can be. I think there's still some segments in the business market that we can be more present and more effective, especially, given what we're able to do on a combined basis, the introduction of Internet Air in addition to selling voice products as well as our fiber footprint. And I don't know that that's any different in how the market is performing. It's just an opportunity of where I think we can get incrementally better as we move through the year. As I think about ARPU, it's always a combination of things. I actually would say, as I move into next year, I wouldn't dismiss, if I was able to be a little bit more effective in the value segment of the market and that came at a plateauing of ARPU because I was getting a little bit better growth in that segment because of the mix that was occurring that wouldn't bother me, frankly. But I would say on the embedded base of customers we have, our ARPU growth is because we're able to get customers to say, they want to buy up and get more from us and buy other products and services that add value to that relationship, whether it would be insurance or what they're needing to do to upgrade plans in order to get higher performance off the wireless network and more features and services that we bring in on the higher rated plans. We'll continue to do that. We still have room to grow on that. We certainly have been very diligent as we have been in the last couple of years to look for pockets in our base of where we think there is a value mismatch, and we can possibly realign some pricing into the market, that's helped us this year. It helped us last year, I would expect it might help us a little bit next year. So I feel like we can continue to do the right things and managing the returns and yields of our customers. But I would actually like to see us maybe do a little bit better down at the low end of the market overall. And that would naturally come at a little bit of a play on ARPU from a company that has leading ARPU in the industry. Brett Feldman : We\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If we consider the pace of your fiber net additions and broadband heading into next year, if you're passing the same or more locations with better penetration, is there any reason to believe why those fiber net additions shouldn't accelerate next year? And then relative to CapEx, I believe we heard from one of your competitors yesterday that CapEx is moving higher in 2025, mainly due to accelerated fiber investment. And then, obviously, this is an area where you've been the most vocal in your industry in terms of fiber expansion, is expect you would see the same trend in your CapEx next year? John Stankey : Hi, Jim. I guess I would say our rate and pace of build has been more level loaded over the last several years and as we introduce new footprint, it's been very ratable in kind of what we bring in. There's still seasonality that occurs in our net add dynamics that are more market based around buying cycles of the consumer. I wouldn't expect it to dramatically change as you move into next year. I don't see anything where there's a footprint that's going to come in that will dramatically change that dynamic because we've been at a pretty steady pace of new footprint as how we brought it in. So I don't think you should see any dramatic change in the rate and pace of what we've been able to do and how we're doing it. And I can't speak to my competitors. I can tell you, I'm well aware that we've been investing at the top of the industry over the last four years and that's been necessary for us to reposition the company to where we are today and see some of the opportunities that are in front of us, and I feel very comfortable that, that investment has driven the right kind of growth. But we've been on that trajectory. We've already been doing the things that, I think I'm seeing other people starting to maybe look at and consider investing capital into. So it's not like I've got to start investing in fiber. I've been doing it for over four years now, and we've had great success at it. We have a great footprint. We're the leading provider of fiber in the market. And I think a lot of that\u2019s in our run rate. And as we\u2019re getting better and better and driving costs down, there\u2019s things that we can do to start to moderate our capital intensity as we get some of these things behind us over time, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that as we move into our Investor Day and how we see that playing out over the next couple of years. James Schneider : Thank you. Brett Feldman : We will take next question, please. Operator : That will come from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Sebastiano Petti : Housekeeping question. I think last quarter, you pointed out that the postpaid phone ARPU should probably, you see more of an impact or more of a benefit in the fourth quarter than third quarter related to the price increase that kind of went into effect mid-3Q. Is that still the right way to kind of think about it? And relatedly, of the $90 million one-time benefit, is that within postpaid phone ARPU or is that perhaps captured somewhere else within service revenue? And then maybe, I guess, broader kind of question. I mean, John, you did talk about the 4.9 gigahertz award to FirstNet for AT&T. Obviously, I think in -- at Communacopia, did kind of talk about the supply of spectrum likely influencing pricing across the industry over the next several years, an election upcoming in a few weeks here, probably not going to materially change the availability of spectrum for a few years. So just thinking about AT&T's appetite, given your peer kind of did some transaction in the secondary market just last week? Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Hey, Sebastiano. How are you. So in terms of our -- the pricing actions that we announced, those will impact the fourth quarter, but it's all baked into the guidance that we provided to you -- the updated guidance we provided you. So we feel really good about the overall trajectory of the business. And the $90 million adjustment related to our simplification of our building of administrative fees really is -- it is impacting postpaid ARPU. John Stankey : So my comment on kind of where we are. I think about spectrum and the portfolio spectrum of the 4.9 not much differently than any other spectrum that needs to be developed. It takes time. If the FirstNet authority decides they want to deploy that in a way that is similar to how they've deployed Spectrum previously. It will certainly take time to have infrastructure put in place and to figure out where they wish to do that and how they want to deploy it. So I don't think this is anything where you've got the same dynamic that you might have in the secondary spectrum market right now where you can acquire something, flip a switch and ultimately get capacity into your network and an opportunity to continue to grow on things. And for that very reason, of course, I'd be interested in the secondary market, and it's something that we pay attention to and if I can go in and pick up attractive spectrum that is harmonized with our existing holdings that we can go and get additional capacity without putting more capital into the network to do things that's a good move for our shareholders. It's a good move for our customers. It's a good way to sustain growth and where there's opportunistic opportunities to do that, I always pay attention to those things. I'll never -- not examine those and understand whether or not there's an opportunity to do that. And I think what's important to understand and is, we'll certainly talk about in December, we've worked really hard over the last four years. I think the team has done a remarkable job of improving the qualities of our cash flow. What our capital position is? Pascal talked about it in his comments, about where we are on the balance sheet. And we have latitude and flexibility to do those kinds of things, and do them strategically and carefully. And so to the extent that they present themselves, I do that. And similarly, as we work with the FirstNet authority there's win-wins in a lot of these things. And just like there was a win-win in how we introduced their initial holdings spectrum and allowed them to get some of the product and service capability that is truly differentiated using our embedded portfolio spectrum and services that are in place, while we ultimately deployed the dedicated bands to them. I see the same opportunity presenting itself as we work through 4.9, where we can continue to give them advanced 5G services as we\u2019re harmonizing that spectrum and putting it out in the network and allowing the next generation of unique and differentiated public safety services for FirstNet to be developed that we can both benefit from that if they choose to do that is the band manager for that spectrum. Brett Feldman : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Maybe a couple on '25. I know it's a little early for you guys to start talking about it. But maybe if we could just understand the levers, I mean, operating leverage this year has been very high, especially on the mobility side because of upgrade rate and also churn being low, of course. So if you could just talk through maybe some of the levers next year, maybe on the cost front or maybe the price versus value dynamic? That would be helpful. And the same question on cash flow, just in terms of leverage, you -- obviously, taxes will be a headwind. But when the financing in theory should be an easier comp and directly we, of course, would be depending on when the deal closes, that would be another variable. So if you could just help us think through the operating leverage side and the cash flow that would be helpful. Thank you. Pascal Desroches : Sure thing. I'll start, and John will probably chime in. Here's the way I think about it, we've been investing because we expect to continue to grow our business over time. So you should expect a continuation of our EBITDA growth over time. And we will -- our Mobility business, we're really pleased with how we've been performing. And I believe that it's one that we can sustain that. Similarly, we're really pleased with our Consumer broadband business, and we continue to believe that there is opportunity to drive more operating levers there as we continue to scale fiber, what you should see is over time, profit margins that are much closer to some of our scale broadband competitors. And I would -- we still have an opportunity across the board to continue to work on cost, whether it is costs associated with serving our customers through the use of AI, machine learning, there are plenty of opportunities there as well as we have opportunities to continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. And over time, the other benefit to think about the 2025 is the fact that, the last 2023 and 2024 will be a year that we have spent paying down vendor financing balances fairly significantly. And as we exit this year, I would expect us to be at a level that we will manage the company at overtime. So while those investments have depressed free cash flow over the last two years. We're going to be in a position where they are not going to depress free cash flow. Going the other way, we would expect higher cash taxes and the absence of DIRECTV to help offset some of those tailwinds. But by and large, we are investing because we believe long term, this is a business that we can grow both top line and bottom line. Brett Feldman : All right. That is the end of the call. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us this morning. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Brett Feldman, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Brett Feldman, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings, results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? John Stankey : Thanks, Brett. I appreciate you joining us. I hope you'll find there aren't going to be any surprises on today's call. We finished 2024 strong, like we said, we would at our Analyst and Investor Day in December. We achieved full year results that are in-line or better than all the consolidated financial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Before I cover our accomplishments, I'd like to extend my heartfelt sympathies to everyone in Southern California. Our thoughts and prayers with all those people whose lives, homes and families have been deeply impacted by the most destructive wildfires in modern U.S. history. In these moments, the importance of connection becomes increasingly apparent. And I'd like to thank our teams for their commitment to keeping customers, communities, and first responders connected in the face of this historic devastation. Now turning to our 2024 performance. Our team delivered another solid year as they again drove durable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. In Mobility, our consistent go-to-market strategy continues to resonate as more customers are choosing and staying with AT&T. Last year, we had about 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions with service revenue growth of 3.5%. We also expect to lead the industry in postpaid phone churn for the 14th time in the last 16 quarters and to lead the industry on an annual basis for the fourth straight year. This is an impressive winning run in wireless. And as you've heard me say before, where we have fiber, we won as well. We've now added 1 million or more AT&T Fiber subscribers for a remarkable seven straight years. It's clear that fiber is the best broadband alternative technology available and this was validated by Ookla just last week, when they named AT&T Fiber America's fastest Internet with the most reliable speeds. Following another strong quarter for both AT&T Fiber and AT&T Internet Air, we've now achieved six consecutive quarters of positive broadband net adds. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner by adding valuable subscribers, while simultaneously simplifying experiences and processes for our customers and employees. You see the results of these efforts and the margin expansion and free cash flow growth we delivered in 2024 as we outlined at our Analyst and Investors Day. We expect these trends will continue. Our investment in 5G and fiber is fueling this sustained growth. This is why we're so focused on building a durable franchise for the long-term. Our deliberate and balanced approach to capital allocation is putting us on a strong foundation to deliver attractive returns for years to come. With about $22 billion in capital investment last year, we again invested at the top of the industry as we continue to focus on building the largest, highest capacity, lowest marginal cost, converged broadband network in the country. Investing to build a truly differentiated network will provide long-term benefits to AT&T and the many customers, businesses and communities we serve. And if the new Trump administration is successful in extending expiring tax incentives this year, we feel there's ample opportunity for even more investment in U.S. communications infrastructure. Ultimately, we did what we said we would last year. As a result, we exited 2024 in a stronger competitive position. We still have a few things to accomplish. In 2025, we'll focus on executing against the priorities we laid out at our Analyst and Investor Day. This starts with our customers. We plan to grow 5G and fiber subscribers by offering an elevated customer experience with a compelling opportunity to enjoy both of these connectivity services from one provider. We remain focused on growing our business the right way, which we expect to achieve by once again gaining profitable customers and operating our business more efficiently. In December, we established a new $3 billion plus run rate cost savings target that runs through the end of 2027. In 2025, we'll make progress on this goal by further integrating AI throughout our operations. We also expect to realize cost savings as we evolve our technology stacks and work to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint by the end of 2029. Last month, we received FCC approval to begin the process to stop selling, transition and discontinue legacy voice services and a small number of wire centers, utilizing our AT&T phone advanced service as a replacement. This was an important first step to establish a template that supports a deliberate and planned transition to a more capable and modern communications infrastructure. Within the next few weeks, we will make detailed filings with the FCC to stop selling legacy products in about 1,300 wire centers, which is about a quarter of the wire centers across our footprint. We look forward to working with the car (ph) FCC to accelerate and advance policies and actions that stimulate investment in modernization of the U.S. communications infrastructure. On the investment front, we anticipate capital investment in the $22 billion range again this year, as we invest in modernizing our wireless network, expanding where we're able to offer fiber. We also expect to achieve our target of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5 times range in the first half of this year. This keeps us on pace to commence common stock repurchases using our initial Board approved tranche of approximately $10 billion during the second half of 2025. This is part of a broader $40 billion plus shareholder return plan that we expect to deliver over the next three years, which includes more than $20 billion in total dividend payments and an overall capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases. Under this plan, we also have an additional $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities, improve our balance sheet or deliver further capital returns to shareholders. Now before I wrap, I'd like to finish where I started, with the customer and briefly share how the AT&T guarantee builds on the vision we shared with you in December. Over the past several years, we've pivoted the AT&T brand by using our deep knowledge and insights to orient our services around putting our customers and what they want first. This has led to improvements in how customers feel about AT&T as evidenced by our broadband customer satisfaction leadership, our improving wireless Net Promoter Scores and our overall continued low churn. After over a year of research and preparation, we are taking the important step to establish a platform to differentiate our brand in the marketplace with the AT&T guarantee. AT&T is the first and only telecommunications company to offer a guarantee for both its wireless and fiber network. AT&T guarantee is a bold promise to our customers that we'll deliver connectivity that they can depend on, deals they want and the prompt, friendly service they deserve or we'll make things right if we fall short. With the AT&T guarantee, customers have peace of mind that the company stands behind our products and services in a way that no one else in our industry is doing. Our guarantee is a truly converged full company effort. It spans across both wireless and fiber, covering both consumers and small businesses. And with enterprise customers, we remain committed to providing high quality service and our contractual agreements as we always have. We were able to offer this unique promise to our customers because we own and operate scaled 5G and fiber networks, where we control the network architecture, operations and end-to-end customer experience. This allows us to provide a proactive and compelling customer guarantee that's tough to beat and an internal operating posture that focuses all of AT&T's employees on getting it right for our customers. We feel confident that our customers will repay us with loyalty, and we can attract new customers as well. So in summary, we have a clear strategy in place to advance the plan we shared at our Analyst and Investor Day. We have the right people, capabilities and differentiated assets to achieve our goals in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Pascal Desroches : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial summary on Slide 8. Overall, we're really pleased with how our team closed out the year as we continue to grow subscribers profitably. Fourth quarter revenues were up nearly 1% largely driven by wireless service and equipment revenues, as well as broadband revenues. This was partly offset by a decline in business wireline. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 2.2% as growth, primarily in Mobility and Consumer Wireline were partially offset by declines in business wireline. Adjusted EPS was $0.54 in the quarter, in line with the prior year despite $0.04 of below the line net headwinds that we outlined at the beginning of the year. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $4.8 billion, which included about $1.1 billion in pretax DIRECTV distributions. Fourth quarter cash from operating activities came at $11.9 billion, up about $500 million year-over-year. Beginning with the fourth quarter, all cash distributions from DIRECTV are now reported within cash from operating activities. However, as a reminder, starting with our first quarter of 2025 results, we will exclude all cash received from DIRECTV from reported free cash flow. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $6.8 billion with capital investment of $7.1 billion. We delivered a strong financial performance during the quarter, while absorbing strong impacts that were slightly higher than the estimate we provided on our third quarter call. Now let's take a look at the results we delivered against our 2024 financial guidance on Slide 9. For the full year, we achieved all our consolidated financial guidance. We expected Mobility service revenue growth in the 3% range and achieve growth in the 3.5% range primarily by growing profitable customer relationships. In Consumer Wireline, we met our target of 7% plus growth in broadband revenues driven by fiber revenue growth of nearly 18%. Consolidated [Technical Difficulty] grew 3.1% for the full year compared to our expectation of growth in the 3% range. Adjusted EPS for the full year came in at $2.26, which is slightly better than the high end of the $2.20 to $2.25 range we provided at our Analyst and Investor Day. As we shared previously, in 2025, we plan to report adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV. When excluding approximately $0.31 related to equity in net income of DIRECTV, full year adjusted EPS in 2024 was $1.95. Capital investment for the full year was approximately $22 billion, consistent with our guidance at the high end of the $21 billion to $22 billion range. On free cash flow, we delivered slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance in the $17 billion to $18 billion range, with full year free cash flow coming in at $17.6 billion. In 2025, we also plan to report free cash flow excluding DIRECTV. For comparison, 2024 free cash flow was $15.3 billion, excluding approximately $2.3 billion of after tax cash distributions from DIRECTV. Now let's look at our Mobility operating results on Slide 10. Our Mobility business continues to deliver strong results, growing both revenues and EBITDA for the seventh consecutive year. We posted 482,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter as we continued to successfully add high value subscribers. Mobility revenues were up 3.3% for the quarter with service revenues also up 3.3%. Fourth quarter Mobility EBITDA was up about $500 million or by 6.1% driven by growth in service revenues. Similar to recent quarters, about 100% of the year-over-year growth in our Mobility service revenues flow through to EBITDA. This is the result of sustained low churn and our focus on driving operating efficiencies. For the full year, Mobility EBITDA grew 6.3%. This is consistent with our guidance for growth in the high end of the middle-single digit range. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $56.72 in the fourth quarter, up nearly 1% year-over-year. ARPU growth continues to be largely driven by our targeted pricing actions and from plan mix. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.85%, up 1 basis point versus the prior year, while the upgrade rate declined 10 basis points to 4.6%. Customers reaching the end of their device promotions return to a more normalized level on a seasonal basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect this to continue during 2025. In prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% with Cricket phone churn substantially lower. Similar to last year, our 2025 guidance anticipates a healthy wireless market with further normalization of net adds and overall activity levels. We're confident that our Mobility business will deliver solid performance again in 2025. And we continue to expect full year growth in service revenues in the higher end of the 2% to 3% range and EBITDA in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. Now let's move to Consumer Wireline results, which are on Slide 11. Our Consumer Wireline business again delivered strong performance with 307,000 AT&T Fiber net adds, our highest ever during the fourth quarter. This solid subscriber growth reflects durable demand for AT&T Fiber as a result of its superior experience, as well as the increased pace at which we've been expanding customer locations served by our fiber network. We also believe we benefited from some pent-up demand following a one month work stoppage in the Southeast during the third quarter. AT&T Internet Air continues to perform well in the marketplace. We added 158,000 AT&T Internet Air consumer subscribers in the quarter and totaled more than 0.5 million net adds for the full year. Our combined success with AT&T Fiber and AT&T Internet Air continues to more than offset declines in our legacy copper subscriber base, which help us achieve 123,000 total broadband net adds in the quarter. Fiber ARPU was $71.71, up $1.35 sequentially and 4.7% year-over-year. The improved trend in fiber ARPU growth in 4Q was driven by pricing actions and favorable plan mix. Fourth quarter broadband revenues grew 7.8% driven by fiber revenue growth of 17.8%. In 2025, we expect fiber revenue growth in the mid-teens, which is consistent with the multiyear guidance we provided at our Analyst and Investor Day. Consumer Wireline EBITDA grew 9.8% for the quarter and 10% for the full year, which exceeded our guidance for full year growth in the mid to high-single digit range. This was driven by growth in high margin fiber revenues and by our ongoing transition away from providing service over our legacy copper network. We expect these dynamics to continue in 2025 and to drive Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth in the high-single to low double-digit range. And while our fiber investment is delivering strong returns on a standalone basis, it's also benefiting our Mobility business as we add more converged customers. Our AT&T Fiber penetration is 40% today with four out of every 10 AT&T Fiber households also choosing AT&T as their wireless provider. Both these metrics improved by about 100 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting strong demand for our fiber and 5G services together. As we discussed at our Analyst and Investor Day, over the long-term, we expect to grow our fiber penetration and our penetration of converged services within our fiber footprint. Now let's turn to Business Wireline on Slide 12. In the quarter, Business Wireline revenues declined 10%, and EBITDA was down 22% primarily due to continued industry wide secular declines in legacy services. For the full year, Business Wireline EBITDA declined 18%. This is in line with the latest guidance we provided for declines in the high-teens range. For full year 2025, we expect Business Wireline EBITDA to decline in the mid-teens range. In the fourth quarter, our Business Solutions wireless service revenues grew 3.5%, which is faster than our overall growth in Mobility service revenues. FirstNet continues to be a consistent growth category for us with wireless connections up about 300,000 sequentially, and we ended the year with more than 6.7 million total connections. Now let's move to Slide 13 for an update on our capital allocation strategy. In 2024, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining industry leading capital investment. For the full year, we reduced net debt by $8.8 billion. And during the fourth quarter, we reduced net debt by $5.7 billion sequentially. Fourth quarter net debt included a $2.4 billion non-cash FX benefit related to our foreign denominated debt. However, there was no net balance sheet impact as there was an offsetting FX loss related to associated hedges. Another item that contributed to the reduction of net debt in the fourth quarter was the completion of a distribution of about $1.5 billion in cash from previously restricted assets. This is reflected in cash from investing and therefore, did not impact our reported free cash flow. As a result of our adjusted EBITDA growth and strong cash generation, we ended 2024 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.7 times. Additionally, we lowered vendor and direct supplier financing, which more than offset securitization facilities for a net reduction of $400 million year-over-year. Over the past two years, we've reduced our vendor financing balance by about $4.7 billion. Our efforts to reduce vendor and direct supplier financing have helped us to lower our interest expense and to improve the quality and ratability of our cash flows. Given these efforts, we feel good about our combined vendor and direct supplier financing levels and do not expect to materially reduce them on a year-over-year basis in 2025. We continue to expect to close the sale of our 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG in the middle of this year. Since signing this agreement, we have received $1.7 billion in pretax cash distributions from DIRECTV and expect to receive an additional $5.9 billion in after tax cash payments related to this transaction through 2029. This includes $5.4 billion that we continue to expect this year. The strength of our operating trends, growth in our free cash flow and improvement in our balance sheet have positioned us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. As discussed at our Analyst and Investor Day, we expect to maintain our dividend per share and to begin share buybacks in the second half of 2025 once we're in this 2.5 times range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our operating momentum and capital allocation framework positions AT&T to drive shareholder value through a combination of capital appreciation and capital returns in 2025 and beyond. Now let's cover our 2025 financial guidance. Our outlook for the year is unchanged from the guidance we shared at our Analyst and Investor Day. But I'd like to highlight a few key drivers of our guidance for adjusted EPS and free cash flow in order to help you with your modeling. As mentioned earlier, beginning in the first quarter, we plan to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding DIRECTV, due to the pending 2025 disposition of our equity investment. On this basis, our guidance anticipates growth in both of these metrics this year, driven primarily by our outlook for growth in consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 3% or better. Our adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 of $1.97 to $2.07 also assumes depreciation and amortization expense in 2025 to be slightly higher than 2024 from continued investment in our 5G and fiber networks, lower interest expense from lower debt balances and an effective tax rate around 23%. Our planned share repurchases starting later this year are not expected to materially benefit our adjusted EPS in 2025. Looking a little further ahead, we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2027 as outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day. This is driven by our outlook for annual adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better as well as accumulating benefits of reducing our share count through planned share repurchases. It also assumes lower depreciation expense beyond 2025 as we complete our wireless network modernization and take legacy assets out of service. Our guidance for $16 billion plus of free cash flow this year assumes lower cash interest from lower debt balances, the absence of network termination fee payments in 2025 and lower working capital impacts in 2025 compared to 2024. Collectively, these items as well as our anticipated adjusted EBITDA growth are expected to more than offset an increase in cash taxes. Excluding DIRECTV, we expect 2025 cash taxes to be $3.3 billion, which is up about $1.5 billion from 2024 on a comparable basis. This expectation is based on current tax law, including the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation. We also expect that our free cash flow will continue to have a more ratable profile over the course of the year. As a reminder, we typically see seasonally lower free cash flow in 1Q primarily driven by the timing of device payments and annual incentive compensation payout. Also keep in mind that DIRECTV contributed $500 million to last year's first quarter free cash flow. We're excited about our outlook for the year and beyond. We're reiterating all the long-term financial and operational guidance we shared at our Analyst and Investor Day in December. Brett, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Brett Feldman : Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. John, maybe a couple of quick regulatory questions for you. First of all, on the regulatory filing about the legacy products, are there any direct cost savings that would come with this that you could potentially see in '25 if that's successful? And I think this is probably the first step in terms of heading towards a decommissioning of that copper infrastructure. How would you expect this sort of steps to proceed if you're successful with that filing? So that's number one. And then number two, on tax reform. One, just what's your view on the chance of getting that through? And you mentioned that you could go a little faster with some of the CapEx. Would that be a '25 issue or '26? And what are some of the areas do you think that you could do more spending and accelerate the plan? Thanks. John Stankey : All right, John. Good morning. So the legacy filings, first of all, what you should understand is, as we laid out our new cost savings objectives for you over the next three years as we discussed in the Analyst Day, as we gave you that detail, you can see that we are expecting that we're going to make progress in taking those costs out of the business, and that's a key foundational element to those estimates. So what you would expect here in this filing is, we've kind of factored all those into the guidance we've given you and the timing of those things. I'm not going to break out on a per central office basis exactly how long it takes us to recognize that. But these are processes that take some time is what you should think about. We have to go through notice cycles with customers. We then have to ultimately transition them. We grandfather them. So these are not things like you file, and 90 days later, you're starting to see a dramatic shift or a step function shift in costs. These are what gets us to our objectives by '29 and ultimately, reshaping the footprint in the cost structure of the business. How those steps proceed? As I said in my comments, the first step is, we now have a framework. We're now going to put the first scale test of that framework in with about 1,300 wire centers. We expect that when we do that, the commission is going to say, what do I do with 1,300 wire centers? And we're going to work collaboratively with them to build a process to move through that as quickly and expeditiously as possible. My expectations are from the dialogue that's occurring right now, the new administration is interested in finding approaches to scale these more rapidly and have an appropriate way to clear them through faster because they believe if the right policies are in place, it will, in fact, stimulate investment in the right kind of going forward technologies. And we intend to embrace that and work with them and figure out how we take 1,300 successfully through the commission and then move through another tranche as we move through that. So that's all part of the process. And it's kind of how we expected this back two years ago when we started moving down this path and putting this framework in place and building the technologies to enable it. This is kind of what we expected would be the case. And I feel good, as I mentioned I think at the Analyst Day, I think with the administration change, we kind of moved to a little bit of a tailwind in terms of the receptivity of the approach as we go through that. On the tax reform side, look, I'm hopeful and I'm optimistic that a Washington that has one party in control can figure out how to set priorities for themselves. My indications would be that from an economic growth perspective that the Republicans believe this is a key driver of what will get the economy moving in the right direction. I would certainly say from my little part of the economy, those policies would drive accelerated and stimulated investment as they did the first time we were in place. I've used this comparison, we were peaking in about $24 billion of investment a couple of years ago. It's not an accident. Our tax bill is up about the same amount that we're down in capital investment right now. I don't expect we\u2019d ever get back to $24 billion at this juncture, given how far along we are in our reinvestment strategies. But do I think that the first place I would go if I had a little bit of latitude might be to accelerate some of the fiber build, the answer to that is, yeah, I probably would look at tweaking that. And some of that might go into investment and completing the fiber plan earlier. Some of that may be returned to shareholders. We can't turn on a dime to answer your question, when you think about what occurs with the fiber build as I shared with you at the analyst conference, if you want to think about increments of $1 million a year. So if we're building $3 million right now, and we wanted to move to $4 million, that's probably a 12 month best case, 18 month worst case scenario to ramp to that level. And when you start thinking about how you gracefully do these things, increments of $1 million are kind of the graceful way to go about doing it. We\u2019re not whipsawing vendor communities, supply chains, doing things that are inappropriate. So I think about that within the course of the year. Can you scale yourself up to get to another $1 million, that\u2019s a decision that we\u2019d have to make after we saw some tangibility that the tax cuts are, in fact, going to go into place. Brett Feldman : Thanks for the question, John. We will go to next one. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess my first one for you, John, just returning to a topic that we discussed at the Analyst Day, which was this notion of home games and away games and the benefits the fiber brings to the mobile business. I'm noticing in the fourth quarter that the gains in mobile net adds among fiber customers was equal to the total net adds for the quarter and about probably 22%, 23% of gross adds. Is that something -- is there some information value in examining how those pieces fit together? And then the second question I could -- Pascal. This Reign real estate deal and the $850 million it's contributing, I guess the question is going to be was that -- was knowing that, that's coming part of the $16 billion or is it part of the plus? And how do we think about maybe as we decommission the copper plant, especially, future real estate deals contributing to this cash flow picture? Thank you. John Stankey : Hi, Dave. I don't know that I would over rotate on the information value if I understand your question correctly. I think typically, when you look at what our strategies are for how we actually penetrate within the base, there isn't necessarily perfectly a timing to what I would call the net add dynamics that occur in broadband, whether or not we're successful at penetrating. There is some activity we get on installation, which is helpful to us. But when you start thinking about what we want to do to drive up that penetration number, the base of unaddressed individuals is much larger than the base of new customers going in. And so we have to do well in that unaddressed base in order to get net adds in it. There's different strategies associated with it. Pascal, do you want to address the Reign dynamic and the fact that it doesn't run through cash flow? Pascal Desroches : Yeah. So Dave, the Reign deal is, we're accounting for it as a financing transaction. It's not going to run through cash from operations or free cash flow. It will be running through our financing section of the balance sheet. You zoom out, Dave, when I think about what are the drivers of free cash flow being 2025, it starts with our expected EBITDA growth. We also, as we highlighted at Investor Day, in 2024, there was a, call it, about $0.5 billion of headwind associated with paying out a termination fee associated with our O-RAN modernization effort. Additionally, the other tailwind you should expect is, you're going to see some benefit from interest and working capital. We have -- if you saw the way we ended the year, our interest expense was down, and I would expect that to continue into 2025. And I wouldn't expect working capital to be a major factor one way or the other. And so really, those are the dynamics driving it. David Barden : All right. Helpful. Thank you, guys, both. Appreciate it. Brett Feldman : And we will go to next question, please. Operator : Absolutely. And our next question today comes from Michael Rollins at Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good morning. You used the same or similar language around the healthy wireless market and a further normalization of net add and activity levels. Curious, if you could just put some additional context around that, how that may look similar or different than last year in terms of characteristics and how AT&T is looking at the mix between volume growth and ARPU opportunity within the '25 guidance? And just one other quick item. In the trending schedule, you added a much larger number of resale subs. I think it was up 13.5% quarter-on-quarter. I'm just curious what drove that performance and does reseller become a more significant component of Mobility service revenue growth during 2025? Thanks. John Stankey : Hi, Mike. It\u2019s good to hear from you. So I would tell you, it's the same or similar as to what we said last year, that's why there's similar language. We expect further normalization. I don't think we're seeing a whole lot different. As I said before, how we think about the customers that we want to attack that are long-term durable, sustainable customers versus what gets counted in the bucket in aggregate, they don't all necessarily represent that number. But we've seen a bit of a moderation going on, and we expect there's going to be a little bit of a moderation going on this coming year that we worked through. As with previous years, we're going to do everything we can to do both. We're going to have some volume improvement as we gain customers, and we're also going to manage the base like we effectively manage the base. I'm not going to break out for you what represents in each of those. We never do talk about those things. I don't intend to do that going forward. But you can expect that we know how to manage the subscription business, and we know how to balance the two out. There's going to be pockets of our base out there where we can move them through continuum of either getting more value through different plans or finding pockets where maybe we're priced differently than the market, what needs to be as well as growing subscribers. And we'll do both, and we'll do it effectively. What you're seeing on the resale side is, I think we've been really clear and we indicated that we were a provider to DISH and their migration and how they've been handling their customer accounts. We're a beneficiary, I think, of some of their decisions as to what networks they're putting their customers on and how they're operating that, that was certainly not the only contributor but a significant contributor to what's occurring in that. And then, we\u2019ve also had some success in some other MVNO reseller accounts that are now starting to generate some volume as well that are contributing to that. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Brett Feldman : Thanks, Mike. We\u2019re going to go to next question, operator. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Benjamin Swinburne : Thanks. Good morning. Question on fiber and one on Mobility. Pascal, I think you mentioned maybe some pent-up demand benefited the fourth quarter coming off the labor strikes at the end of Q3. Any ability to size that for us? And then I'm curious, you guys had really strong fiber ARPU growth in the fourth quarter and the year. We've seen some of our cable competitors get more aggressive with their own converged offers. Doesn't seem like that's having any impact? I'm just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your confidence in fiber ARPU growth heading into '25. And then just on Mobility, great churn results. Any update on sort of how you're thinking about gross adds and whether that can maybe inflect positive in '25 as Jen and the team kind of put a lot of their initiatives into place? Thanks so much. John Stankey : Hi, Ben. So look, the pent-up demand dynamic, it's not substantial. I just think that there's -- there clearly was some -- there were some customers after we were out of the market for 30 days in the Southeast that decided they were going to wait, and we were able to work through that effectively. And I think that's a certain amount of what you're expecting or what we saw in the fourth quarter of turning in that 307,000 number. I don't see anything in our overall trends that suggest anything different moving forward right now. We've given you an indication. There's a variety of things that drive kind of what you should expect in volumes in fiber in a quarter, one of which is the size of the footprint and what we have to sell into. And then, of course, there's a seasonality dynamic goes into that. So as we move into the first quarter, seasonality adjustments tend to be a little bit slower than what we see otherwise. And we still have good footprint to sell into, but that pent-up demand will disappear. So you should expect that, that's not going to carry into the first quarter. Exactly what that number is, I don't know that I can precisely put a number on it, but I don't see anything in the market that suggests to me right now that there's any fundamental trend difference in how we're penetrating the market and what we're doing overall. And the ARPU growth, what I would tell you is, as I just indicated, we continue to manage the base effectively and look for opportunities to either remove customers up in plan to buy higher speeds or work on pricing adjustments where it makes sense to do that. We did get a benefit of a price increase on some portions of our cohort that work through the fourth quarter that I think you're seeing roll through that. But there's also a dynamic of a higher percentage of the base moving into fiber versus copper legacy products that usually comes with a step-up in ARPU that we get improvements on. And we're going to continue to actively manage that, but you should understand we're actively managing that underneath an umbrella. We're still lower than cable on an ARPU basis, and that's one of the reasons we do as well as we do and why we don't feel that we need to necessarily discount a better product when we're putting two together is because we are selling currently in the market on kind of underneath cable's pricing umbrella at a more competitive price. So that still continues to be the case as we move forward. What I would expect on where we are in the mobile side is should our gross add performance get a little bit better relative to what we want to do on the share side in certain segments, yes. But do I expect that we're going to be looking at outsized numbers, given the overall pool of growth is getting smaller? No. Pascal, I don't know, if there's anything you want to add to what I shared there. Pascal Desroches : No. Look, I think all well said. Benjamin Swinburne : Great. Thanks so much. Brett Feldman : We will got to the next question, please. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from Peter Supino at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Peter Supino : Hi. Good morning, everybody. A question on upgrades and one on immigration. On upgrades, I'm not going to ask you about iPhone innovation. I'm wondering, if you could comment on just the average age of the phones in your customer fleet in the postpaid phone business. And maybe you describe directionally how that number has evolved and whether we're approaching an inflection point for upgrade simply based on aging as we get into the middle of the 5G cycle here? And then on immigration, if you could comment on the sensitivity of your postpaid phone business to potential major changes in immigration statistics over the next couple of years after the change in the administration? Thank you. John Stankey : Hi, Peter. So I would say that I don't see anything in the data that we're looking at that would suggest there's any fundamental shift going on in customers' desires to hold handsets. I\u2019m sure, different carriers have different points of view on this. And if you're investing heavier in promotions, you may see a shift. You may incent more customers to choose to upgrade. And the richer those promotions get, the higher that rate, and therefore, you walk away and say, well, maybe there's a shift going on. I think we are pretty disciplined in what we chose to do over the course of the quarter. And if I would tell you when we did forecast of what percentage of our customers might be coming in for an upgrade, we're not seeing anything out of pattern relative to that, given how we're performing in the market and what offers we're putting in the market. And I'm not expecting to see that change anytime in the near future. The customer will ultimately make that decision. And of course, later in this year, we'll end up with some new devices coming into the market. And once we know what those devices are and how compelling they are, customers will decide whether or not they want to shift that dynamic and move at a higher rate. But right now, I didn't see anything that occurred in the fourth quarter that I can explain from what were the offers in the market and was it something that somebody wanted to do gift giving on based on what those incentives were as opposed to what I would call a fundamental shift in customers' points of view of their fleet getting more tired, so to speak. The fact of the matter is phones perform pretty well. They're more durable. People know how to take care of them more. There's better insurance and upgrade processes in place to keep devices in customers' hands for a longer period of time. I don't think those things have fundamentally shifted in the market. On immigration, I'd probably say relative to the industry, we're a bit less sensitive to it because as you've heard me say, we maybe don't play as effectively as I'd like in that part of the market or had what I would think should be more of our fair share. I guess the good news is, if there is a downward trend on it, we'll be less impacted. It doesn't mean that I wouldn't like to be more effective in that space. But we just aren't quite as well distributed in that segment of the market as maybe some other folks are. Now in aggregate, do I think that having more people living in the United States is good for a business like ours? I think the answer is yes, because we like economic growth in this country, and part of what we all want to see is that the economy continues to grow and services continue to be invested in. And I think a key element to that is we have to have the right immigration policies. And I\u2019m hopeful that as policymakers kind of go through the next number of months and they think about what they want to do, they get to an appropriate place that understands that the U.S. economy to continue to grow, we need smart immigration. We need to do this the right way, and that is in everybody\u2019s interest to do that. And hopefully, the wise minds prevail, and that\u2019s what takes place, and we\u2019ll see what happens. Brett Feldman : Thanks for the question, Peter. We are going to go to the next question, please. Operator : Absolutely. And our next question today comes from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could maybe expand, John, on your earlier comments around the broadband market and the competitive trends within it. I mean clearly, some of your competitors in the cable space are getting a little bit more aggressive on pricing. It sounds like you don't see the need to follow that. But I'm just sort of curious whether you expect there to be sort of more opportunities for jump balls or a little bit more kind of competition within the sort of existing non-home movers in the market going into 2025? And then separately, on the Business Wireline outlook, no, that's a relatively muted outlook, not different from what you talked about in 2024. But I'm wondering, if you see any opportunities on the horizon here that could jump start sort of top line opportunities, whether that's from a fiber connectivity for AI or otherwise? I think you sort of moderate those EBITDA declines sooner rather than later. Thank you. John Stankey : Hi. Good morning, Jim. I don't see a shift right now in our tactics in the broadband market. I mean, as I've said before, where we have fiber, we win. We win because it's a better product. And the other tailwind, if you want to call it that, that I think we have that I've mentioned and talked about in the Analyst Day is, it's a heck of a lot easier to sell into a market where we're 40%, 50% build as opposed -- built as opposed to a market where we're just starting to build. And we're getting more and more markets where our distribution of fiber and where we are in the build starts to give us scale in the metropolitan area. So we get more effective in that case in the latter stages of our penetration where we can begin to more efficiently buy mass media awareness, word of mouth starts to show up with customers who do their own promoting on our behalf because they have the product, they talk to their friends. So yeah, I would expect that our competitors are having to do things to adjust because we continue to win. But we're fundamentally winning on the product being better. We're not necessarily winning because people are shopping for a lower price right now. And I actually think the lower price shoppers are probably migrating more towards fixed wireless. And they maybe have less scale demands as we've talked about. Our product is the one for the scaled household that requires great performance and consistent performance. And that's what we're doing very well in. And I think we know how to play in that space, and we'll continue to do that. And ultimately, as general consumption continues to increase year-over-year, we think fiber will be waiting there to pick up more and more customers as they need that high performance. So we feel really good about that. We gave you an outlook at the Analyst Day is kind of what we expect in recovery in business. And when we did that, it was, as we shared with you, driven by an orientation away from our legacy products. The good news is, we had a lot of share, and we did really well in that space. The bad news is, some of those products are in a secular repositioning right now. And they're repositioning to fiber and high bandwidth connectivity based products and services, which we'll also do well in. But dollar for dollar is a little bit of a trade down when you make those transitions. And as we forecasted for you what we thought the recovery in that segment would be, it included what our expectations were and being effective in deploying our fiber and ultimately picking up on some of that transition. So do I expect that we can go in and probably be a little more effective in middle mile infrastructure as AI becomes more critical in places? Yeah. We expect we will be. Is that something that we expected when we gave you our forecast moving forward? Yes. Is it stuff we're working on right now that we'll have some success? Yes. Did I see in the fourth quarter probably some of our best fiber growth in business across the board in all segments and what we've historically had? Yes. Is that expected? Yes. Should it continue? Yes. We still have to outrun the legacy base, which -- that's just a mathematical equation over time that we have to work our way through. So I don't think it's going to change anything that we shared with you in terms of the direction and performance of the business. Brett Feldman : All right. Thanks for the\u2026 Pascal Desroches : One other point is on AIA. We -- as it relates to business, we continue to believe it is a great opportunity for us. If you look, we introduced a product middle part of last year. And so we think we have plenty of room to run as it relates to AIA for business. Brett Feldman : And that's AT&T Internet Air for business, that's our internal acronym. Pascal Desroches : Yes. Brett Feldman : All right. We will take the next question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sebastiano Petti : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe, John, kind of sticking with business, but from the wireless side, obviously, you broke out the wireless service revenue growth maybe outperformed consolidated ability growth on the business side. Can you maybe pack -- unpack a little bit of what you're seeing in that market, John, obviously, against the context of the broader industry and normalization there? At the Analyst Day, you did outline that AT&T does have a share opportunity, given your mix of customers across the board in the Fortune 1000 and how you see that evolving? But you also -- it seems like there's tailwinds in that business as well, whether it be from corporate liable, maybe demand growing. So it'd be helpful if you could perhaps unpack that and how you're thinking about that evolving over a multiyear basis within AT&T? Thank you. John Stankey : So Sebastiano, good morning, I would tell you the biggest driver, I think, of our success in business over time is, how well we do in improving our distribution, our effectiveness in the mid and low-end of the market. And that's, I think, the biggest driver and that -- we all like the fact that if there's investment in the country and the economy grows, businesses grow, and they consume more in communication services. That's a good thing, and it's an important thing for our industry, and we tend to be highly correlated to that. But in terms of us doing better as a company and where I think the operating leverage is, it\u2019s in us getting better in our distribution structure in that segment of the market. And as I shared with you, that's our intent when we went through the Analyst Day. Those don't change in 30 days. These are things that require some work and partnerships. And they require you to work with those partners in ways that you give them the right kind of tools to be more effective in prospecting and converting. And we're midstream on doing that. And our expectations on ramp, back to what I shared to Jim's question or part of what's into our forecast that we've given you an improvement in the segment and what we're going to ultimately be able to do. So that's how I think about for AT&T, what we need to do to be more effective in business and where there's opportunity. And it really gets down to how effectively we distribute. And I don't know that there's -- if you want to call that tailwind, I just think that's hard to pick and shovel work that we kind of have to do as our business, and that's the kind of thing that we do. Brett Feldman : Hi. Thanks for the question, Sebastiano. Operator, we are going to take our last question. Operator : Absolutely. And our final question today will come from Tim Horan at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan : Thanks, guys. You've been pretty early in migrating your operations and networks to the cloud and open source. I'm sure you've seen DeepSeek has created a much lower cost, large language model out there. Can you maybe just give us your thoughts on using cloud and AI to both improve relationships with customers, improve your product and lowering your overall expenses? And then maybe just the same thing on your infrastructure, just any updated thoughts how you can use your infrastructure to support AI? Thank you. John Stankey : Good morning, Tim. We've actually, I think this is a place we've already done a lot of work and picked up a lot of benefits in terms of how you operate internally. We've -- if you kind of look at our cost of service dynamics, what we've been able to do in our call centers and how we operate within our customer base, a lot of that has been driven by AI tool application. And it's not that we're necessarily exclusively replacing individuals with the technology, but we're making them a lot more effective and efficient in how they handle customer needs and then complementing that with customer supported AI. And when you look at things like our call volumes despite the fact that we're growing, our customer base dropping 30% year-over-year, that's driven by the application of that technology and what we're able to do with it. We've used it a lot internally in our operations. We're seeing demonstrative improvements in our code effectiveness. And I shared this on a previous call, we're spending less right now to develop new code internally and getting more. And it's through the application of AI and the technology and what we're able to do with generative AI. I fully expect, as I mentioned earlier in kind of my comments on CNBC, we're very early in this technology cycle right now. And this is a seminal technology cycle. It's going to be every bit as big as the founding of the Internet when it's all said and done. And because we're very early in it, we should expect there's going to be days we wake up like this one when somebody comes in and says they figured out a way to get as much benefit out of the model by consuming less power or using less processing capability or they fine-tune the models to work in a particular domain area more effectively or they can run locally as opposed to in the cloud, which is going to open up and facilitate new applications and business models. I would expect for a nascent technology like this that we're going to have those moments because necessity is the mother of invention. And there's a lot of money, an awful lot of money and a lot of creative minds working on this and people are going to come up with better ways to apply it. And we're all going to have to stay on our game to make sure we use it effectively, so none of us are in a disadvantaged position relative to our competitors on cost structure effectiveness. I think there are places where I would like to see our business get better at doing this, which is using the data that we have to start doing things that are unique to us, which handling particular customers and segments of the base and those that we don't have as customers and understanding how we price and attack those things and using the unique data sets that we have around our infrastructure, how that lines up to particular customer segments, in particular, industries to get more effective in the market. If I were to say I had a goal for 2025, I would like to this time next year be talking about good momentum we've received in business as a result of executing on some of those things moving forward. And finally, I'd just say we continue to find innovative ways to use it in our business today. And maybe I'm not being as effective at talking about all the great things we've done to effectively use that, but we're tuning our RF capabilities dynamically in our wireless network today based on traffic flows and customer movement using machine learning capabilities and AI. And those things always help us on the margin, and we're going to continue to do them moving forward. Appreciate the question, Tim. Let me go ahead and just like to close this out for all of you. And I would just say one thing. We outlined for you what we intended to do in 2024 in January of the year. And when you kind of look at what we delivered, we did exactly what we said we were going to do, if not a little bit more. And I think what we've hopefully demonstrated to you over the course of '24 and the previous years, our execution is getting very consistent. And that's not a surprise as we refocused the business, and we put our energy towards being a great communications company. We're on that learning curve, and we're getting more consistent and better at what we do and we still have opportunities to improve upon the progress we've made. This is going to be an important year for us as we hit the midpoint of this year, and we have an opportunity to recalibrate on our capital allocation. And that's been the deliberate plan to do that. We look forward to that moment, and we think we're in a great position to continue to invest in this business and drive the same level of consistency and improvement that you've seen over the last couple of years. So thank you very much for your interest in us. And I hope everybody has a good rest of the year. Brett Feldman : Operator, you can go ahead and end the call.",
